2005-01-04,"The victims of the tsunami pay the price of war on Iraq US and British aid is dwarfed by the billions both spend on slaughter Tuesday 4 January 2005 08.43 GMT There has never been a moment like it on British television . 
The Vicar of Dibley , one of our gentler sitcoms , was bouncing along with its usual bonhomie on New Year 's Day when it suddenly hit us with a scene from another world . 
Two young African children were sobbing and trying to comfort each other after their mother had died of Aids . 
How on earth , I wondered , would the show make us laugh after that ? 
It made no attempt to do so . 
One by one the characters , famous for their parochial boorishness , stood in front of the camera wearing the white armbands which signalled their support for the Make Poverty History campaign . 
You would have to have been hewn from stone not to cry . 
The timing was perfect . 
In my local Oxfam shop last week , people were queueing to the door to pledge money for the tsunami fund . 
A pub on the other side of town raised # 1,000 on Saturday night . 
In the pot on the counter of the local newsagent 's there must be nearly # 100 . 
The woman who runs the bakery told me about the homeless man she had seen , who emptied his pockets in the bank , saying `` I just want to do my bit '' , while the whole queue tried not to cry . 
Over the past few months , reviewing the complete lack of public interest in what is happening in the Democratic Republic of Congo , and the failure , in the west , to mobilise effective protests against the continuing atrocities in Iraq , I had begun to wonder whether we had lost our ability to stand in other people 's shoes . 
I have now stopped wondering . 
The response to the tsunami shows that , however we might seek to suppress it , we can not destroy our capacity for empathy . 
But one obvious question recurs . 
Why must the relief of suffering , in this unprecedentedly prosperous world , rely on the whims of citizens and the appeals of pop stars and comedians ? 
Why , when extreme poverty could be made history with a minor redeployment of public finances , must the poor world still wait for homeless people in the rich world to empty their pockets ? 
The obvious answer is that governments have other priorities . 
And the one that leaps to mind is war . 
If the money they have promised to the victims of the tsunami still falls far short of the amounts required , it is partly because the contingency fund upon which they draw in times of crisis has been spent on blowing people to bits in Iraq . 
The US government has so far pledged $ 350m to the victims of the tsunami , and the UK government # 50m -LRB- $ 96m -RRB- . 
The US has spent $ 148 billion on the Iraq war and the UK # 6bn -LRB- $ 11.5 bn -RRB- . 
The war has been running for 656 days . 
This means that the money pledged for the tsunami disaster by the United States is the equivalent of one and a half day 's spending in Iraq . 
The money the UK has given equates to five and a half days of our involvement in the war . 
It looks still worse when you compare the cost of the war to the total foreign aid budget . 
The UK has spent almost twice as much on creating suffering in Iraq as it spends annually on relieving it elsewhere . 
The United States gives just over $ 16bn in foreign aid : less than one ninth of the money it has burnt so far in Iraq . 
The figures for war and aid are worth comparing because , when all the other excuses for the invasion of Iraq were stripped away , both governments explained that it was being waged for the good of the Iraqis . 
Let us , for a moment , take this claim at face value . 
Let us suppose that the invasion and occupation of Iraq had nothing to do with power , domestic politics or oil , but were , in fact , components of a monumental aid program . 
And let us , with reckless generosity , assume that more people in Iraq have gained as a result of this aid program than lost . 
To justify the war , even under these wildly unsafe assumptions , George Bush and Tony Blair would have to show that the money they spent was a cost-efficient means of relieving human suffering . 
As it was sufficient to have made a measurable improvement in the lives of all the 2.8 billion people living in absolute poverty , and as there are only 25 million people in Iraq , this is simply not possible . 
Even if you ignore every other issue - such as the trifling matter of mass killing - the opportunity costs of the Iraq war categorise it as a humanitarian disaster . 
Indeed , such calculations suggest that , on cost grounds alone , a humanitarian war is a contradiction in terms . 
But our leaders appear to have lost the ability to distinguish between helping people and killing them . 
The tone of Blair 's New Year message was almost identical to that of his tear-jerking insistence that we understand the Iraqi people must be bombed for their own good . 
The US marines who have now been dispatched to Sri Lanka to help the rescue operation were , just a few weeks ago , murdering the civilians -LRB- for this , remember , is an illegal war -RRB- , smashing the homes and evicting the entire population of the Iraqi city of Falluja . 
Even within the official aid budgets the two aims are confused : $ 8.9 bn of the aid money the US spends is used for military assistance , anti-drugs operations , counter-terrorism and the Iraq relief and reconstruction fund -LRB- otherwise known as the Halliburton benevolent trust -RRB- . 
For Bush and Blair , the tsunami relief operation and the Iraq war are both episodes in the same narrative of salvation . 
The civilised world rides out to rescue foreigners from their darkness . 
While they spend the money we gave them to relieve suffering on slaughtering the poor , the world must rely for disaster relief on the homeless man emptying his pockets . 
If our leaders were as generous in helping people as they are in killing them , no one would ever go hungry .

2005-01-06,"` These are the people we never see on TV ' A new film reveals how the war hit a corner of Iraq the world had overlooked : Kurdistan . 
Michael Howard meets its director Turtles Can Fly : ` An anti-war movie without slogans . ' 
As a Kurd , Bahman Gobadi knows that opportunity can grow out of tragedy . 
That belief helps to explain why , two weeks after the fall of Saddam Hussein in the spring of 2003 , he slipped across the border from his native Iran and headed for Baghdad . 
With him he carried a copy of his second feature film , Marooned in Iraq , a road movie about a group of Iranian-Kurdish musicians seeking lost love in Saddam 's benighted land . 
Turtles Can Fly -LRB- Lakposhtha Ham Parvaz Mikonand -RRB- `` I wanted to be the first to screen a film in Baghdad after the removal of the great dictator , '' he said last week in Arbil , the main Iraqi Kurdish city . 
`` Being caught watching such a movie under the former regime would have almost certainly meant death . 
I was so delighted that Saddam had gone . '' 
But Gobadi had also packed a small video camera , which whirred away as he passed through scores of impoverished Kurdish villages en route to the capital . 
Back in Tehran after the screening , he looked at the footage . 
`` What I saw was startling : a land full of mines and refugee tents and disabled children ... arms sellers , abandoned tanks , mortars . '' 
He could n't sleep . 
`` Every time I closed my eyes , I was haunted by those images . 
There was something telling me to go back and make another movie . 
So I smuggled myself back over the border and started work . '' 
This was the beginning of Turtles Can Fly , the first feature film to emerge from post-Saddam Iraq . 
It is a powerful cry on behalf of children everywhere caught up in despotism and war . 
Filmed on location last winter , using minimal equipment in the mountainous terrain of Iraqi Kurdistan , Turtles paints a radically different picture of life in Iraq from the one most western audiences have seen on their news channels . 
Gobadi is a deeply political film-maker , but his nuanced approach skillfully avoids the naive blustering of many on the anti-war left . 
`` It is an anti-war movie without slogans . '' 
He chose the title in part , he says , because `` people might think it was some kind of Disney film '' . 
As with A Time for Drunken Horses , his acclaimed first film , the central characters are children . 
They are all first-time actors , some with serious physical disabilities , from whom Gobadi has coaxed astonishing performances . 
The story follows a group of Iraqi Kurdish orphans in a refugee camp on the Turkish border on the eve of the US-led invasion . 
The children carry the physical and mental scars of life under Saddam 's regime with stoicism and not a little humor . 
Gobadi 's aim , he says , was to present a portrait of the `` pain and surrealism '' of war and its effects on Iraqis with `` naturalness and honesty '' . 
`` These are the people we never see or hear from on TV , '' he says . 
`` President Bush and Saddam had become the superstars on the satellite channels . 
Iraqi people were just extras . 
So I wanted my stars to be the children , with Saddam and Bush in the background . '' 
Turtles Can Fly is as bold a presentation of the Kurdish experience as has appeared on the big screen since the great Turkish Kurdish director Yilmaz Guney made Yol . 
And it has clearly touched a nerve among Iraq 's Kurds . 
A week after the film 's premiere in Arbil , Gobadi still bore the bruises from what he described as `` the astonishing reaction '' of the audience . 
`` They almost hugged me to death , '' he said . 
`` I was telling a part of their pain and their memories . 
I take it as a compliment . 
If they had not believed what was in the film , they would not have reacted like that . '' 
It is Gobadi 's biggest production to date , involving thousands of Kurdish villagers as extras , as well as real US soldiers and helicopters . 
And he admits that without the help of the Kurdish Regional Government , led by Nechirvan Barzani , the film would never have been made . 
`` We did n't have the money , or any sophisticated equipment , so their help made the difference . '' 
Filming was tough , he says . 
`` We endured hours of freezing weather , filming in the mud and the mountains . 
And believe me , what these children did in my film and put up with for my film , the Hollywood children could never do . 
The children were acting their lives . 
That 's why they seem so real . '' 
Gobadi was born in 1969 in the border town of Baneh in Iranian Kurdistan . 
As a student , he worked for a radio station before joining a group of amateur film-makers in the city Sanandaj . 
With their help , he directed his first short films . 
In Tehran , where he had moved to attend film classes -LRB- he dropped out before graduating -RRB- , Gobadi directed a number of award-winning short films . 
In 1999 , he was Abbas Kiarostami 's first assistant on The Wind Will Carry Us , which proved a crucial stepping stone . 
For Turtles he teamed up once more with cameraman Shahriar Assadi - `` He 's a Kurd at heart '' - and persuaded Hussein Alizadeh , one of Iran 's leading composers , to provide the eerily beautiful soundtrack . 
Variety magazine recently dubbed Gobadi `` the poet laureate of the Kurdish cinema '' . 
Yet he dismisses talk of a Kurdish cinema as premature . 
`` When we have cinemas in every Kurdish town , and when Kurdish language and culture on film is no longer viewed as a rare and exotic bird by the film community , perhaps then we can talk of a Kurdish cinema . 
I want to register the Kurds on the cultural map . '' 
Gobadi now lives in Tehran , because that is where the Iranian film industry is based . 
`` But it 's just my body that lives there , '' he says . 
`` My spirit and my heart are in Kurdistan . '' 
Turtles Can Fly is released tomorrow .

2005-01-09,"Bush ` the king ' blows $ 50m on coronation President 's lavish inauguration is ` obscene ' when US troops are dying in Iraq war , say critics Sunday 9 January 2005 00.46 GMT It will be one of the biggest parties in American history , but half of the country will be left out . 
With a price tag of up to $ 50 million , President George W Bush 's inauguration in 11 days ' time will be an unashamed celebration of Red America 's victory over Blue America in last November 's election . 
It is going to be the most expensive , most security-obsessed event in the history of Washington DC . 
An army of 10,000 police , secret service officers and FBI agents will patrol the capital for four days of massive celebrations that some critics have derided as reminiscent of the lavish shindigs thrown by Louis XIV , France 's extravagant Sun King . 
More than 150,000 people , nearly all Republicans whose tickets are a reward for election work , will pack the Mall to hear Bush take his oath of office on 20 January . 
There will be nine official balls , countless unofficial ones , parades and a concert hosted by Bush 's daughters , Jenna and Barbara . 
Amid the official pageantry will be many huge parties laid on by companies wishing to win favor with Washington 's power players . 
Anyone who is anyone in Republican circles will be in town . 
Many Democrats will be leaving . 
With so many big names in one place , security measures will include road blocks , anti-aircraft guns guarding the skies and sniper teams patrolling the rooftops . 
Many observers say it is all too much . 
` We have elected a President who seems to have quite a monarchical role . 
It is a bit of a coronation , ' said Larry Haas , a former official in Bill Clinton 's White House . 
Certainly , Bush 's inauguration will be an orgy of gladhanding and partying by the Republican faithful from all over the country . 
One Washington hotel , the Mandarin Oriental , is offering visitors four nights in its Presidential Suite for $ 200,000 . 
The price tag includes a 24-hour butler , a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce or Humvee , daily champagne and caviar and a flight to the hotel in a private jet . 
One highlight of the bonanza is the Black Tie and Boots Ball organised by Bush 's home state of Texas , with the President as star guest . 
Ten thousand tickets sold out in less than 50 minutes , and are now trading privately at $ 1,300 each . 
Another is the Commander-in-Chief 's Ball where Bush will honor American soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
This is billed as the centrepiece of the inauguration , which itself has a theme tinged with the idea of military service . 
All the partying is being condemned by many commentators as in poor taste for a nation fighting a bloody war . 
Carroll Wilson , editor of the Texas newspaper the Times Record , has called the cost obscene and ' a horrendous waste ' . 
` There 's something inherently embarrassing about spending $ 50m on a party that will start and end in the blink of a very red eye , ' he added . 
The fighting in Iraq has provoked calls for the celebrations to be toned down , as they were during the two world wars when some were even canceled . 
Bush 's second inauguration will be the first in wartime since President Richard Nixon took office in 1969 during the Vietnam conflict . 
Yet the partying is being intensified . 
The Commander-in-Chief 's Ball is being hailed by organisers as a fitting tribute to American soldiers on active service . 
More than 2,000 troops and their partners , selected by the Pentagon , will take part . 
Most have served in Iraq or Afghanistan or are about to go there . 
The parades will have a stronger than normal military theme . 
That angers many anti-war protesters who say the lavish celebration is inappropriate during conflict . 
Some conservative commentators have even joined the fray , contrasting the spending with a recent scandal over a shortage of armor for American soldiers and their vehicles . 
A huge series of demonstrations is now being planned which organisers say will be much larger than the ones that marked Bush 's first inauguration after the contested Florida recount in 2000 . 
` We want our voices to be heard , ' said a spokesman for the Answer Coalition , which is co-ordinating the protests . 
The huge security presence means there is likely to be little disruption , especially of the oath-taking ceremony itself . 
More vulnerable may be the corporate events taking place all over the city . 
The $ 50m bill is mostly being paid by private donations from people and firms currying political favor . 
With a strict ban on large single donations to active political campaigns , the inauguration offers a rare chance for companies and individuals to lavish large sums of money on the President and his party simultaneously . 
The big donors are split into ` underwriters ' , who stumped up $ 250,000 each , and ` sponsors ' , who merely shelled out $ 100,000 . 
Both gain access to a variety of events that will be attended by Bush . 
The donors are a familiar roster of Republican supporters and big business . 
They include firms in the President 's former business , oil , such as Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco , former Enron president Richard Kinder and Texas oil baron Boone Pickens , who also gave $ 500,000 to the anti-John Kerry campaign of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth . 
Though the guests will be celebrating Bush 's victory , some Washington insiders will also be keeping a keen eye on the jockeying for position that has already begun for the next election . 
` The clock to 2008 starts ticking the second after Bush finishes his oath , ' Haas said ` At that moment Republicans begin moving into position for that . 
Bush should enjoy his moment while he can . ' 
"
2005-01-11,"On November 8 , the American army launched its biggest ever assault on the Iraqi city of Falluja , considered a stronghold for rebel fighters . 
The US said the raid had been a huge success , killing 1,200 insurgents . 
Most of the city 's 300,000 residents , meanwhile , had fled for their lives . 
What really happened in the siege of Falluja ? 
In a joint investigation for the Guardian and Channel 4 News , Iraqi doctor Ali Fadhil compiled the first independent reports from the devastated city , where he found scores of unburied corpses , rabid dogs - and a dangerously embittered population Watch an extract from the documentary It all started at my house in Baghdad . 
I packed my equipment , the camera and the tripod . 
Tariq , my friend , told me not to take it with us . 
`` The fighters might search the car and think that we are spies . '' 
Tariq was frightened about our trip , even though he is from Falluja and we had permission from one group of fighters to enter under their protection . 
But Tariq , more than anyone , understands that the fighters are no longer just one group . 
He is quite a character , Tariq : 32 and an engineer with a masters degree in embryo implantation , he works now at a human rights institute called the Democratic Studies Institute for Human Rights and Democracy in Baghdad . 
He is also deeply into animal rights . 
Foolishly , I took a pill to try to keep down the flu , which made me sleepy . 
It was 9am when we crossed the main southern gate out of Baghdad , taking care to stay well clear of American convoys . 
The southern gate is the scene of daily attacks on the Americans by the insurgents - either a car-bomb or an ambush with rocket-propelled grenades . 
It took just 20 minutes from Baghdad to reach the area known as the `` triangle of death '' , where the kidnapped British contractor Kenneth Bigley was held and finally beheaded in the town of Latifya . 
It is supposed to be a US military-controlled zone , but insurgents set up checkpoints here . 
As the road became more rural and more isolated , I got nervous that at any moment we would be stopped by carjackers and robbed of our expensive equipment . 
At a checkpoint a hooded face came to the window ; he was carrying an old AK47 on his shoulder and looking for a donation towards the jihad . 
There were six fighters in total , all hooded . 
The driver and Tariq both made a donation ; I was frightened he would search the car and find the camera , so I gave him my Iraqi doctor 's ID card , hoping that would work . 
He apologised and asked that we excuse him . 
Now , there was nothing ahead but the sky and the desert . 
It was 1.30 pm and a bad time to use this road ; we had been told that carjackers were particularly active at this time of day . 
Tariq pointed out four young men dressed in red , their two motorbikes parked by the side of the road . 
They were planting a small , improvised explosive device made out of a tin of cooking oil for the next American convoy to leave the base outside Falluja . 
It was 3.30 pm before we got to Habbanya , a tourist resort on a lake supplied with fresh water by the Euphrates , which was once controlled by Uday , Saddam 's oldest son . 
It was here that Fallujans , who used to be wealthy as they supplied a lot of the top military for Saddam 's army , came for holidays . 
Now the place was freezing , and full of refugees . 
All the holiday houses were crammed with people , sometimes two families to a room . 
The first family we came across had been there since a month before the attack started . 
A man called Abu Rabe'e came up . 
He was 59 and used to be a builder ; he said he had a message for our camera . 
`` We 're not looking for this sort of democracy , this attacking of the city and the people with planes and tanks and Humvees . '' 
He had also fled Falluja with his family . 
They were all living in a former mechanic 's garage in Habbanya . 
Most of the people we spoke to in Habbanya were poor and uneducated , and had fled Falluja in anticipation of the US attack . 
Some were in tents ; others were sharing the old honeymoon suites where newlyweds used to come when this was a holiday resort . 
They squabbled among themselves to persuade me to film the conditions they were living in . 
There was still a fairground in Habbanya , but nothing was working . 
In the middle of the bumper cars an old lady had pitched a tent with bricks , where she was living with her son . 
I tried to talk to her but she told me to go away . 
There was no cooking gas in Habbanya , so the Fallujan refugees were cutting down trees to keep warm and cook food . 
Then someone came up and said the resistance fighters had heard we were asking questions . 
We decided to put the camera away and go to a friendly village that our driver knew . 
It was also filled with refugees from Falluja . 
One 50-year-old man , a major in the Iraqi Republican Guards under the former regime , took us in . 
There were four families squeezed into one apartment , all of them once wealthy . 
The major , like the others , was sacked after the liberation when the US disbanded the army and police . 
Now jobless , his house in Falluja was wrecked and he was a refugee with his five children and wife near the town where he used to spend his holidays . 
He was angry with the Americans , but also with the Iraqi rebels , whom he blamed , alongside the clerics in the mosques , for causing Falluja to be wrecked . 
`` The mujahideen and the clerics are responsible for the destruction that happened to our city ; no one will forgive them for that , '' he said with bitterness . 
`` Why are you blaming them - why do n't you blame the Americans and Allawi ? '' 
said Omar , the owner of the apartment . 
`` We told the mujahideen to leave it to us ordinary Fallujans , but those bloody bastards , the sheikhs and the clerics , are busy painting some bloody mad picture of heaven and martyrs and the victory of the mujahideen , '' said Ali , another refugee . 
`` And , of course , the kids believe every word those clerics say . 
They 're young and naive , and they forget that this is a war against the might of the machine of the American army . 
So they let those kids die like this and our city gets blown up with the wind . '' 
I wanted to ask the tough old Republican guard why they had let these young muj have the run of the city , but I actually did n't have to . 
I remember being in Falluja just before the fighting started and seeing a crowd gathered around a sack that was leaking blood . 
A piece of white A4 paper was stuck on to the sack , which read : `` Here is the body of the traitor . 
He has confessed to acting as a spotter for American planes and was paid $ 100 a day . '' 
At the same time as we were standing looking at the sack , I knew I would be able to buy a CD of the man in this sack making his confession before he was beheaded in any CD shop in Falluja . 
These were the people who controlled Falluja now - not old majors from Saddam 's army . 
In the morning we went back towards Falluja and heard that there were queues of people waiting to try to get back into the city . 
The government had made an announcement saying that the people from some districts could start to go back home ; they promised compensation . 
About midday we got a mile east of the city and saw that four queues had formed near the American base . 
They were mostly men , waiting for US military ID to allow them back home . 
The men were angry : `` This is a humiliation . 
I say no more than that . 
These IDs are to make us bow Fallujan heads in shame , '' one of them said . 
I met Major Paul Hackett , a marine officer in the Falluja liaison base . 
He said that the US military was not trying to humiliate anyone , but that the IDs were necessary for security . 
`` I mean , my understanding is that ultimately they can hang this ID card on a wall and keep it as a souvenir , '' he said . 
They took prints of all my fingers , two pictures of my face in profile , and then photographed my iris . 
I was now eligible to go into Falluja , just like any other Fallujan . 
But it was late by then , somewhere near 5pm -LRB- the curfew is at 6pm -RRB- . 
After that anyone who moves inside the city will be shot on sight by the US military . 
Tomorrow , we would try again to get into the city . 
At around 8am , Tariq and I drove towards Falluja . 
We did n't believe that we might actually get into the city . 
The American soldiers at the checkpoint were nervous . 
The approach to the checkpoint was covered in pebbles so we had to drive very slowly . 
The soldiers spent 20 minutes searching my car , then they bodysearched Tariq and me . 
They gave me a yellow tape to put on to the windscreen of the car , showing I had been searched and was a contractor . 
If I did n't have this stripe of yellow , a US sniper would shoot me as an enemy car . 
By 10am we were inside the city . 
It was completely devastated , destruction everywhere . 
It looked like a city of ghosts . 
Falluja used to be a modern city ; now there was nothing . 
We spent the day going through the rubble that had been the center of the city ; I did n't see a single building that was functioning . 
The Americans had put a white tape across the roads to stop people wandering into areas that they still were n't allowed to enter . 
I remembered the market from before the war , when you could n't walk through it because of the crowds . 
Now all the shops were marked with a cross , meaning that they had been searched and secured by the US military . 
But the bodies , some of them civilians and some of them insurgents , were still rotting inside . 
There were dead dogs everywhere in this area , lying in the middle of the streets . 
Reports of rabies in Falluja had reached Baghdad , but I needed to find a doctor . 
Fallujans are suspicious of outsiders , so I found it surprising when Nihida Kadhim , a housewife , beckoned me into her home . 
She had just arrived back in the city to check out her house ; the government had told the people three days earlier that they should start going home . 
She called me into her living room . 
On her mirror she pointed to a message that had been written in her lipstick . 
She could n't read English . 
It said : `` Fuck Iraq and every Iraqi in it ! '' 
`` They are insulting me , are n't they ? '' 
I left her and walked towards the cemetery . 
I noticed the dead dogs again . 
I had been told in Baghdad by a friend of mine , Dr Marwan Elawi , that the Baghdad Hospital for Infectious Diseases admits one case of rabies every week . 
The problem is that infected dogs are eating the corpses and spreading the disease . 
As I was walking by the cemetery , I caught the smell of death coming from one of the houses . 
The door was open and the first thing I saw was a white car parked in the driveway and on top of it a launcher for an RPG . 
I went inside , and the sound of the rain on the roof and the darkness inside made me very afraid . 
The door was open , all the windows were broken and there were bullet holes running down the hall to a bathroom at the end - as if the bullets were chasing something or somebody . 
The bathroom led on to a bedroom and I stepped inside and saw the body of a fighter . 
The leg was missing , the hand was missing and the furniture in the house had been destroyed . 
I could n't breathe with the smell . 
I realized that Tariq was n't with me , and I panicked and ran . 
As I got out of the house I saw a white teddy bear lying in the rain , and a green boobytrap bomb . 
Some of the worst fighting took place here in the center of the city , but there was no sign of the 1,200 to 1,600 fighters the Americans said they had killed . 
I had heard that there was a graveyard for the fighters somewhere in the city but people said that most of them had withdrawn from the city after the first week of fighting . 
I needed to find one of the insurgents to tell me the real story of what had happened in the city . 
The Americans had said that there had been a big military victory , but I could n't understand where all the fighters were buried . 
After I saw the body I felt uncomfortable about sleeping in Falluja . 
The place was deserted and polluted with death and all kinds of weapons . 
Imagine sleeping in a place where any of the surrounding houses might have one , two or three bodies . 
We went back to my friend the old Republican guard officer . 
I was so tired I could hardly take my clothes off to go to sleep but I could n't sleep with the smell of death on my clothes . 
In the morning , I went back to find the cemetery and look for evidence of the fighters who had been killed . 
It was about 4pm before I got inside the martyrs ' cemetery ; people kept waylaying me , wanting to show me their destroyed houses and asking why the journalists did n't come and show what the Americans had done to Falluja . 
They were also angry at the interim President Allawi for sending in the mainly Shia National Guard to help the Americans . 
At the entrance to the fighters ' graveyard a sign read : `` This cemetery is being given by the people of Falluja to the heroic martyrs of the battle against the Americans and to the martyrs of the jihadi operations against the Americans , assigned and approved by the Mujahideen Shura council in Falluja . '' 
As I went into the graveyard , the bodies of two young men were arriving . 
The faces were rotting . 
The ambulance driver lifted the bones of one of the hands ; the skin had rotted away . 
`` God is the greatest . 
What kind of times are we living through that we are holding the bones and hands of our brothers ? '' 
Then he began cursing the National Guard , calling them even worse things than the Americans : `` Those bastards , those sons of dogs . '' 
It was n't the first time I had heard this . 
It was the National Guard the Americans used to search the houses ; they were seen by the Fallujans as brutal stooges . 
Most of the volunteers for the National Guard are poor Shias from the south . 
They are jobless and desperate enough to volunteer for a job that makes them assassination targets . 
`` National infidels '' , they were also called . 
I counted the graves : there were 74 . 
The two young men made it 76 . 
The names on the headstones were written in chalk and some had been washed away . 
One read : `` Here lies the heroic Tunisian martyr who died '' , but I did n't see any other evidence of the hundreds of foreign fighters that the US had said were using Falluja as their headquarters . 
People told me there were some Yemenis and Saudis , some volunteers from Tunisia and Egypt , but most of the fighters were Fallujan . 
The US military say they have hundreds of bodies frozen in a potato chip factory 5km south of the city , but nobody has been allowed to go there in the past two months , including the Red Crescent . 
Salman Hashim was crying beside the grave of his son , who had been a fighter in Falluja . 
`` He is 18 years old . 
He wanted to be a doctor or engineer after this year ; it was his last year in high school . '' 
At the same grave , the boy 's mother was crying and remembering her dead son , who was called Ahmed . 
`` I blame Ayad Allawi . 
If I could I would cut his throat into pieces . '' 
Then , to the mound of earth covering her son 's body , she said : `` I told you those fighters would get you killed . '' 
The boy 's father told her to be quiet in front of the camera . 
On the next grave was written the name of a woman called Harbyah . 
She had refused to leave the city for the camps with her family . 
One of her relatives was standing by her grave . 
He said that he found her dead in her bed with at least 20 bullets in her body . 
I saw other rotting bodies that showed no signs of being fighters . 
In one house in the market there were four bodies inside the guest room . 
One of the bodies had its chest and part of its stomach opened , as if the dogs had been eating it . 
The wrists were missing , the flesh of the arm was missing , and parts of the legs . 
I tried to figure out who these four men were . 
It was obvious which houses the fighters were in : they were totally destroyed . 
But in this house there were no bullets in the walls , just four dead men lying curled up beside each other , with bullet holes in the mosquito nets that covered the windows . 
It seemed to me as if they had been asleep and were shot through the windows . 
It is the young men of the family who are usually given the job of staying behind to guard the house . 
This is the way in Iraq - we never leave the house empty . 
The four men were sleeping the way we sleep when we have guests - we roll out the best carpet in the guest room and the men lie down beside each other . 
`` Its Abu Faris 's house . 
I think that the fat dead body belongs to his son , Faris , '' said Abu Salah , whose chip shop was also destroyed in the bombing . 
It was getting dark and it was time to go , but I needed some overview shots of the city . 
There was a half-built tower , so I climbed it and looked around . 
I could n't see a single building that had n't been hit . 
After a few minutes I got the sense that this was n't a good place for me to be hanging around , but I had to pee urgently . 
I found a place on the roof of the building . 
While I was doing that a warning shot passed so close to my head that I ducked and did n't even wait to pull up my zip , but ran to the half-destroyed stairs to climb down the building . 
I felt as if the American sniper was playing with me ; he had had plenty of time to kill me if he wanted to . 
For the rest of the day people were pulling on me to come and see their houses . 
Again , they asked where all the journalists were . 
Why were they not coming to report on what has happened in Falluja ? 
But I have worked with journalists for 18 months and I knew it would be too dangerous for them to come to the city , that they are seen as spies and could end up in a sack . 
So since I was the only one there with a camera , everyone wanted to show me what happened to their house . 
Back in Baghdad that night , I changed my clothes and decided to send them to the public laundry . 
I was worried about contaminating my family with Falluja . 
I was thinking that nobody was going to be able to live there for months . 
Then , I took a very long bath . 
I woke up at home in Baghdad around 9am . 
I had had enough of Falluja , but I still felt that I did n't understand what had happened . 
The city was completely devastated - but where were the bodies of all the dead fighters the Americans had killed ? 
I wanted to ask Dr Adnan Chaichan about the wounded . 
I found him at the main hospital in Falluja at midday . 
He told me that all the doctors and medical staff were locked into the hospital at the beginning of the attack and not allowed out to treat anyone . 
The Iraqi National Guard , acting under US orders , had tied him and all the other doctors up inside the main hospital . 
The US had surrounded the hospital , while the National Guard had seized all their mobile phones and satellite phones , and left them with no way of communicating with the outside world . 
Chaichan seemed angrier with the National Guards than with anyone else . 
He said that the phone lines inside the town were working , so wounded people in Falluja were calling the hospital and crying , and he was trying to give instructions over the phone to the local clinics and the mosques on how to treat the wounds . 
But nobody could get to the main hospital where all the supplies were and people were bleeding to death in the city . 
It was late afternoon when I drove out of Falluja and back to Baghdad , feeling that I had just scratched the surface of what really happened there . 
But it is clear that by completely destroying this Sunni city , with the help of a mostly Shia National Guard , the US military has fanned the seeds of a civil war that is definitely coming . 
If there are elections now and the Shia win , that war is certain . 
The people I spoke to had no plans to vote . 
No one I met in those five days had a ballot paper . 
A week after I arrived in London to make the film for Channel 4 News , the tape of the final interview arrived by Federal Express . 
It was the interview with Alzaim Abu , who had led the fighters in the Shuhada district of Falluja and fought the Americans in the early battles in the city center . 
We had been been trying to track him down for nearly three weeks . 
Then Tariq had got a call from him the night I had left for London saying that he would talk . 
There was a lot of bullshit in the interview ; lots of bravado about how many Americans they had killed and about never surrendering and how Fallujans would win . 
He said that there were a few foreign fighters in the city , but none in his units ; mostly , they were Fallujans . 
But one thing stood out for me that explained the empty graveyard and the lack of bodies . 
He said that most of the fighters had been given orders to abandon the city by November 17 , nine days after the assault began . 
`` The withdrawal of the fighters was carried out following an order by our senior leadership . 
We did not pull out because we did not want to fight . 
We needed to regroup ; it was a tactical move . 
The fighters decided to redeploy to Amiriya and some went to Abu Ghraib , '' he said . 
The US military destroyed Falluja , but simply spread the fighters out around the country . 
They also increased the chance of civil war in Iraq by using their new national guard of Shias to suppress Sunnis . 
Once , when a foreign journalist , an Irish guy , asked me whether I was Shia or Sunni - the way the Irish do because they have that thing about the IRA - I said I was Sushi . 
My father is Sunni and my mother is Shia . 
I never cared about these things . 
Now , after Falluja , it matters .

2005-01-13,"Iraq Survey Group concludes dictator destroyed weapons years before invasion Thursday 13 January 2005 03.10 GMT The US investigators searching for Saddam Hussein 's alleged weapons of mass destruction have given up the hunt and left Iraq with an appeal to the Pentagon for the release of several Iraqi scientists still being questioned , it was reported yesterday . 
Charles Duelfer , who led the Iraq Survey Group , has returned to the US and will deliver a final report in the spring that will be almost identical to the interim assessment he delivered to Congress last October . 
That assessment found Saddam had destroyed his last weapons of mass destruction more than 10 years ago , and his capacity to build new ones had been dwindling for years by the time of the second Gulf war . 
`` Charlie has left Iraq , '' an intelligence official said yesterday . 
`` In terms of the weapons hunt in a proactive sense , it has concluded , and the report is being tweaked a bit but it will be largely unchanged . '' 
But he added : `` There is a considerable amount of document exploitation to be done that will continue to occur and leads that come out of the exploitation will be followed up . '' 
The Washington Post said the ISG had made `` several pleas '' to the Pentagon to release the Iraqi scientists , who have been held for nearly two years and who have been interviewed extensively . 
The scientists include General Amir al-Saadi , who negotiated with UN inspectors on behalf of the Saddam regime ; Rihab Taha , a biologist also known as Dr Germ ; her husband , Amir Rashid , a former oil minister ; and Huda Amash , a biologist nicknamed Mrs Anthrax by UN inspectors . 
Gen Saadi 's German-born wife Helma told the Guardian last night that she had heard from US sources that Donald Rumsfeld , the US defense secretary , had approved her husband 's release some weeks after the October report was submitted . 
He had checked with the Iraqi justice minister who said he had no objection . 
`` I understand the matter is with the prime minister , Ayad Allawi , now . 
I do n't know why it is taking so long , '' she said . 
By chance , the Red Cross arranged yesterday for Gen Saadi to make a rare phone call to his wife . 
`` He did n't sound optimistic , '' she said . 
`` He said he 's kept in the dark . 
No one tells him anything . 
He asked for more books . '' 
Last night the White House press secretary , Scott McClellan , said there no longer was an active search for weapons . 
`` There may be a couple , a few people , that are focused on that , '' he said , `` but it has largely concluded . '' 
He added : `` If they have any reports of -LRB- weapons of mass destruction -RRB- obviously they 'll continue to follow up on those reports . 
`` A lot of their mission is focused elsewhere now . '' 
He said the final Duelfer report `` is not going to fundamentally alter '' the earlier findings , which said Saddam not only had no weapons of mass destruction and had not made any since 1991 , but that he had no capability of making any either . 
Many thousands of pages of Saddam-era documents are still being translated and analyzed , but most weapons experts believe they are unlikely to change the fundamental ISG assessment that the former regime had rid itself of weapons of mass destruction many years before the invasion . 
After Mr Duelfer 's presentation to Congress in October , a senior ISG official said he was only returning to Baghdad `` to tie up odds and ends '' , with no real expectation of further discoveries . 
US officials said the operation was being wrapped up because there was little expectation of finding any substantial new evidence and the hunt could no longer be justified in view of the rising danger to the investigators . 
Despite the end of the search , President George Bush last night said he remained convinced that he was right to go to war on Saddam . 
In an interview with ABC television 's Barbara Walters , Mr Bush admitted : `` I felt like we 'd find weapons of mass destruction , or like many many here in the United States , many around the world , the United Nations , thought he had weapons of mass destruction . '' 
But asked directly whether the invasion of Iraq was worth the cost of an increasingly violent war , Mr Bush said : `` Oh , absolutely . ''

2005-01-14,"Friday 14 January 2005 02.44 GMT The trial of the man labeled by the Pentagon the `` primary torturer '' at Abu Ghraib prison ended abruptly yesterday after the defendant decided at the last minute not to take the stand . 
Specialist Charles Graner , who features prominently in some of the most graphic images from the Iraqi prison , had been expected to argue that he had only been following orders . 
But his defense team said it had made its case in full to the military jury and saw no reason for the soldier to testify . 
`` We came in with a checklist with everything we wanted to present to the jury , '' said his defense attorney Guy Womack . 
`` Once we accomplished that there was no reason to continue . '' 
A verdict is expected as early as today . 
Throughout the proceedings in the small , dark-panelled court room in Fort Hood army base , the burly Graner had been almost ebullient . 
`` I feel fantastic . 
I 'm still smiling , '' he said after proceedings wound down yesterday . 
Asked on the opening day of his trial if he felt any remorse for what went on at Abu Ghraib , the soldier rolled his eyes and smirked . 
If he is found guilty by a jury of 10 soldiers , he could face 17 and a half years in prison for conspiracy , assault , maltreatment of detainees , indecency and dereliction of duty . 
Graner 's last-minute decision yesterday afternoon not to testify must in some ways have arrived as a relief for the Pentagon , removing any threat that the defiant soldier would try to implicate his superiors in the abuse . 
In the Pentagon 's view , the abuse at Abu Ghraib stopped at the enlisted ranks , and Graner was the `` primary torturer '' , a brutal sadist who whistled as he administered beatings - once so hard that he broke a chair over a detainee - and threw prisoners ' rations into the toilet . 
Graner is already linked indelibly in the public mind with the most horrifying images from Abu Ghraib : giving a thumbs up over a pyramid of naked Iraqi detainees , and cajoling his then lover , Private Lynndie England , to pose with a dog leash around the neck of another prisoner . 
Although Graner 's defense put on an air of optimism yesterday , the decision to rest their arguments comes after the judge repeatedly refused their attempts to introduce evidence from use-of-force experts and other testimony to advance their case that piling naked detainees into a human pyramid and other practices were a legitimate form of prisoner control . 
However , the trial did hear for the first time that officers ordered the sexual humiliation of an Iraqi detainee as an interrogation strategy . 
Megan Ambuhl , who it emerged yesterday also had a sexual relationship with Graner , told the court interrogators used female guards to sexually humiliate prisoners . 
`` They asked me to sit in the shower , and to point and laugh at the detainees , '' said Ms Ambuhl , who pleaded guilty last year for her role in the abuse . 
Another guard , Sgt Kenneth Davis , who has not been charged , said : `` I thought the military intelligence was doing some pretty weird things with the detainees . ''

2005-01-15,"Saturday 15 January 2005 00.03 GMT The chaos of Iraq is giving rise to a new generation of `` professional '' terrorists who will eventually replace al-Qaida as a global threat , according to a CIA thinktank . 
A report by the National Intelligence Council says the war in Iraq has provided a training and recruitment ground for Islamist militants , much as Afghanistan did for the founding generation of al-Qaida during the war against the Soviet occupation in the 1980s . 
As new terror organizations emerge on the world stage , al-Qaida will splinter into regional separatist groups , says the report , which forecasts global trends over the next 15 years . 
`` Iraq and other possible conflicts in the future could provide recruitment , training grounds , technical skills and language proficiency for a new class of terrorists who are ` professionalised ' and for whom political violence becomes an end in itself , '' the report says . 
It gives warning that veterans of the conflict in Iraq could disperse around the world , exporting their deadly expertise . 
Specifically , the report warns that the US faces an increasing risk of an attack involving biological agents , such as anthrax , and that an emerging and more sophisticated generation of terrorists could also use chemical weapons . 
The bleak forecast undermines one of the Bush administration 's central justifications for invading Iraq : that it was necessary to curb terrorism ; that the country was a central front in the `` war on terror '' ; and that the deposed Iraqi dictator , Saddam Hussein , had links to al-Qaida 's chief , Osama bin Laden . 
Instead , the report describes how hundreds of foreign terrorists entered Iraq after the US invasion , and how the insurgency against American forces was viewed by radical Muslims as a war against a foreign occupier , akin to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
Terrorists also took advantage of postwar chaos , porous borders and a country awash with weapons . 
But unlike the rise of al-Qaida in Afghanistan , the emerging terrorists do not require a geographical base , and are expected to rely increasingly on the internet . 
`` While taking advantage of sanctuaries around the world to train , terrorists will not need a stationary headquarters to plan and carry out operations , '' the report says . 
`` Training materials , targeting guidance , weapons knowhow and fundraising will increasingly be virtual . '' 
The terrorists now recruited and trained in Iraq will eventually become the successor generation to al-Qaida , it predicts . 
`` Al-Qaida membership that was distinguished by having trained in Afghanistan will gradually dissipate , to be replaced in part by the dispersion of the experienced survivors of the conflict in Iraq . '' 
The 119-page report was based on analysis from more than 1,000 US and foreign observers , and is designed to help the White House track world trends up to 2020 . 
Staff Sergeant Cardenas Alban was sentenced at a court martial yesterday to a year in jail for the murder of a severely wounded Iraqi teenager in a Baghdad slum district during a Shi'ite uprising last year , the US military said .

2005-01-15,"Months of war that ruined centuries of history Cherished monuments defaced and ancient inscribed fragments found in spoil heaps Saturday 15 January 2005 16.18 GMT Iraqi authorities will today take back responsibility for the site of Babylon in a formal handover from the coalition forces . 
But what they will inherit , say experts , is a catalogue of disasters . 
According to the report of the British Museum 's John Curtis , the site has been severely contaminated and parts have been irreparably damaged . 
damage to the dragons decorating the Ishtar Gate , one of the world 's most famous monuments , from attempts to prise out the relief-moulded bricks broken bricks inscribed with the name of Nebuchadnezzar lying in spoil heaps the original brick surface of the great processional route through the gate crushed by military vehicles fuel seeping from tanks into archaeological layers acres of the site levelled , covered with imported gravel - which Dr Curtis said would be impossible to remove without causing further damage - and sprayed with chemicals which are also seeping into the unexcavated buried deposits thousands of tonnes of archaeological material used to fill sandbags and mesh crates , and equally damaging , when that practice stopped , thousands more tonnes of material imported from outside the site , contaminating the site for archaeologists forever . 
Babylon , capital of the Babylonian empire , site of the Tower of Babel and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon , one of the seven wonders of the ancient world , was rediscovered by archaeologists in the 19th century , but has inspired legends for thousands of years . 
It was the capital of two of the most famous kings of all time , Hammurabi , who ruled from 1792 to 1750BC , and introduced the world 's first code of law , and Nebuchadnezzar , ruler from 604 to 562BC , who rebuilt and doubled the size of the city and built the hanging gardens . 
Dr Curtis , head of the Department of the Ancient Near East at the British Museum , has worked as an archaeologist in Iraq for decades , and directed many excavations . 
He was back in Baghdad in 2003 as soon as the bombs stopped falling , when the British Museum led the international effort to assess the damage and losses from the looted national museum . 
He returned to Babylon last month at the invitation of the Iraqi authorities , and inspected it with a team of Iraqi archaeologists . 
However , he was still not able to inspect the entire site , as part of it is still fenced off and mined . 
He therefore warns - in what one archaeologist who has read the report described as `` the killer phrase '' - that his report `` should not be seen as exhaustive , but is indicative of the types of damage caused '' . 
The military camp was established by the American forces in April 2003 , and damage was already visible when Dr Curtis first visited part of the site that June . 
The same contractors , Kellogg , Brown and Root - a subsidiary of the American civil engineering corporation Halliburton , of which the US vice-president , Dick Cheney , is a former chief executive officer - were used to develop and maintain the site throughout , as it grew to a 150-hectare camp , housing 2,000 soldiers . 
This was officially handed over to Polish forces in September 2003 . 
His 14-page report , which includes maps and was compiled during a site visit in December , lists dozens of examples of visible damage . 
In a walk through the ancient city he observes damage to : One of the most famous monuments of antiquity . 
It was excavated in the 19th century by German teams ; the upper glazed parts of the gate are in a Berlin museum . 
However , the monument was so important to the Babylonians that the foundations , deep underground and never visible in antiquity , were also decorated with beautifully modelled dragons and inscriptions . 
He reports 10 separate areas of damage to the moulded brick reliefs . 
`` It has been suggested that most of the damage -LRB- to figures on the gate -RRB- was caused ... by a person or persons trying to remove a decorated brick , '' he says . 
Two 20-metre long trenches have been dug here . 
`` In the piles of spoil alongside the trenches there are many fragments of brick , some with inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar , '' the report says . 
One brick clearly has an inscription which reads : `` Nebuchadnezzar , King of Babylon , who provides for Esagila and Ezadila , the el dest son of Nabopolassar , King of Babylon , am I. '' At one point , outside the base entrance nicknamed the `` Reno Gate '' , he found a 200-metre stretch of road , lined with the mesh baskets `` that have clearly been filled with deposits from the Babylon site , containing sherds , bones , etc. '' Two areas of 6th century BC brick pavement , part of the processional street , are exposed in this area . 
`` In both cases the bricks are badly broken . 
This is thought to be the result of a heavy vehicle or vehicles driving over them . 
If this is so , it is likely that the bricks still covered by earth are similarly damaged . '' 
Trenches have been dug into the ziggurat , one of the stepped pyramids which were one of the most distinctive Babylonian monuments and gave rise to the legend of the Tower of Babel . 
`` Much pottery and many fragments of brick with cuneiform inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar were observed in the bank of spoil '' next to the trench . 
Other observations include : an old car park vastly expanded to make a helicopter landing zone and parking lot , all flattened and gravelled , old tracks covered in new stones , now deeply rutted from heavy vehicles , large areas scooped out to a depth of two metres to obtain material to fill the sand bags and metal baskets and earth mounded up to protect six fuel depots , which also show evidence of leakage . 
The most serious damage may be invisible , the contamination and disturbance of areas which have never been excavated , which may mean that many of the secrets of Babylon , including the site of the hanging gardens , may never be resolved . 
In his conclusions Dr Curtis says : `` A full-scale international investigation should be launched into the damage done to the archaeological site of Babylon during its occupation by coalition forces . '' 
All mines and ordnance must be cleared , and all disturbed areas investigated and recorded by archaeologists appointed by the Iraqis , he says . 
Babylon has never been on the Unesco list of world heritage sites . 
`` Now more than ever Babylon needs the care , attention and advice that being a world heritage site would ensure it received , '' he says . 
Dr Curtis said it was not possible for him to determine at which time , and by which forces , damage was caused : a separate report has been compiled by Polish archaeologists . 
A further report is being compiled by the Iraqis on the damage to Saddam Hussein 's palace , built in a corner of the site , and which had already been looted before allied forces began camping out in the shell . 
The site had such symbolic importance to Saddam that he rebuilt many of the walls and gates , using bricks stamped with his name , many of which have been stolen . 
Dr Curtis , back in his office in the British Museum , refused to say who should pay for the damage , but said : `` The Iraqis simply do not have the resources to tackle the scale of this site , an international effort will clearly be needed . '' 
"
2005-01-15,"Saturday 15 January 2005 16.19 GMT The damage wrought by the construction of an American military base in the ruins of the ancient city of Babylon must rank as one of the most reckless acts of cultural vandalism in recent memory . 
And all the more so because it was unnecessary and avoidable . 
The camp did not have to be established in the city - where the Hanging Gardens , one of the seven wonders of the world , once stood - but given that it was , the US authorities were very aware of the warnings of archaeologists of the historic importance of the site . 
Yet , as a report by Dr John Curtis of the British Museum makes clear , they seem to have ignored the warnings . 
Dr Curtis claimed that in the early days after the war a military presence served a valuable purpose in preventing the site from being looted . 
But that , he said , did not stop `` substantial '' damage being done to the site afterwards not just to individual buildings such as the Ishtar Gate , `` one of the most famous monuments from antiquity '' , but also on an estimated 300,000 square metres which had been flattened and covered in gravel , mostly imported from elsewhere . 
This was done to provide helicopter landing places and parking lots for heavy vehicles that should not have been allowed there in the first place . 
He describes this as `` extremely unfortunate '' from an archaeological point of view since it means previously undisturbed archaeological deposits will now be `` irrevocably contaminated '' , seriously compromising the status of future information on the large areas that have not been excavated -LRB- including , possibly , the remains of the gardens themselves -RRB- . 
The damage was compounded by bringing in sand and earth from elsewhere some of which may have been archaeological deposits in their own right . 
The general situation in Iraq is , of course , overwhelmingly a human and political tragedy but that does not exempt the US authorities , who were in charge until they handed over to Polish soldiers , from the consequences of this act of cultural barbarism carried out in their name by Kellog , Brown and Root , a subsidiary of Haliburton , the company formerly run by US vice president Dick Cheney . 
Babylon is one of the most important archeological sites in the world , situated in an area that has rightly been called the cradle of civilisation to which the origins of so many activities from poetry to engineering can be traced . 
As Dr Curtis reminds us , Babylon itself was ruled by two of the most famous kings of antiquity - Hammurabi -LRB- 1792 to 1750 BC -RRB- who introduced the world 's first law code and Nebuchadnezzar -LRB- 604 to 562 BC -RRB- who built the famed gardens , probably for his wife . 
Babylon is one of the world 's treasures as well as Iraq 's . 
The coalition forces , who officially hand the site back to the Iraqi Ministry of Culture today , have ignored both of these moral responsibilities . 
For Iraq it is also a major potential source of tourism which could play a big part in the eventual reconstruction of the economy . 
During Saddam 's reign of terror what archaeological restorations as there were were mainly done in his image -LRB- with his name also inscribed on many of the bricks -RRB- . 
Saddam also built a palace of his own nearby . 
The job of the archaeologists has been made immeasurably more difficult by the avoidable and philistinian actions of the coalition forces who at the very least ought to pay for the damage they have inflicted . 
No one knows exactly how many more historical treasures lie beneath Babylon . 
That will not be known until a major excavation is undertaken probably as an international effort . 
Meanwhile , the aggravated ruins of the city of stand as a metaphor for the war itself which has left modern Iraq as well as ancient Babylon in a much worse state than they were before the saviors arrived . 
The task of reconstruction can not happen too quickly .

2005-01-15,"US-led forces leave a trail of destruction and contamination in architectural site of world importance Saturday 15 January 2005 16.16 GMT Troops from the US-led force in Iraq have caused widespread damage and severe contamination to the remains of the ancient city of Babylon , according to a damning report released today by the British Museum . 
John Curtis , keeper of the museum 's Ancient Near East department and an authority on Iraq 's many archaeological sites , found `` substantial damage '' on an investigative visit to Babylon last month . 
The ancient city has been used by US and Polish forces as a military depot for the past two years , despite objections from archaeologists . 
`` This is tantamount to establishing a military camp around the Great Pyramid in Egypt or around Stonehenge in Britain , '' says the report , which has been seen by the Guardian . 
Among the damage found by Mr Curtis , who was invited to Babylon by Iraqi antiquities experts , were cracks and gaps where somebody had tried to gouge out the decorated bricks forming the famous dragons of the Ishtar Gate . 
He saw a 2,600-year-old brick pavement crushed by military vehicles , archaeological fragments scattered across the site , and trenches driven into ancient deposits . 
Vast amounts of sand and earth , visibly mixed with archaeological fragments , were gouged from the site to fill thousands of sandbags and metal mesh baskets . 
When this practice was stopped , large quantities of sand and earth were brought in from elsewhere , contaminating the site for future generations of archaeologists . 
Mr Curtis called for an international investigation by archaeologists chosen by the Iraqis to record all the damage done by the occupation forces . 
Last night the US military defended its operations at the site , but said all earth-moving projects had been stopped and it was considering moving troops away to protect the ruins . 
Babylon , a city renowned for its beauty and its splendor 1,000 years before Europe built anything comparable , was chosen as the site for a US military base in April 2003 , just after the invasion of Iraq . 
Military commanders set up their camp in the heart of one of the world 's most important archaeological sites and surrounded the enclosed part of the ancient city . 
At least 2,000 troops were installed , daily passing iconic relics like the enormous basalt Lion of Babylon sculpture . 
In September 2003 the base was passed to a Polish-led force , which held it until today 's formal handover of the site to the Iraqi culture ministry . 
In his report , Mr Curtis accepted that initially the US military presence helped protect the site from looters . 
But he described as `` regrettable '' the decision to set up a base in such an important spot . 
He found that large areas of the site had been covered in gravel brought in from outside , compacted and sometimes chemically treated to provide helipads , car parks and accommodation and storage areas . 
`` The status of future information about these areas will therefore be seriously compromised , '' he said . 
Archaeologists were horrified by the confirmation of reports which have been filtering out of Iraq for months . 
`` Outrage is hardly the word , this is just dreadful , '' said Lord Redesdale , an archaeologist and head of the all-party parliamentary archaeological group . 
`` These are world sites . 
Not only is what the American forces are doing damaging the archaeology of Iraq , it 's actually damaging the cultural heritage of the whole world . '' 
Tim Schadla Hall , reader in public archaeology at the Institute of Archaeology at University College London , said : `` In this case we see an international conflict in which the US has failed to take into account the requirements of the Hague convention ... to protect major archaeological sites - just another convention it seems happy to ignore . '' 
Lieutenant Colonel Steven Boylan , a US military spokes man in Baghdad , said engineering works at the camp were discussed with the head of the Babylon museum . 
`` An archaeologist examined every construction initiative for its impact on historical ruins . '' 
He said plans were being considered to move some of the units in order `` to better preserve the Babylon ruins . '' 
`` The significance of Babylon is not lost on the coalition , '' he added . 
`` The site dates back to the time of Nebuchadnezzar 's Babylon , but there are very few visible original remains to the untrained eye . ''

2005-01-16,"How Condoleezza Rice became the most powerful woman in the world As Condoleezza Rice prepares to take over the US State Department from Colin Powell , Paul Harris investigates the girl from Alabama who has risen to become the Bush family 's ultimate insider Condoleeza Rics puts a high price on loyalty , but the most valuable is certainly her own . 
Her unwavering devotion to President George W Bush will reap its most glittering reward this week when she takes over the State Department , becoming the most powerful black American woman in history and the world 's best-known diplomat . 
Her rise to the top is a remarkable story of superhuman tenacity and single-mindedness . 
At its heart lies an unshakeable belief in her own ability to succeed and a ruthless dedication to advancing herself . 
It is a story of a life that began in the Deep South of a segregated America and has now reached the innermost sanctums of White House politics . 
But it is a story that is only just beginning . 
For Rice 's latest assignment is fraught with danger . 
She is tasked with bringing the State Department firmly in hand , stifling the barely concealed dissent that marked the tenure of Colin Powell . 
It will not be easy and is likely to spark the most fierce bout of Washington infighting in years . 
But for Bush the job is vital . 
The State Department must be brought to heel . 
It is Rice 's job to win that battle for her boss . 
` Can Rice transform the State Department into an obedient tool of the administration ? 
That is the only question in town , ' said Larry Haas , a Washington commentator and former official in the Bill Clinton White House . 
If she does , the Bush administration will at last be a united and monolithic bloc . 
The last whiff of internal dissent will have been snuffed out . 
Rice is in the fight of her life . 
At the same time , Rice is inheriting a complex brief that spans a troubled world . 
The meat grinder of the Iraq war is an ever-present factor . 
Within days of her taking over the job , Iraqis will go the polls in what will either be a vindication of America 's decision to invade or a blood-soaked disaster . 
The threat of Iran and North Korea looms . 
Relations with the United Nations and ` Old Europe ' are tattered and torn . 
Not that Rice is nervous . 
She has been keeping two offices in recent weeks . 
One is deep in the heart of the White House , the other a ` transition office ' on the first floor of the State Department a short stroll away on Washington 's C Street . 
But , starting this week , she will be in ` transition ' no more . 
Friends who met her last week say she is relaxed and affable . 
Her familiar calm demeanor is unruffled by troubles ahead . 
` She was excited , but was the same old person . 
She was relaxed and happy and had a lot of time to chat , ' one friend said . 
That is the Condoleezza Rice way . 
She is like a swan on a lake . 
All poise and grace on the surface , but beneath the water Rice paddles furiously , ruthlessly carving out a place at Bush 's right hand . 
But who is Condoleezza Rice ? 
When she sits down this week before the Senate for the confirmation hearings that will clear her for the job , the panel of aged politicians will see an enigma . 
She has risen to the highest ranks of Washington by being the ultimate insider who has the ear of Bush like no other power player in the capital . 
Yet Rice has remained firmly outside the whirl of Washington life . 
She lives alone and rarely , if ever , socialises on the ` circuit ' . 
She comes from a tradition of academic study rooted in Ivy League universities , yet is a key part of an administration which has openly disdained such elites . 
She is central to one of the most radical Republican governments in recent American history , yet many liberals like her . ' 
I am a flaming liberal , ' laughed one of her friends , ` but she is so bright and intelligent . 
I just think her views are not really represented in this administration . ' 
That is debatable to say the least . 
Rice is undoubtedly deeply conservative , but part of her genius is in persuading many liberals that she secretly might be one of them . 
Rice is also a black American , yet race is rarely if ever mentioned when discussing her rise to power . 
In a race-obsessed society , that is an enigma . 
Perhaps the secret lies in her childhood in the segregated Deep South of Alabama when her home town of Birmingham was marred by racial violence and dubbed ` Bombingham ' . 
For Rice 's family did not embrace the civil rights movement in the way many other Southern blacks did . 
They came from a different tradition which held that simple hard work , discipline and education would bring the American Dream to black America . 
Her family was solidly middle class , with a father who worked as a school guidance counsellor and part-time minister and a mother who was a teacher . 
She was raised intensely as an only child of a couple who came to parenthood late . 
A young Rice performed in church , took piano lessons , learned to play the flute , spoke fluent French and skipped two grades in school . 
Her parents stressed advancement through achievement , not through fighting any racial injustice . 
Despite everything , it would be wrong to say that Rice has little awareness of racial politics . 
` She has no time for black people who are constantly talking about race , but that does not mean she has removed all consciousness of her race , ' said Nicholas Lemann , a writer who has interviewed Rice several times . 
Several anecdotes exemplify Rice 's attitude to her race and also her ferocity when attacked . 
She famously told one interviewer : ` Let me explain to you : I speak French , I play Bach , I 'm better in your culture than you are . ' 
On another occasion , when Rice was an academic at Stanford , she was shopping for expensive jewellery with a friend when a white clerk made some hostile comments . 
` Let 's get one thing straight , ' Rice reportedly told him . 
` You 're behind the counter because you have to work for six dollars an hour . 
I 'm on this side asking to see the good jewellery because I make considerably more . ' 
Rice was a stellar performer at high school , helped by iron discipline that saw her ignore any idea of rebellion or slacking off . 
` If she had children , they would call her ma'am and salute . 
She has a quasi-military approach , ' Lemann said . 
She was certainly a young woman in a hurry to achieve . 
Her family moved to Denver when she was a teenager and she enrolled at the local university at 15 . 
It was there she gave up dreams of becoming a concert pianist and discovered a new passion : international relations . 
That in turn led to an academic career , specialising in the Soviet Union , that eventually brought her into contact with politics and the Bush family . 
When Bush appointed her as his National Security Adviser she was already familiar to him from stays at the Bush family compound in Kennebunkport , Maine . 
From there it has been her incredibly close relationship to Bush that has defined her continued rise . 
She is the paragon of discretion and quiet service to her President . 
` There is little daylight between Rice and Bush . 
It is hard to think of anyone closer to him , ' said Shaun Bowler , a political scientist at the Riverside Campus of the University of California . 
Like Bush , Rice was all transformed by the experience of 11 September , 2001 . 
That day wiped out any remnant of the ` Old School ' Rice who had spent years steeped in academia and the Cold War . 
` Before 9\/11 Rice probably would have been many diplomats ' dream of a Secretary of State , ' said Lemann . 
` After 9\/11 she was transformed into someone tackling a very new world . ' 
Loyalty is now probably what best describes the secret of Rice 's success . 
Not for her the almost public spats with Donald Rumsfeld that marred Powell 's term of office . 
Not for her the secret briefings to the press or the thinly veiled attacks on her colleagues . 
But also not for her the terrible isolation that Powell suffered . 
When it comes to the real decisions over the next four years , Rice will be at the heart of it all . 
She will bring the ideology of the White House right into the State Department . 
That is why she was appointed . 
` Appointing Rice is bringing the White House into State , not bringing State into the White House , ' said Bowler . 
That will antagonise many of the Powellite ` Old Guard ' in the State Department , who long for a world before the war on terror , the invasion of Iraq and the dawn of the neocons . 
It is up to Rice to steamroller that opposition and make her department an effective tool of pushing the Bush doctrine around the world . 
` She has a huge job ahead of her , ' said Haas . 
` State usually has a severe reluctance to ruffle feathers across the globe - but this is clearly a feather-ruffling administration . ' 
So far , however , Rice 's first moves have struck a note of caution . 
Her appointment of the pragmatic Robert Zoellick as her deputy is a traditional move , especially as it passed over the ambitions of the hawkish John Bolton , who would have been the favorite choice of the neocons . 
Surprisingly , Rice has few critics in the American political spectrum . 
Possibly that is because of her achievements , but also perhaps because few people want to be seen to be attacking such a high-profile black woman . 
One critic , however , is Mel Goodman , a former top CIA analyst and author of the book Bush League Diplomacy , which attacks neoconservative foreign policy . 
Goodman said Rice had been a failure at the National Security Council because she was taken by surprise by 11 September . 
` She failed in her job at the NSC . 
It is the story that people refuse to tell , ' he said . 
In a sign that Rice may be headed for troubled waters , Washington insiders are waiting with bated breath for a book by former CIA director George Tenet , who resigned last year as the agency imploded over the scandal of pre-war intelligence on Iraq . 
Goodman said that an initial synopsis of the book indicated who would be firmly in its sights : ` Tenet 's going to go after Condie Rice . ' 
One thing is certain . 
Through all the troubled times ahead , Rice will always appear calm . 
She has good reason to feel safe and secure for she has the unquestioned support of the only man who matters : Bush . 
When last year she referred to Bush as ` my husband ' it was a Freudian slip that reflected how close Rice and the Bush clan have become . 
When it comes to Rice , the little girl from Birmingham who now bestrides the world stage , she really is part of the family . 
I find football so interesting strategically . 
It 's the closest thing to war . 
What you are doing is taking and yielding territory and have certain strategies and tactics . 
My parents had me absolutely convinced that you may not be able to have a hamburger at Woolworth 's , but you can be President of the United States . 
There can not be an absence of moral content in American foreign policy . 
Europeans giggle at this and say we are naive , but we are not European , we are American and we have different principles . 
You were told in segregated Birmingham that if you ran twice as hard , you might get half as far . 
And there were also people willing to run four times as hard so they could stay abreast . 
And once in a while , somebody was willing to run eight times as hard so they could get ahead .

2005-01-19,"Wednesday 19 January 2005 08.47 GMT Photograph no 22 , of a set of 22 , showing Lance Corporal Mark Cooley ` simulating ' a punch to an Iraqi detainee . 
Photograph : British Court Martian Handout\/PA Images of British soldiers described as shocking and appalling that allegedly show the abuse of Iraqi prisoners were shown to a court martial in Germany yesterday as the long-awaited case of three members of the 1st Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers got underway . 
Graphic photographs showing how squaddies forced Iraqis to strip bare and simulate oral and anal sex were put before a panel of seven officers . 
They also saw pictures of a grimacing Iraqi who had been strung up in a cargo net made from thick rope which had been hung from a forklift truck . 
Another showed a soldier , wearing just shorts and flip flops , standing on an Iraqi man who was crouched in a foetal position on the ground . 
The military court in Osnabruck in Germany began hearing the evidence against Corporal Daniel Kenyon , 33 , and lance corporals Darren Larkin , 30 , Mark Cooley , 25 , who face a total of nine charges relating to the alleged abuse of the Iraqis they had taken prisoner two weeks after the conflict was declared over in May 2003 . 
L\/Cpl Larkin has pleaded guilty to a charge of battery but has denied `` disgraceful conduct of an indecent kind '' after he was said have forced two `` unknown males '' to undress in front of others . 
L\/Cpl Cooley has denied two offences involving conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline for simulating punches and kicks to an Iraqi and allowing them to be photographed . 
He also denies disgraceful conduct of a cruel kind after he tied up an Iraqi and hung him from a forklift truck . 
Cpl Kenyon denies all charges , including two of aiding and abetting a person to force two naked detainees to simulate a sex act . 
If found guilty the men face prison sentences and dismissal from the army with disgrace . 
The case has been dubbed `` Britain 's Abu Ghraib '' , coming just one week after an US court martial sentenced one of its soldiers to 10 years for torturing Iraqis . 
US army specialist Charles Graner was accused of stacking naked prisoners in a human pyramid and later ordering them to masturbate while other soldiers took photographs at the prison , near Baghdad . 
Yesterday 's panel was presented with a collection of 22 photographs , taken from the cameras of five soldiers . 
The three accused soldiers had been part of an operation to stop Iraqi looters from stealing humanitarian aid from the British-run camp Bread basket , half a mile west of Basra . 
The court heard that their commanding officer , Major Daniel Taylor , devised a plan , codenamed Operation Ali Baba , aimed at rounding up thieves who had become a major problem at the camp . 
The fusiliers were sent out in groups of four armed with one SA80 assault rifle and camouflage poles to capture Iraqis and bring them back to the camp with the intention of `` working them hard '' to deter looting . 
The court heard such an order was illegal and was in contravention of the Geneva Convention . 
Lieutenant-Colonel Nick Clapham of the army prosecuting authority told the court that while such an order was against the law , `` had these defendants done no more than what that order had envisaged , they would not be facing the charges that they face today '' . 
`` These charges are a long way outside of that order . 
It can not be said that those photographs depict images that are anything other than shocking and appalling . '' 
He said the soldiers had taken the men to their `` hide '' location at the far end of the camp to undertake `` menial tasks '' . 
While there , the unknown Iraqis were forced to undress and perform simulated sexual acts while being photographed . 
One was beaten and suspended from a forklift truck . 
With regard to the pictures depicting sexual acts , he commented : `` I do not say that the act of oral sex is actually taking place . 
It is very close but it has n't got to that stage . '' 
The abused Iraqis pictured never came forward and the allegations only came to light when another fusilier , Gary Bartlam , 20 , took his film to be processed at a shop in his home town of Tamworth . 
Police were called and the soldier was arrested . 
He was recently convicted at a separate court martial , the details of which can not be revealed because of reporting restrictions imposed by Judge Advocate Michael Hunter who is also sitting on the current panel . 
The army 's legal adviser during the war , Lieutenant-Colonel Nicholas Mercer , told the court it had been made `` absolutely clear '' to soldiers that they must `` treat persons who fall into their power humanely and protect them from the dangers of war '' . 
He said that looting in Iraq was `` epidemic and psychotic '' but soldiers had been briefed that prisoners should either be released or handed over to the Royal Military Police as soon as possible . 
The soldiers face a maximum of two years in prison for each of the charges apart from the lesser charge of battery . 
"
2005-01-19,"Wednesday 19 January 2005 00.03 GMT The first British soldier has come forward to urge mass refusal among the ranks to serve in Iraq , saying he would rather go to prison than accept a call-up to war . 
Speaking ahead of a press conference today , Lance Corporal George Solomou , from the London regiment of the Territorial Army , said : `` I am not going to Iraq , point-blank . 
I am a conscientious objector to this war , and I am going to see how the army plays it from there . 
I would rather spend a year in prison than a minute in Iraq as part of an illegal war . '' 
He spoke out as the Ministry of Defense said it was unable to provide details of serious injuries sustained by 790 British troops evacuated since the invasion of Iraq . 
Their injuries were as a result of `` hostile actions , accidents , and other incidents '' , Ivor Caplin , the junior defense minister , told MPs earlier this month . 
Mr Solomou describes an atmosphere of restlessness over Iraq in the increasingly deployed reservist TA , saying : `` I want to act as a beacon for other soldiers to come out and say they are against the war , or at least that they are not prepared to go . 
There are so many more soldiers out there who believe what I believe . 
`` I have always wanted to be a soldier and I still want to be a soldier , '' he added . 
`` But I want to be used in the correct manner . 
We are not just pieces of flesh to be moved about on a chessboard . '' 
Mr Solomou , 38 , a worker for the emergency services in east London , said he had always opposed the war in Iraq , and had marched against it in February 2003 with a group of TA colleagues . 
Citing his objections yesterday , he said : `` I believe the occupation of Iraq to be illegal . 
They have tried everything - weapons of mass destruction , the connection to al-Qaida - none of it was true . 
`` Now the fundamental bedrocks of democracy are being trampled by this war , with the American treatment of prisoners . 
Added to that , the Iraqis can see oil tanker after oil tanker coming out of Iraq while they have n't even got electricity . 
This war is a turning point in history and is about America setting itself on a course to control the world 's petroleum . '' 
Mr Solomou started his TA career as an infantryman , but transferred to the Royal Army Medical Corps attached to the London Irish Rifles . 
He will present his case at a press conference at Westminster today , convened by Military Families Against the War , and led by Rose Gentle from Glasgow , whose 19-year-old son Gordon was killed in Iraq in June last year . 
Most of the 790 injuries sustained by British service personnel since March 2003 were caused by shrapnel , defense sources suggested yesterday . 
The MoD said it could not give any further information . 
It is known that a number have had limbs amputated . 
They include two Royal Signals soldiers who lost their legs in a suicide bomber attack on the Black Watch battlegroup south of Baghdad in November . 
Seveny-three members of the armed forces have been killed in Iraq , more than half the result of accidents and , in at least one case , suicide , according to the latest MoD figures on fatalities . 
Mr Caplin also told MPs earlier this month that there are about 400 British military medical personnel in Iraq , including surgeons , dentists , physiotherapists and mental health specialists . 
In separate parliamentary answers , the Foreign Office minister , Bill Rammell , said the government had `` no reliable of ascertaining the number of Iraqi civilians injured by military or terrorist action '' since May 2003 . 
But he said that according to the Iraqi health minister , figures based on records from some 180 hospitals , showed that between April and October last year 15,517 Iraqi civilians were injured , and 3,853 killed .

2005-01-19,"Wednesday 19 January 2005 14.24 GMT Photograph number nine of a set of 22 showing Lance Corporal Mark Cooley driving a fork lift truck with an Iraqi detainee bound to it . 
Photograph : PA A lawyer for one of the British soldiers facing charges of abusing Iraqi detainees today blamed superiors who had called for a crackdown on looters at a British camp . 
Three Royal Regiment of Fusiliers soldiers are on trial at a court martial this week charged with abusing and sexually humiliating looters they had detained at an aid camp in Basra , southern Iraq , in May 2003 . 
Twenty two photographs of soldiers abusing naked and bound detainees , including images of them being forced to feign sexual acts , prompted outrage after being released by the court last night . 
Today , on the second day of the hearing , a lawyer for the most senior of the accused soldiers , Corporal Daniel Kenyon , 33 , referred to Major Dan Taylor who , the hearing was told yesterday , had launched the crackdown on looters at Camp Bread Basket . 
The major ordered an operation called Ali Baba - a reference to the story Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves - ordering that looters be caught and soldiers `` work them hard '' . 
Today Joseph Giret , Cpl Kenyon 's lawyer , told the hearing : `` He -LRB- Cpl Kenyon -RRB- has not acted out of character . 
The whole reason he is in the dock stems from those who gave the order to operate the Ali Baba plan . '' 
Major Taylor was expected to give evidence to the hearing in Osnabruck , northern Germany , later today . 
Speaking yesterday Lieutenant Colonel Nick Clapham , prosecuting , said Major Taylor 's order was in breach of the Geneva Convention . 
Cpl Kenyon pleaded not guilty yesterday to six charges , including aiding and abetting a person to force two naked detainees to simulate a sex act and failing to report the alleged abuse . 
Today Mr Giret told the panel of seven officers who are trying the soldiers that Cpl Kenyon had been described as a `` war hero '' who had saved soldiers ' lives in the conflict . 
The photographs , taken two weeks after the fall of Saddam Hussein 's regime , prompted comparisons with those showing US troops abusing detainees at Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad which caused international outrage . 
As well as showing forced simulation of sexual acts , some also depict British soldiers allegedly pretending to punch and kick bound men and a prisoner tied to the raised tines of a forklift truck . 
In the Commons this morning , the prime minister , Tony Blair , said that while there was disgust at the `` shocking and appalling '' images , he hoped that the proceedings in Germany would `` indicate we do not tolerate this type of activity in any shape or form '' . 
In Germany , the court has heard that the Ali Baba operation began at daybreak on May 15 2003 with more than 100 British soldiers patrolling the camp in groups of four to six . 
A number of looters were caught and forced to carry back the aid they had stolen . 
They were then broken up into groups and distributed between the servicemen to be `` worked hard '' by carrying out menial tasks at the camp . 
A section run by Cpl Kenyon was given three or four Iraqis to detain and work and a short time later the scenes in the photographs occurred . 
The other men facing court martial are Lance Corporal Darren Larkin , 30 , from Oldham , Greater Manchester , and Lance Corporal Cooley , 25 , from Newcastle upon Tyne . 
L\/Cpl Larkin yesterday admitted one charge of assaulting an unknown male at the camp , but pleaded not guilty to a charge of indecent conduct for allegedly forcing two Iraqi detainees to undress in front of others . 
One of the released photographs shows L\/Cpl Larkin wearing shorts and flip-flops standing on top of a bound Iraqi . 
L\/Cpl Cooley denied three charges , including placing an unknown Iraqi captive on a forklift and also `` simulating '' punching and kicking a detainee while someone else took photographs . 
The court heard yesterday that L\/Cpl Cooley admitted driving the truck but claimed it was `` to move the man out of the sun '' . 
The court heard today that all the accused were briefed on the law of armed conflict and prisoner of war handling , according to army records . 
The army 's senior legal adviser in Iraq , Lieutenant Colonel Nicholas Mercer , told the hearing his orders had made it clear how detainees should be treated . 
He said that the Geneva Convention only allowed photographs of prisoners of war to be taken for the purpose of identification and that photographing civilian detainees had to be `` humane and dignified '' . 
The photographs came to light after a film was taken to be developed at a high street shop in Britain by Fusilier Gary Bartlam , who was convicted of a number of offences in connection with them last week . 
Details of his case can not be fully reported because of reporting restrictions imposed by Judge Advocate Michael Hunter , who is sitting on the hearing 's panel . 
The hearing , which is expected to last up to four weeks , continues .

2005-01-19,"Julia Roberts has a better chance of winning this war Iraq will surrender its soul to America only when the US army has left Wednesday 19 January 2005 00.02 GMT There is growing dissension and dismay in the US armed forces about their prospects of victory in Iraq . 
The yellow ribbons , lapel pins and yard signs expressing solidarity with the nation 's soldiers are still conspicuous around army bases across America . 
But commanders and soldiers alike are conducting an increasingly anguished debate . 
There are four reasons for this . 
First , many service people are shocked by the incontrovertible evidence that the justifications offered by the Bush administration for invading Iraq - WMD and a link with international terrorism - were false . 
Second , bitter and painful fighting , notably in the showpiece assault on Falluja , has failed to suppress insurgency . 
Third , there is deep scepticism about progress in recruiting Iraqis to assume the security burden . 
Even General David Petraeus , the US airborne general charged with organising Iraq 's new forces , is said to be increasingly despondent . 
And finally , the army and marine corps are acutely aware that they have to sustain the occupation without sufficient troops to control the country effectively . 
Having begun the campaign convinced of the justice of their cause and their ability to secure victory , many members of the US military and their families now suspect that the cause may be invalid and the battle unwinnable . 
Last autumn in Iraq , a senior British officer told me how impressed he was by the Americans ' commitment . 
`` Before I came here , '' he said , `` I doubted whether the US army possessed the moral toughness to see this thing through . 
I no longer feel that uncertainty . 
I have not met one American at any level who questions the need to be here , and to finish the job . '' 
That assertion is no longer true . 
In the minds of many US soldiers looms the spectre of Vietnam . 
In recent years , the US army has been forged into a motivated , effective tool for large-scale military operations overseas . 
But it has never been suited to combating insurgency . 
Guerrillas and suicide bombers can impose a deadly corrosion on conventional forces . 
Years ago , I heard an American general 's lament for what was once a formidable cold war fighting machine . 
He said to me : `` We went into Korea ... in 1950 with a very poor army , and came out of it in 1953 with a very good one . 
We went into Vietnam in 1964 with a fine army , and came out in 1975 with a terrible one . '' 
This is the threat that some thoughtful American officers see hanging over the Iraq deployment . 
The US armed forces are fighting the sort of conflict that least suits their capabilities . 
It would be a devastating blow to the confidence painstakingly rebuilt since Vietnam if the US , having committed enormous resources and suffered painful casualties , was obliged to quit Iraq without achieving its purposes . 
Yet would military failure represent decisive defeat ? 
Might not America ultimately prevail in Iraq by means in which armed forces play no part ? 
Consider this proposition from Edward Luttwak , the maverick American strategy guru . 
In a recent speech to a British audience , he suggested that the US began to win the Vietnam war the day after its envoy was humiliatingly evacuated from the roof of the Saigon embassy in April 1975 . 
The military conflict was lost - but , argued Luttwak , the US began to achieve victory culturally and economically . 
Vietnam may still profess a commitment to communism , but in reality capitalism is taking hold at every level . 
American values , represented by corporatism and schools of management studies , are gaining sway over Vietnam as surely as they are every other nation possessed of education and aspirations to prosperity . 
Luttwak describes what is happening as the US acquiring a `` virtual empire '' , founded upon cultural dominance - a convincing proposition , certainly in the eyes of Osama bin Laden , who is attempting to mobilise the Muslim world to resist it . 
Al-Qaida is seeking to combat through terrorism a cultural invasion more effective than stealth bombers and Bradley fighting vehicles . 
Bill Gates and Steven Spielberg represent influences much harder to repel than a field army . 
Luttwak 's remarks raise the fascinating possibility that , while the US might be obliged to abandon its military struggle in Iraq , its values will still triumph . 
Might Baghdad emulate Saigon in surrendering its soul to the US , in a fashion Bin Laden would find repugnant , long after the last American soldier has gone home ? 
I am not arguing that military power is redundant . 
But recent history suggests that America is less skilful in exploiting armed might to fulfil its national purposes than in wielding economic and cultural power , without a soldier in sight . 
Last spring in a refugee camp in Gaza , I was quizzing a cluster of children about what they enjoyed watching on television . 
Without hesitation they cried : `` Rambo ! 
It is hard to think of a less appropriate role model . 
What seemed significant , however , was not the identity of their icon , but its source . 
These children 's parents had come to fear , mistrust and , often , hate America . 
Yet Hollywood possesses a power greater than any that President Bush can exercise through the Pentagon . 
Whatever the political hostility of young Palestinians to the US , they can not escape its cultural ubiquity . 
To return to Iraq : even if the insurgents are successful in forcing the US to abandon its armed struggle , they have much less chance of prevailing against Tom Hanks , Julia Roberts and their kind , who can sustain an occupation of Iraqi homes effortlessly now that satellite TV is almost universally available . 
How fascinating it will be if great armies prove less relevant to the movement of societies in the 21st century than cultural forces . 
We saw a foretaste of this in the last part of the 20th century . 
It was not Ronald Reagan 's rearmament of America that brought the Soviet `` evil empire '' to its knees , but economic failure , and it was the same force that obliged the South African apartheid regime to surrender . 
In the poorest and least educated societies on earth , alas , it is likely that power will continue to be contested at gunpoint . 
But wherever people are susceptible to external cultural influences - and , in fairness to George Bush , `` wherever they are given freedom to receive such influences '' - soldiers are likely to find their relevance diminished . 
I do not think the US armed forces will achieve their military purposes in Iraq . 
The American soldiers who have become pessimistic about the campaign they are waging are probably right . 
But in a long historic view , Microsoft and DreamWorks could achieve a dominance of Baghdad and a power over Iraqi society that eludes George Bush and his armored legions .

2005-01-20,"A leading Iraqi trade unionist , he fought for workers ' rights and opposed the rule of Saddam Hussein , as well as the recent war Thursday 20 January 2005 00.00 GMT Hadi Saleh , international secretary of the Iraqi Federation of Trade Unions -LRB- IFTU -RRB- , who has been murdered aged 55 , was a lifelong fighter for the rights of Iraqi workers to join and form trade unions of their choice and to organise to advance their interests . 
Saleh was born in 1949 , the year after Al-Wathbah -LRB- The Leap -RRB- , the defining event in the birth of Iraq 's organised working class , when railworkers in Baghdad joined students protesting against the Portsmouth Agreement , which gave Britain access to Iraqi airbases and oil revenues . 
Demonstrators chanted `` Long Live the Republic '' and 300 to 400 of them were massacred by police machine guns . 
The monarchy purged the leadership of Iraq 's new civil society movement : on February 14 1949 , Yusuf Salman Yusuf , the general secretary of the Iraqi Communist party , known as Fahd -LRB- the leopard -RRB- , and two politburo members were hanged in a Baghdad square . 
Hanna Batatu , modern Iraq 's greatest historian records : `` Fahd dead proved more potent than Fahd living . 
Communism became now surrounded with the halo of martyrdom . '' 
These two extremes , the promethean leap of the Iraqi workers ' movement and the subsequent martyrdom of Fahd , are present in the hope and tragedy of Hadi Saleh 's life and death . 
Saleh was a printer , his professional life brutally interrupted at the age of 20 by the second Ba'ath coup , when he was sentenced to death for independent labor activities , serving five years on death row before his sentence was commuted . 
He found refuge in Sweden , along with his wife and comrade Korea , with whom he had two children , Furat and Rafid , and where his grandchildren were born . 
There , he helped establish the underground Workers ' Democratic Trade Union Movement -LRB- WDTUM -RRB- in 1980 . 
Known as Abu Furat , Saleh was hunted by the regime : at the WDTUM founding conference in Kurdistan , participants wore scarves concealing their identities . 
Saleh opposed President Bush 's war against Iraq . 
He returned home at considerable personal danger before the collapse of the Saddam Hussein dictatorship and worked tirelessly to end the occupation of his country , by democratic and popular means . 
He saw independent trade unions in Iraq as essential in this task . 
In May 2003 , Saleh and others formed the IFTU , which now represents over 200,000 members in the transportation , printing , construction , oil , electricity , railways and food production industries . 
When a delegation of British trade unionists visited the IFTU in Baghdad , in October 2003 , Saleh told us : `` Saddam Hussein tried for 35 years to suppress trade unions ; he turned his ` yellow unions ' into instruments of repression and violence against workers . 
After the fall of the regime , both nationalist and democratic political traditions within trade unionism have tried to re-establish new trade unions based on democratic principles - not based on one political ideology . '' 
A small-framed , dapper man with an intense gaze and an air of surprising calm , Saleh lived and breathed the history of the workers ' movement , recalling with pride that : `` The printing union in Iraq is considered one of the oldest . 
Historically , its members fought bitter struggles for the right to form their own union , a union that could defend their rights . '' 
In January last year , Saleh visited London , outlining the problems facing Iraqi trade unionists , including the upholding under occupation of Ba'athist - era anti-union laws and attacks by US forces on IFTU offices . 
He told us : `` There is a dire need to organise democratic structures . 
We need new progressive laws that recognize and guarantee workers ' rights , and trade unions need to be involved in the formulation of any new labor laws . '' 
In December , Saleh attended the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions congress in Miyazaki , Japan . 
His gentleness , charm and commitment to democratic , independent workers ' organization impressed all who met him . 
Interviewed about the risks in being a trade unionist , he admitted : `` Yes , it 's -LRB- a risk for -RRB- civil society organizations , including trade unions . 
Extremists who targeted those trade unionists , both teachers and engineers , killed them under the notion that they are collaborating with a state created by the Americans , so by definition those are collaborators and legitimate targets . 
We call on our brothers and sisters in the international community to support us to make sure that our rights in organising formal unions freely and openly are guaranteed and ensured . '' 
Saleh was murdered after being tortured by a gang who broke into his Baghdad home . 
His IFTU comrades described the killing as bearing all the hallmarks of the former security services . 
His union files and membership records were ransacked . 
When the history of Iraq 's labor movement is written , Hadi Saleh 's role will be prominent . 
Those of us who believe in his values must stand in solidarity with his fellow Iraqi trade unionists . 
Hadi Saleh understood that in Iraq , civil society institutions , particularly trade unions , are the key to preventing a repeat of the past . 
That is why he gave his life to the cause of the workers ' movement . 
With the murder of Hadi Saleh , Iraqi working people have lost a courageous trade union leader who dedicated three decades of his life to fighting Saddam Hussein 's dictatorship , to workers ' rights and to the cause of a free , prosperous , democratic and federal Iraq . 
His murder is an attack on the right of Iraqi workers to trade union representation . 
It is aimed at destabilising and undermining the development of trade unions as cornerstones of development and respect for human rights in post-Saddam Iraq . 
In May 2003 , Hadi was instrumental with the WDTUM in organising an open trade union foundation meeting in Baghdad , which led to the formation of the IFTU . 
He was a key political figure , providing mature analysis , an unshakeablebelief in democratic trade union values and boundless energy . 
Hadi Saleh 's commitment to trade unionism was a vital feature of his vision for a democratic , peaceful and federal Iraq , which would unite all Iraqis , regardless of their background , ethnicity or religion . 
For him , trade unions would be the key to achieving such unity . 
Thus he championed workers ' rights to organise and to strike to achieve decent jobs , pay and working conditions : the basic building blocks of strong , non-sectarian trade unionism . 
Such a strategy remains the only way to defeat the IMF shock therapy and trans-national economic occupation , which has been imposed undemocratically on Iraqis by the occupying powers . 
However , his commitment to independent trade unionism was also linked to his determination to end the occupation of our country and to rebuild civil society . 
The IFTU points out that his murder forms part of a continuing program of intimidation against workers and trade unionists . 
Hadi 's IFTU comrades have been heartened in their grief by the response of the international labor movement , the ILO and peace movements across the world to demands that Iraq 's interim government provide adequate protection for workers and their trade union representatives as they carry out their jobs . 
Hadi Saleh , trade unionist and communist , born 1949 ; died January 4 2005 .

2005-01-20,"World fears new Bush era Blair urges more consensual US approach as poll shows unease in 18 out of 21 nations Thursday 20 January 2005 14.33 GMT George Bush will be sworn in as president of the United States for a second term today in a lavish Washington ceremony , amid mounting international concern that his new administration will make the world a more dangerous place . 
A poll of 21 countries published yesterday - reflecting opinion in Africa , Latin America , North America , Asia and Europe - showed that a clear majority have grave fears about the next four years . 
Fifty-eight per cent of the 22,000 who took part in the poll , commissioned by the BBC World Service , said they expected Mr Bush to have a negative impact on peace and security , compared with only 26 % who considered him a positive force . 
The survey also indicated for the first time that dislike of Mr Bush is translating into a dislike of Americans in general . 
Tony Blair , in an interview with the Guardian , expressed hope that Mr Bush 's second term would prove to be more consensual than the first . 
He said there had been an evolution in US policy , witnessed by him in successive conversations with Mr Bush . 
`` Evolution comes from experience , '' he said . 
Mr Blair said that , as part of a learning process that began with the invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001 , the US administration had reached the conclusion that `` in the end , we can take security and military measures against terrorism but ... the best prospect of peaceful coexistence lies in the spread of democracy and human rights '' . 
Asked if Mr Bush had become a multilateralist , Mr Blair said he could not speak for the president but `` it is significant , in my view , that he is coming to Europe as his first foreign visit '' . 
Mr Bush is due in Europe at the end of next month . 
The inauguration is taking place amid unprecedented security in Washington as luminaries from across the country converge on the capital . 
Mr Bush spent the eve of the ceremony to mark the start of his second term shuttling between a series of events : from three candlelit dinners to thank his biggest campaign donors through to a `` Celebration of Freedom '' fireworks concert . 
He described the elections in Afghanistan late last year and in Iraq planned for next week as `` landmark events in the history of liberty '' . 
Mr Bush also proclaimed his inauguration as `` a sign of hope for freedom-loving people everywhere '' . 
Aware of the damage that has been done to America 's reputation over the war in Iraq and the Kyoto protocol on global warming , the new secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , whose appointment was approved by a Senate committee yesterday , promised to try to repair relations with France , Germany and other countries bruised during the first term . 
But yesterday 's poll pointed to the deep suspicion of Mr Bush that exists across the world . 
It found that the bulk of people in 18 of the 21 countries surveyed had negative feelings towards the president . 
Traditional US allies in western Europe were among those expressing the most negative feelings about the re-election . 
In Britain , 64 % of those polled said they disagreed with the proposition that the US would have a mainly positive impact on the world . 
The figures were even higher in France -LRB- 75 % -RRB- and Germany -LRB- 77 % -RRB- . 
Mr Bush 's victory was viewed positively in only three of the 21 countries : the Philippines , Poland and India . 
One of the organisers of the poll , Steven Kull , the director of the Programme on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland , said : `` This is quite a grim picture for the US . '' 
Another of the organisers , Doug Miller , president of the polling firm GlobeScan , said he had been monitoring trends since the start of 2003 and the figure for those who disagreed that the US was having a mainly positive impact on the world had risen from 46 % then to 49 % last year , and had now jumped to 58 % . 
`` Our research makes very clear that the re-election of President Bush has further isolated America from the world , '' he said . 
`` It also supports the view of some Americans that unless his administration changes its approach to world affairs in its second term , it will continue to erode America 's good name , and hence its ability to effectively influence world affairs . '' 
Asked how Mr Bush 's re-election had affected their feelings towards Americans , 72 % of those polled in Turkey said it made them feel worse about Americans , 65 % in France , 59 % in Brazil and 56 % in Germany . 
There was also overwhelming opposition to sending troops to Iraq , even among close allies such as Britain . 
`` Fully one in four British citizens say the Bush re-election has made them more opposed to sending troops to Iraq , resulting in a total of 63 % now opposed , '' Mr Miller said . 
The poll was conducted between November 15 and January 3 in Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , Chile , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Lebanon , Mexico , Philippines , Poland , Russia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey and the UK . 
A separate poll , for the Los Angeles Times , shows Americans are also polarised over the prospect of a second term , including over the conduct of the war in Iraq . 
Mr Bush 's job approval rating stands at 50 % , with 47 % disapproving . 
In recent times , only Richard Nixon at the start of his second term in 1972 recorded poll ratings as poor .

2005-01-21,"Care , confrontation and compromise are essential weapons Friday 21 January 2005 00.05 GMT For Britain 's 1.6 m Muslims , generalisations are deceptive . 
Lumping together wealthy Arabs in west London , poor Punjabis in Birmingham , Bangladeshis from rural Sylhet in Tower Hamlets and middle class Indian Muslims in Leicester , can obscure more than it illuminates , and many familiar problems -LRB- like high unemployment , poor housing and discrimination -RRB- and now mixed in with many less familiar advances -LRB- for example in school results or political clout -RRB- . 
But one issue hangs over every British Muslim : the sincerely held belief of millions of people that a war is now underway between Islam and the west . 
They include belligerent American Christian republicans ; secular European liberals who see Islam as uniquely intolerant , violent and dogmatic -LRB- and Turkey as a mortal threat to the EU -RRB- , and Islamic activists who interpret every event from Chechnya to Iraq as further evidence of a western conspiracy to destroy Islam . 
To the extent that these beliefs gain further ground , we risk a bleak future of further segregation , mistrust and misunderstanding . 
But it 's important to remember that we have been here before . 
England 's Catholics were widely seen as a fifth column 180 years ago . 
They were allied to our historic enemy -LRB- and France was a far more serious threat than al-Qaida will ever be -RRB- . 
They answered to a foreign Pope and , as the public were constantly reminded by ranting Protestant priests , Catholicism threatened our most cherished values of liberty and democracy . 
Yet the clash of civilisations never happened . 
Within a few decades Catholics were being successfully integrated . 
The worst legal discrimination had been removed and the earlier anxieties had come to seem faintly absurd . 
This example confirms the wider lesson of history . 
Conflicts are never caused in any simple way by identity , culture or economics . 
Where resources are scarce , or there are strong historical memories of conflict , small events are more likely to inflame passions . 
But all over the world many communities that might be expected to be divided live happily together , just as many communities that were previously integrated -LRB- like in Yugoslavia , India or Rwanda -RRB- have descended into bitter hatreds . 
What makes the difference ? 
Dealing with underlying structural problems helps , but not as much as how people and institutions behave : whether communities turn a blind eye to provocations ; whether intellectuals and journalists allow lies to take root ; whether leaders whip small resentments into big ones ; whether states respond with sensitivity or crude force . 
For Britain , three conclusions follow . 
First , leaders and institutions need to take great care over what they say and do , whether they are mullahs or ministers . 
One example illustrates the point . 
The wrongful arrest of tens of thousands of British Muslims after the September 11 attacks can be explained by the very poor intelligence the police had , and , just possibly , excused by the fact that a terrorist action in Britain linked to British Muslims would have been hugely damaging . 
But responsible leadership in a diverse society has to mean thinking through all of the possible effects of actions . 
Second , we need to fight the myths on all sides . 
Secular commentators should be challenged when they claim that Islam is uniquely violent -LRB- what about the horrors committed in the name of Christianity , secular communism or for that matter Hinduism -RRB- . 
They should be challenged when they paint Islam as uniquely intolerant -LRB- what of the Emperor Akbar who remains the world 's best example of active rather than passive tolerance -RRB- or as bound to subordinate civil life to religion -LRB- what about Turkish or Ottoman history -RRB- . 
Equally , Salafi extremists operating within Muslim communities should be challenged when they propagate lies about American or Zionist conspiracies . 
They should also be confronted when they exploit real grievances over Palestine but ignore the complexities of Kosovo or Bosnia -LRB- when the west came to the aid of a Muslim minority being oppressed by a Christian majority -RRB- , or the inconvenient fact that the worst slaughter of Muslims of recent years -LRB- in the Iran\/Iraq war -RRB- was at the hands of other Muslims . 
Third , we need new deals to be negotiated ; compromises which allow life to go on and hold resentments at bay . 
Some of those implicit deals are already taking shape : more autonomy to run Islamic schools in return for a commitment to the national curriculum so that children are prepared for life in modern Britain ; more targeted social programs ; more chances for young Muslims -LRB- and their often equally isolated white working class counterparts -RRB- to mix with others . 
Some of these deals may be uncomfortable when they touch on such issues as the non-negotiability of free speech , the possibility of a limited role for sharia law , or a stronger emphasis on English language skills . 
The point is that these all have to be talked about and negotiated politically , not treated as matters of absolute and immovable principle . 
Societies can easily talk themselves into conflict and misery . 
But they can also talk , and act , their way out .

2005-01-22,"The dangers of exporting democracy Bush 's crusade is based on a dangerous illusion and will fail Saturday 22 January 2005 12.22 GMT Although President Bush 's uncompromising second inaugural address does not so much as mention the words Iraq , Afghanistan and the war on terror , he and his supporters continue to engage in a planned reordering of the world . 
The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are but one part of a supposedly universal effort to create world order by `` spreading democracy '' . 
This idea is not merely quixotic - it is dangerous . 
The rhetoric implies that democracy is applicable in a standardised -LRB- western -RRB- form , that it can succeed everywhere , that it can remedy today 's transnational dilemmas , and that it can bring peace , rather than sow disorder . 
Democracy is rightly popular . 
In 1647 , the English Levellers broadcast the powerful idea that `` all government is in the free consent of the people '' . 
They meant votes for all . 
Of course , universal suffrage does not guarantee any particular political result , and elections can not even ensure their own perpetuation - witness the Weimar Republic . 
Electoral democracy is also unlikely to produce outcomes convenient to hegemonic or imperial powers . 
-LRB- If the Iraq war had depended on the freely expressed consent of `` the world community '' , it would not have happened -RRB- . 
But these uncertainties do not diminish its justified appeal . 
Other factors besides democracy 's popularity explain the dangerous belief that its propagation by armies might actually be feasible . 
Globalisation suggests that human affairs are evolving toward a universal pattern . 
If gas stations , iPods , and computer geeks are the same worldwide , why not political institutions ? 
This view underrates the world 's complexity . 
The relapse into bloodshed and anarchy that has occurred so visibly in much of the world has also made the idea of spreading a new order more attractive . 
The Balkans seemed to show that areas of turmoil required the intervention , military if need be , of strong and stable states . 
In the absence of effective international governance , some humanitarians are still ready to support a world order imposed by US power . 
But one should always be suspicious when military powers claim to be doing weaker states favors by occupying them . 
Another factor may be the most important : the US has been ready with the necessary combination of megalomania and messianism , derived from its revolutionary origins . 
Today 's US is unchallengeable in its techno-military supremacy , convinced of the superiority of its social system , and , since 1989 , no longer reminded - as even the greatest conquering empires always had been - that its material power has limits . 
Like President Wilson , today 's ideologues see a model society already at work in the US : a combination of law , liberal freedoms , competitive private enterprise and regular , contested elections with universal suffrage . 
All that remains is to remake the world in the image of this `` free society '' . 
This idea is dangerous whistling in the dark . 
Although great power action may have morally or politically desirable consequences , identifying with it is perilous because the logic and methods of state action are not those of universal rights . 
All established states put their own interests first . 
If they have the power , and the end is considered sufficiently vital , states justify the means of achieving it - particularly when they think God is on their side . 
Both good and evil empires have produced the barbarisation of our era , to which the `` war against terror '' has now contributed . 
While threatening the integrity of universal values , the campaign to spread democracy will not succeed . 
The 20th century demonstrated that states could not simply remake the world or abbreviate historical transformations . 
Nor can they easily effect social change by transferring institutions across borders . 
The conditions for effective democratic government are rare : an existing state enjoying legitimacy , consent and the ability to mediate conflicts between domestic groups . 
Without such consensus , there is no single sovereign people and therefore no legitimacy for arithmetical majorities . 
When this consensus is absent , democracy has been suspended -LRB- as is the case in Northern Ireland -RRB- , the state has split -LRB- as in Czechoslovakia -RRB- , or society has descended into permanent civil war -LRB- as in Sri Lanka -RRB- . 
`` Spreading democracy '' aggravated ethnic conflict and produced the disintegration of states in multinational and multicommunal regions after both 1918 and 1989 . 
The effort to spread standardised western democracy also suffers a fundamental paradox . 
A growing part of human life now occurs beyond the influence of voters - in transnational public and private entities that have no electorates . 
And electoral democracy can not function effectively outside political units such as nation-states . 
The powerful states are therefore trying to spread a system that even they find inadequate to meet today 's challenges . 
Europe proves the point . 
A body such as the European Union could develop into a powerful and effective structure precisely because it has no electorate other than a small number of member governments . 
The EU would be nowhere without its `` democratic deficit '' , and there can be no legitimacy for its parliament , for there is no `` European people '' . 
Unsurprisingly , problems arose as soon as the EU moved beyond negotiations between governments and became the subject of democratic campaigning in the member states . 
The effort to spread democracy is also dangerous in a more indirect way : it conveys to those who do not enjoy this form of government the illusion that it actually governs those who do . 
We now know something about how the actual decisions to go to war in Iraq were taken in at least two states of unquestionable democratic bona fides : the US and the UK . 
Other than creating complex problems of deceit and concealment , electoral democracy and representative assemblies had little to do with that process . 
Decisions were taken among small groups of people in private , not very different from the way they would have been taken in non-democratic countries . 
Fortunately , media independence could not be so easily circumvented in the UK . 
But it is not electoral democracy that necessarily ensures effective freedom of the press , citizen rights and an independent judiciary .

2005-01-23,"Lawyers weigh charges over nine fresh allegations as government faces demands for full public inquiry The army faces a fresh series of serious allegations of abuse against its forces in Iraq , The Observer has learned . 
The Ministry of Defense confirmed last night that army prosecution lawyers have completed investigations into nine separate incidents involving British soldiers serving in Iraq and are now actively considering bringing charges on the back of their inquiries . 
Three of the cases concern incidents in which Iraqis were detained by British forces . 
Four involve the fatal shooting of Iraqis during military operations and two involve non-fatal injuries . 
A further 48 cases are still being investigated , while 77 cases have been examined and closed by army lawyers . 
An MoD spokesman declined to give further details , but confirmed : ` Nine cases are now complete and the army prosecution authorities are examining them . ' 
The nine cases are in addition to the current court mar tial in Osnabrck , Germany , where three members of the Royal Fusiliers have been accused of abusing Iraqi civilians . 
The revelation that more of the 9,200 soldiers serving in Iraq could face courts martial has prompted calls from human rights groups for a full public inquiry into the army 's activities . 
They also want to know when - and to what extent - the government was aware of concerns about the abuse of Iraqis . 
Kate Allen , director of Amnesty International UK , which last year raised concerns about the conduct of British troops with defense ministers , said only an independent investigation could reveal the true picture . 
Referring to the court martial in Osnabrck , Allen said : ` What 's really staggering is that these allegations would probably never have come to light had a soldier not taken some pictures into a high street developers ' and the staff not called the police . 
Is that really the full extent of public scrutiny over the behavior of our armed forces ? ' 
Allen said it was not enough for the government to rely on the army 's own inquiries into allegations of mistreatment of Iraqis civilians and soldiers . 
` Complaints against the armed forces are investigated behind closed doors , by the armed forces themselves . 
The decision whether to pursue a case rests with the commanding officer of the accused - hardly the independent and impartial investigation that international law requires , ' Allen added . 
Phil Shiner , of Birmingham-based Public Interest Lawyers , who is representing Iraqi civilians in some 40 legal actions against the army , 10 of which involve allegations of detention and mistreatment , said he had written to the attorney-general expressing concerns that allegations of abuse might be more widespread than previously acknowledged . 
Whatever the outcome of the army 's investigation into the nine pending investigations , more soldiers will appear before courts martial this year , threatening further negative publicity for defense chiefs who have already seen recruitment levels drop . 
Trooper Kevin Williams , of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment , will appear before a court martial charged with shooting dead an Iraqi civilian , while Private Alexander Johnston , of the Kings Own Scottish Borderers , is to face trial accused of the unlawful wounding of a 13-year-old boy . 
A number of Territorial Army soldiers who served with the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment are also to face a court martial over charges that they faked photographs of Iraqi soldiers being abused , which were subsequently sold to the Mirror newspaper . 
Yesterday it emerged that it was not only British and US forces that are battling abuse charges . 
A female intelligence officer and four military police sergeants from Denmark are to face a court martial accused of mistreating Iraqi prisoners . 
The abuse is alleged to have occurred last year , when the five were stationed near Basra as part of a 500-strong contingent sent to Iraq . 
"
2005-01-24,"Monday 24 January 2005 02.16 GMT Plagued by mission fatigue , casualties and a public starting to ask just how long the US plans to keep its soldiers in Iraq , the American army may have come up with a solution : robots . 
From March or April this year , it plans to deploy 18 armed robots to Iraq to help fight the `` war on terror '' . 
Although the robots have a snappy name - Swords , or Special Weapons Observation Reconnaissance Detection Systems - they are n't quite the sleek , cold-blooded androids of I , Robot . 
Rather , they look more like the sort of contraption dreamt up for the program Robot Wars . 
The Swords are essentially modified bomb disposal robots of the sort commonly deployed in Northern Ireland and Iraq , where they have been successfully used to defuse roadside bombs . 
Mounted on tracks , they have a standard army-issue automatic weapon bolted on top , capable of firing between 300 and 350 rounds a minute . 
The firing is done by a human soldier via a video camera . 
`` It 's important to stress that not everything has to be super hi-tech , '' Anthony Sebasto , an official at Picatinny Arsenal in New Jersey , which helped develop it , told Associated Press . 
Developed at a cost of $ 2m -LRB- # 1.07 m -RRB- , Swords have certain advantages over the traditional human fighting unit . 
They are cheap and require no food ; they can be packed away between campaigns ; they are unlikely - barring modifications - to write anguished letters home to loved ones or the media . 
They are also a much better shot than the average GI . 
But there are downsides : each robot has a top speed of 4mph and can only operate for one to four hours before it needs to refuel . 
Swords , made by a small company in Massachusetts , are the first in a new generation of gizmos to go to war . 
Coming soon is the Future Combat System from Lockheed Martin , which includes a six-wheel , 2.5-tonne vehicle . 
The Pentagon 's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is backing research into robots that can be dropped into combat zones from aircraft .

2005-01-24,"Since the war , life has badly deteriorated for women in Iraq and girls are being forced to wear the veil again . 
Rory McCarthy meets those determined to fight back A workman is pinning a banner to the wall as a chill draft swirls through the near-empty ballroom at the Palestine hotel . 
`` An equal , secular constitution is the first step to total fairness , '' the sign says in Arabic . 
This is supposed to be one in a series of pioneering public meetings to address the growing inequalities of women in the new Iraq . 
A year ago , in the weeks after the invasion , hundreds of women marched in the streets outside this hotel in central Baghdad . 
The women were optimistic , most walked without veils and they made forceful speeches in front of the TV cameras . 
Those days of mass protest are over . 
Today there are barely a dozen women present . 
Half are veiled and most have come with male relatives or colleagues for protection . 
It is a quiet indictment of the occupation and underscores the astonishing collapse in security , particularly for women , that it has brought . 
`` Do you feel how threatening it is to go out in the streets ? 
Can you guarantee that you are safe and alive by the end of the day ? '' 
asks Yanar Mohammad , the conference organiser and one of the most ardent women 's rights activists in Iraq . 
`` It is the insecurity that handicaps the organising of woman . '' 
The few women there describe how things have changed for them since the fall of Saddam Hussein and the subsequent rise in Islamic parties . 
Many more cover their hair now , sometimes in belief , often through peer-group pressure or simply to protect themselves in anonymity . 
`` Veils are imposed on young girls , '' says Nadam Moaeed . 
`` What do girls understand from this veil ? 
It will have a bad psychological effect . 
She will become a negative presence in society . '' 
She describes the new pressures on children in schools and the pervasive influence of the religious parties , particularly the conservative Shia groups , which are certain to dominate the new parliament after this weekend 's elections . 
`` Political parties come and take a room in the school building and they impose on every female student veils and even gloves , '' she says . 
`` Where is the humanity in that ? 
They are always putting up Islamic pictures in the school and the children do n't understand it at all . 
We heard of one school where Christian girls were made to wear the veil . '' 
Thiqra Faisal , a student , has traveled up from Basra , a city regarded as more liberal than most . 
`` Even in the universities , women ca n't wear what they want , '' she says . 
`` If you see a woman without a scarf in the street , everyone will be surprised . 
You have to be fully covered . '' 
It was not always this way . 
In the 1950s , Iraq was the first Arab country to appoint a female government minister . 
Women worked freely in banks and government and administrative departments and were involved in a vibrant public debate . 
The changes came in the 1990s when Saddam Hussein began to appease the tribes and the imams . 
He allowed men to take four wives and ruled there would no longer be any punishment for a man who killed a woman in his family if he suspected her of an `` honor crime '' . 
These conservative rulings have been inherited and tacitly endorsed by the major religious parties . 
At one stage a year ago , hardliners in the US-appointed governing council tried to pass article 137 that would impose Islamic Sharia law over rights of personal status , drastically diluting the legal protection for women . 
After a series of vocal protests the article was dropped , but it was a clear warning of the conservative political program that lies ahead . 
These are the public problems . 
In private there is so much more that remains unspoken . 
The conference organiser Mohammad , 44 , runs the Organisation for Women 's Freedom in Iraq , an outspoken campaigning movement . 
She is rare among Iraqi women : avowedly secular and unafraid to stand up in public and pugnaciously condemn the failings of the male-dominated establishment . 
She dresses as she might in the west - today she is wearing a smart trouser suit and her long dark hair is , as always , uncovered . 
Her views are so radical in today 's Iraq that she has twice had death threats , always travels with a guard and has a small silver pistol hidden in her purse . 
Her group has already established two women 's shelters - in Baghdad and Kirkuk . 
In the past year perhaps a dozen women have been taken in and many more have asked for help , telling stories of brutality and oppression rarely acknowledged in public . 
They found one woman from a strict Islamic family in the Kurdish north who had been raped before she was married . 
`` After her husband found out he decided she was filthy and not allowed to touch her newborn child . 
It was bad , daily beatings . 
We found her on the street weeping , '' says Mohammad . 
Now the woman , 23 , is back at school , living in the shelter and planning to go to university . 
The group 's campaigning and shelters is largely down to the energy of Mohammad herself . 
An architecture graduate from Baghdad University , she lived abroad for 10 years before the war , mostly in Toronto . 
There she met socialist feminists and decided to return to Iraq to campaign after the fall of the regime . 
She sold her house and left her husband and 17-year-old son behind in Canada . 
`` I became obsessed with the shelter . 
It had to be done , '' she says . 
Now , a year on , she is worried that many people 's frustration at the failures of the occupation are being channeled into hardline Islamic movements . 
`` The liberation should happen through a civil and secular alternative . '' 
She makes her case in an unrepentant way . 
The latest copy of her group 's newspaper , al-Musawat , or Equality , shows a photo of her burning a veil . 
`` They should be afraid of us , '' she writes . 
She refuses to take part in the elections this Sunday , even though rules are in place to ensure that each party includes 25 % women among its candidates . 
She argues that the overwhelming influence of the Islamists has unfairly tipped the balance and says her group would be unlikely to win a seat . 
Instead she will continue campaigning from outside government . 
`` There are thousands of secular people supporting me . 
With short , certain steps we will get somewhere , '' she says . 
`` But it will take time . ''

2005-01-26,"Wednesday 26 January 2005 17.05 GMT US CH-53 Sea Stallion helicopters of the type that crashed in Iraq today . 
Photograph : Charles Whitehouse\/AP Thirty-one US marines were killed today when the helicopter they were traveling in crashed in the desert in western Iraq , causing the largest loss of life among US forces in a single incident since the beginning of the Iraq war . 
The helicopter went down near Rutba , about 220 miles west of Baghdad , while conducting security operations , the military said in a statement . 
A Pentagon source said the helicopter was a CH-53 Sea Stallion , which normally carries 37 passengers , but can take up to 55 . 
It was not immediately known how many people were on board , nor whether it was shot down or crashed in an accident . 
The aircraft was transporting personnel from the 1st Marine Division . 
A search and rescue team has reached the site and an investigation into what caused the crash is underway . 
The US president , George Bush , expressed his sorrow at the news at the first White House press conference of his new term . 
`` Obviously , any time we lose life , it is a sad moment , '' he said . 
Asked about the cause of the crash , Mr Bush said , `` I 've heard rumors , but let 's wait for the facts '' . 
The US military has lost at least 33 helicopters since the war began in March 2003 , according to the Brookings Institution . 
At least 20 were brought down by hostile fire . 
The previous most deadly incident involving US troops was on November 15 2003 , when two Black Hawk helicopters collided in Mosul while trying to avoid ground fire , killing 17 soldiers . 
Last month , a suicide bomb explosion at a mess tent in a base near Mosul killed 22 people including 14 US soldiers and three US contractors . 
The Iraqi government announced today that it would ban travel between provinces and extend the hours of a curfew as part of security measures for this weekend 's election . 
Falah al-Naqib , the Iraqi interior minister , said the curfew - currently 8pm to 6am - would begin an hour earlier at 7pm . 
It would be enforced from Friday until Monday , the day after voting . 
During that period , only vehicles with special permits would be allowed to travel between Iraq 's 18 provinces . 
Baghdad international airport is to be closed and the nation 's borders sealed during the election period . 
Weapons will be banned and rewards given to Iraqis who turn in `` terrorists '' . 
Mr Naqib also announced the arrest of an alleged aide to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , al-Qaida 's purported leader in Iraq . 
Khamees Mohsen al-Egaily , was said to have been involved in explosions and murders . 
Militants continued their campaign of violence today , attacking US forces , schools to be used as polling stations , and political party offices . 
Three car bombs exploded in Riyadh , around 40 miles south-west of Kirkuk , killing at least five people , including three policemen . 
One of the bombs targeted a US convoy , but there were no reports of casualties . 
The others targeted a police station and the mayor 's office . 
Four US soldiers were injured in a car bombing in Saddam Hussein 's hometown , Tikrit , the US military said . 
Witnesses also reported a US convoy being attacked near Baghdad airport , with at least one vehicle being destroyed . 
In the Sadr City area of Baghdad , Iraqi forces , backed by US troops , raided a Shia mosque overnight , detaining up to 25 followers of the radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr , police and the cleric 's supporters said . 
Insurgents fired on the Baquba offices of the Communist party , the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the United Iraqi Gathering , with one traffic policeman being killed , police said . 
Residents of Ramadi , west of Baghdad , reported clashes between US troops and rebels when a US patrol came under attack from rocket-propelled grenades . 
One Iraqi was killed and two wounded , a Ramadi general hospital doctor said . 
In Mosul , insurgents released a video recording , seen by Reuters correspondents , apparently showing three Iraqi captives with weapons pointed at them , saying they worked for the Iraqi electoral commission . 
Two militants appeared on the video without the hostages . 
One read a statement , saying : `` We are mujahideen in the province of Nineveh . 
What they call elections have no basis in the Islamic religion and that 's why we will hit all election centres . '' 
The militants did not threaten to kill the election workers . 
The election will be Iraq 's first multi-party poll in half a century . 
Voters will elect a 275-member assembly that will pick Iraq 's new transitional government and draft a permanent constitution . 
The prime minister , Tony Blair , today indicated that Britain and the US could begin handing over large parts of Iraq to the country 's security forces after the election . 
Mr Blair told the Financial Times that Washington and London were set to agree `` timelines '' with the new government indicating the pace at which Iraqi forces could take over less difficult areas . 
`` Both ourselves and the Iraqis want us to leave as soon as possible . 
The question is , what is as soon as possible ? 
And the answer is when the Iraqi forces have the capability to do the job , '' he said . 
`` There are areas where we would be able to hand over to those Iraqi forces . 
Remember , 14 out of the 18 provinces in Iraq are relatively peaceful and stable . ''

2005-01-27,"Arab leaders watch in fear as Shia emancipation draws near Thursday 27 January 2005 00.02 GMT For the first time in centuries , Shias are about to come into their own as the rulers - or at least the politically dominant community - in a key Arab country . 
In principle , the Iraqi elections will ratify and lend constitutional legitimacy to a transformation inexorably under way since the fall of Saddam Hussein . 
In the Arab world , except for Lebanon with its largely Christian population , the rulers of all 22 states have traditionally hailed from the orthodox Sunni majority . 
But until now that has included two countries , Iraq and Bahrain , where , against the broader trend , Shias compose the majority . 
The correction of this anomaly will be momentous , given Iraq 's history and geopolitical weight , and the tumultuous conditions in which it is taking place . 
Iraq , after all , is where , in the bloody struggle over the prophet 's succession , Islam 's great schism first took root ; where , for centuries , Shias under Sunni Ottoman rule bore the brunt of its conflicts with Shia Persian empires ; where , in the 1920s , Shias led the rebellion against British mandatory rule , but ended up grossly underrepresented in the modern Iraqi state ; where , under Ba'athism , Sunnis turned minority rule into despotism of the most chauvinistic and brutal kind . 
The idea of electorally established Shia dominance of Iraq deeply troubles Arab regimes , with or without Shias of their own . 
Jordan 's King Abdullah has most publicly declared what others keep to themselves . 
For him the great peril is Iran , the world 's only -LRB- apart from Azerbaijan -RRB- Shia-majority state that is also Shia-ruled - and clerically , militantly ruled to boot . 
Iran 's `` vested interest '' , he says , is `` to have an Islamic republic of Iraq ; if that happened , we 've opened ourselves to a whole set of new problems that wo n't be limited to the borders of Iraq '' . 
He warned of a Shia `` crescent '' stretching from Iran into Iraq , Syria and Lebanon , destabilising Gulf countries and posing a challenge to the US . 
`` This is the first time , '' said the Lebanese commentator Joseph Samaha , `` an Arab official has used such crude , direct and dangerous language to publicly incite against a particular confession and warn that it may turn into a fifth column to be used against the majority . '' 
For other Arab commentators , what such remarks indicate , at bottom , is fear of democracy , and the prospect that Iraq will now demonstrate what Palestine already has - that in the Arab world people have more electoral choice if they are occupied rather than sovereign . 
`` They are terrified , '' said Salama Ne ` mat , `` lest elections prove contagious and spread to Iraq 's neighbouring states and peoples . 
`` The danger to certain Arab governments is the democratic ` weapon of mass destruction ' that could destroy the structure of tyranny and backwardness that weighs heavily upon the chests of their peoples . '' 
Any Iraqi democracy is bound , at first , to assume the `` sectarian '' character King Abdullah deplores . 
The ruthless , discriminatory exploitation of sectarianism that was the foundation of Saddam 's rule has to give way to a system whose primary building block is the fair and representative stake which the country 's various communities acquire in it , the Shias acquiring the largest . 
Inevitably , too , Iran , for which the emancipation of its Iraqi co-religionists is a great potential enhancement of its own regional influence , is Iraq 's only neighbor to be happy about that . 
Ironically , it was much quicker than Arab friends of America to `` recognize '' the new American-installed Iraqi order and is the most ardent supporter of American-sponsored elections . 
Arab regimes with Shia citizens , especially in the Gulf , perhaps have most grounds for alarm , because , like Saddam , they have in varying degrees discriminated against them . 
The quest for equal rights has been common to Shias in every modern Arab state . 
The only one in which they have basically achieved them , through civil war as well as that country 's unique , confessionally organised political system , is Lebanon . 
`` Iraq could represent a democratic model for the Arab-Muslim world which has experienced futile and utopian conflicts for 14 centuries , '' said Sheikh Ali Salman , a Shia leader in Bahrain . 
Though Shias constitute 60 % of Bahrain 's population , they do not apparently aim for an Iraq-style change of regime , only for greater representation than they have achieved so far . 
But Iraqi Shia emancipation is also disturbing to a non-Shia country such as Jordan , because , small and fragile , it is deeply affected by any political upheavals in neighbors more powerful than itself , and its relatively benign autocracy does depend on discrimination of a kind , favoring Transjordanians over Palestinians . 
In multi-confessional Syria , minority Alawites dominate the regime ; Shia triumph in Iraq might encourage the majority Sunnis to regain the ascendancy which - the opposite of their co-religionists in Iraq - they lost with the rise of Ba'athism . 
It is obvious that all these regimes , like the Iraq insurgents themselves , hanker after a restoration of the old Sunni - or Ba'athist - dominated order , or even some Saddam-like figure to preside over it - or , at least , as King Abdullah once put it , `` somebody with a military background who has experience of being a tough guy '' . 
Equally obviously , however , the Shias , recalling what happened in the 20s , will not have it . 
So , like the Americans , the regimes have now calculated that , while holding elections , which a large part of the Sunni community might boycott , is a grave risk , not holding them would be a graver one . 
They are all - even Syria the US accuses of abetting the insurgency - urging the Sunnis to lend their vital sanction to the kind of popular consultation they would never permit in their own countries . 
For what makes Arab regimes fear an Iraqi democracy makes them fear civil war more ; and while quite possible with elections , that would be even more so without them . 
The Shias have so far been remarkably restrained in their response to the anti-Shia terror that seems to be a secondary part of the Sunni resistance to American occupation ; their mainstream religious leaders clearly want to keep their distance from Iran , and , according to a recent opinion poll , Sunnis are twice as much in favor of a fully fledged `` Islamic government '' of some kind as they are . 
But , if they can not come into their inheritance by constitutional means , they will be all too likely drawn into unconstitutional , violent means instead . 
And Iran would get deeply involved in that . 
"
2005-01-30,"' I lost my husband in the war but now I 've found a lifeline ' Jon Robins on a group that aims to get army widows back on their feet by giving vital information and support ` Looking back now I do n't know if I was really coping with my grief or not , ' recalls Samantha Roberts . 
` But at the time , I do n't believe you even think about whether you are coping or not . ' 
Samantha 's husband was the first soldier to die in action in the Iraq war and this time last year the 34-year-old was scarcely out of the press , as a result of a highly personal campaign to uncover the circumstances of her husband 's death . 
Steve , a 33-year-old sergeant from the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment , was shot in the stomach and chest by ` friendly fire ' in March 2003 as he was trying to calm a demonstration near Basra . 
Hours earlier he had been told to hand over his flak jacket to a soldier who was not equipped with one . 
Samantha was cast as the feisty widow from west Yorkshire who could bring down the Defense Secretary , Geoff Hoon , who appeared to be on the ropes following the furore over the death of government scientist Dr David Kelly . 
The ` showdown ' between grieving widow and minister , as the papers put it , took place a year ago this week . 
It was not until eight months after that low point that Samantha felt that she was coming to terms with Steve 's death . 
The occasion was when she met 30 other bereaved women at Amport House , the Armed Forces Chaplaincy Centre , near Andover in Hampshire . 
The chaplain talked about how grief affects people differently . 
` Up to that point I had never had anyone explain to me just what happens when you grieve , ' she says . 
` He talked for about 45 minutes and it shocked me when he described exactly how I felt . ' 
It was those few days that led her and the other women to set up a new group , the Army Widows Association , to provide a lifeline for the women who lose loved ones in the armed forces . 
The group aims to help widows get back on their feet by providing vital information on pension rights , accommodation entitlements and , most importantly , creating a network of women who share the same experience . 
Heather Saunders , another founding member of the group , was at the Amport House meeting . 
` Our husbands were taken from us ; they did n't choose to leave us , ' she says . 
` It is a shattering thing and what you want is support from other people who have been through it . ' 
Heather 's husband , Stephen , was defense attach at the British embassy in Athens when he was shot dead by two men on a motorbike as he drove to work . 
` People often come up and they sympathise , but how the hell do they know how I feel ? ' 
` They have n't a clue . ' 
The War Widows Association , a powerful political force , especially on pension rights , welcomes the new group . 
There are 47,000 war widows and 70 per cent are over 80 . 
Debbie Bowles , the group 's press officer , lost her husband in an aircraft crash 14 years ago over the North Sea . ' 
I remember going to church on a Sunday and thinking I ought to be sitting with the old ladies now I 'm a widow - but I was only 32 , ' she says . 
` You get a sense of understanding through knowing someone of your age who has been through it as well . ' 
Army widows often feel isolated . 
Geraldine McCool , a partner at the law firm McCool Patterson Hemsi , specialises in claims against the military . 
She represents more than 20 families of Iraqi servicemen , including Samantha Roberts , as well as the families of those killed in large-scale accidents , such as the 25 anti-terrorist experts who died when an RAF Chinook crashed in fog on the Mull of Kintyre in 1994 . 
` If you are living on base , you 're part of army life , ' she says . 
` If you lose your husband , then , in a way , you lose your wider family , which is the backing of the military community . ' 
The military can be very supportive to the bereaved if you embrace that life , she says , but it can also cut women adrift socially and in other ways . 
For example , the loss of a partner in the armed forces can mean the end of your subsidised home and perks such as Council Tax contributions , travel warrants , access to child care and creche or boarding school allowances . 
` Women have often sacrificed their careers to follow their husbands , ' Geraldine McCool points out . 
` For obvious reasons , it is extremely difficult to keep careers going on short-term deployments , particularly abroad . ' 
Unfortunately war widows ' pensions are not particularly generous -LRB- and end if you re-marry -RRB- . 
Samantha Roberts , who has no children , receives # 600 from her husband 's pension plus a war widow 's pension of # 90 . 
` That 's pretty insulting since Steve gave 15 years to the army and ultimately gave them his life , ' she says . 
She has always lived outside army quarters and been financially independent . 
Occasionally the Ministry of Defense acts with crass insensitivity . 
Take the case of Lianne Seymour , whose husband Ian Seymour , a Royal Marine , died when a US helicopter crashed in Kuwait at the start of the Iraq conflict in 2003 . 
Three days later she was told that she and her three-year-old son had six months to vacate their MoD-owned home and that she would have to return nine days ' wages paid to her husband in error . 
Mrs Seymour later received a personal apology from Geoff Hoon . 
The women behind the new Army Widows Association hope that they can help the army develop a new sensitivity . 
They are particularly concerned about the lack of training for liaison officers appointed to assist the bereaved . 
One widow recalls how the delegated soldier arrived at her house to drive her to pick up her husband 's body from the airport . 
` It was the second worst day of my life , ' she recalls . 
` But he turned up , full of the joys of spring , and the first thing he did was hand me this joke he 'd just been emailed . 
It was in such bad taste and possibly the most inappropriate thing he could have done . ' 
Army liaison officers are often ` the nearest person at the time ' , reports Heather Saunders . 
` They 're reading their brief on `` How to be a counsellor '' on their way to see a widow for the first time , ' she adds . 
Most importantly , the women hope that the group will help others through the bureaucratic fight for information with the MoD that takes over many women 's lives . 
` The army shies away from dealing with widows because they seem to think any sign of admitting fault or showing compassion will mean everyone is going to be on their back and suing them for thousands of pounds , ' says Heather Saunders .

2005-01-30,"It 's time to bin the past Fred Halliday , a leading expert on international affairs , says we are still infected by Cold War ills : an arrogant West , shabby dictators , naive protests Sunday 30 January 2005 01.25 GMT The thinkers and managers of world hegemony met amid the snow in Davos , Swizerland , last week while the anti-globalisation forces convened in the tropical summer of Porto Alegre , Brazil . 
As they assembled , the international system presented a much clearer picture than that through which the world had moved in the 14 years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War . 
In America we can see a President resolute in international bellicosity and a national consensus arrogantly indifferent to external concerns . 
We can also see the impact , within the US and internationally , of 9\/11 . 
The battle lines are drawn . 
Al-Qaeda does not have the capacity to destroy the West , but it does have the capacity to mobilise for years to come . 
In Ariel Sharon and George Bush it has found two stalwart recruiting sergeants . 
More important still has been the consolidated rise of China . 
After five centuries when the Atlantic was the strategic and economic center of the world , the focus has shifted to East Asia and the Pacific . 
This , not Iraq , is the dominant story of 2004 . 
Last year marked the end of the interregnum following the end of the Cold War , the third chapter in the great European civil war in which the two world wars marked the initial two chapters . 
Yet this apparent distance between the contemporary world and the Cold War is delusory and dangerously so . 
The intellectual challenge is how to characterise this condition . 
We have had some grand , if preposterous , theories : the New World Order , the New Middle Ages , the End of History , the Clash of Civilisations , now the War Against Terrorism . 
In an attempt to comprehend the contemporary international system , this article proposes another narrative : the Three Dustbins Theory . 
The Three Dustbins Theory rests on the claim that , despite the receding of the Cold War , we remain , in key respects , prisoners of its legacy and will , unless we face up to these questions , remain so . 
As with all unacknowledged influences from the past , these repositories of conflict and myth are all the more powerful because unacknowledged . 
Dustbin Number One contains the legacies of the Soviet and communist periods . 
Among its contents are : an array of uncontrolled and unmonitored nuclear materials ; a set of unresolved , sanguinary inter-ethnic problems inherited from the Soviet period - Bosnia , Kosovo , Transdniestr , Nagorno-Karabakh , Chechnya , Eritrea-Ethiopia - in all of which the costs of ethnic expulsion and fragmented government have provided a context for entrenched mafioso power ; and the consolidation , in nearly all of the former Soviet Union and much of former pro-Soviet Africa -LRB- as in the Horn of Africa and Mozambique -RRB- of corrupt elites , a transition not to democracy but to post-Marxist kleptocracy . 
Most significant of all of these is the political character of the two most important states to have undergone the communist experiment : the neo-authoritarian dictatorship of Vladimir Putin in Russia , and the politically immobile dictatorship of the communist leaders in China . 
No transition to democracy here and none likely , not least because these two groups of rulers play the coquette to Washington in the matter of their ` wars ' against Chechen and Sinkiang opponents . 
The Second Dustbin is that of the West , and the US in particular . 
One of the costs of winning the Cold War is that the West has failed to rethink its assumptions about the conduct of international relations . 
Instead , and above all with the Bush administration , we have seen the recycling , often by veterans of the confrontations with the Soviet Union in the 1970s , of policies that were as wrong then as they are now : the fabrication of threats , accompanied by dire warnings about how time ` is running out ' , about hostile states ; the repetition ad nauseam of platitudes about the role of force in international affairs that no first-year student could get away with ; a suspicion , if not disdain , for international institutions , notably the UN and international law ; a facile , historically short-sighted and grossly exaggerated set of claims about how many states conform to an acceptable model of democracy -LRB- the ` Free World ' of the 1950s and 1960s recycled -RRB- . 
Of the cruel , and intellectually bankrupt , certainties of neo-liberalism , which has undermined the social provision and regulation roles of the state across the world , there is no need to say more . 
Meanwhile , US neo-conservative family planning policy , by blocking the use of contraception and abortion , is in league with the patriarch of St Peter 's Square , condemning millions to avoidable death . 
However , the greatest , and least acknowledged , legacies of the Cold War on the Western side lie in two other domains . 
Here pervasive denial , compounded by self-righteous declamation , reign supreme . 
One such legacy concerns the origins of the terrorist threat itself : al-Qaeda and its like did not arise suddenly in 2001 , or from the subconscious of the Islamic or Arab minds , but from the Cold War , in particular the financing , training and arming of tens of thousands of jihadi militants by the US , Saudi Arabia and Pakistan for the war in Afghanistan in the 1980s . 
That war was to the early 21st century what the Spanish Civil War was to the mid-20th , the devils kitchen in which the criminal practices later unleashed on the world were first brewed . 
It is the greatest , if not the only , solecism of Bush 's anti-terrorist campaign that he is incapable , as is American public opinion as a whole , of recognizing how far the US helped to prepare this movement , as it did the Unita murderers in Angola , the Contras in Nicaragua , and , at one remove , Renamo in Mozambique . 
The other , now more evident than ever , legacy of Cold War on the Western side is both simple and all-pervasive : the mental attitude accompanying the exercise of power over other peoples , and the discussion of it , by Washington , one predominantly of arrogance , ignorance and instinctive resort to force . 
This mindset , often decked out with frothing claims about ` imperial burdens ' and ` grand strategy ' , was evident in the Cold War itself , not least in the grotesque continuation of a nuclear arms race over four decades , but also draws in the US , as it does in much of post-imperial Europe , on the unacknowledged cultural legacy of colonialism . 
The West has still not learned to treat the rest of the world on an equal footing , a point most graphically illustrated by the photographs from Abu Ghraib : it is , above all , not because the victims were Muslim , Arab , or even non-white , but because they were from a subordinate people that they were subjected with such levity and sadism to their tortures . 
It might be thought prudent to stop the argument there , with a denunciation of the powerful in East and West . 
But the unacknowledged legacy of the Cold War does not stop there , and is equally to be found among those protesting against globalisation and meeting in Porto Alegre . 
The Third Dustbin is that of the contemporary global protest movement , to a considerable degree a children 's crusade of intellectual demagogues , recycled 1960s bunkeristas with their fellow travellers in literary circles , dreamers and political manipulators , of the old and new lefts , whose claim to moral and analytic superiority too often masks a set of unexamined , and themselves often recycled , platitudes from the Cold War period and , indeed , from the ideology of the communist world . 
It is as if , having appeared to die in Moscow in 1991 , the anti-capitalist world movement leapt from the coffin , like James Joyce 's corpse Finegan at his Wake , at Seattle in 1999 , having learned nothing at all . 
Indeed the contents of this Third Dustbin are familiar enough : a ritual incantantion of ` no war ' that avoids any substantive engagement with problems of international peace and security , or reflection on how positively to help peoples in zones of conflict ; a set of vague , unthought out , uncosted and often dangerous utopian ideas about an alternative world ; a pleasing but vapid invocation of global human values and internationalism that blithely ignores the misuses to which that term was put in the 20th century -LRB- for example by Stalin or Mao -RRB- ; a complacent attitude , innocent when not indulgent , towards political violence -LRB- witness the cult of Che Guevara , a cruel and dangerous man , and the invitees from Northern Ireland , Palestine and Iran , to name but three at the London Social Summit in October -RRB- . 
This was a capitulation , that would have shocked their socialist forebears , to nationalist and religious bigots -LRB- as in the reception by the supposedly left-wing Mayor of London of Sheikh Yusif al-Qaradawi , the descendant of a line of Mus lim fascist thinkers -RRB- . 
There is also a vapid and politically ineffective attitude to nature , forgetting , as the tsunami should have reminded all of us , that nature can also kill . 
And all of this is mixed up with a shallow , repetitive critique of globalisation , in the name of what we are never sure , and a naive , uninformed , analysis of the US . 
Such a critique applies , in the first place , to the Western and affiliated Third World protest movement . 
But it applies with even greater force to the murderous vapidities promulgated by the most prominent alternative center of resistance , that of radical Sunni jihadism , be it of Bin Laden or al-Zarqawi : these people are devoid of any substantive ideas about how to run a modern society , economy or political system . 
Here is in essence the Three Dustbins Theory . 
That unchallenged ideas and political legacies take their toll was familiar to the wise of earlier times . 
Marx remarked that the legacy of past generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living . 
Keynes said that behind the ideas of every politician lay the thought of some dead economist . 
Freud warned us of the toll taken by the repressed . 
All would find much that is familiar in the world today . 
We can assess the outcome of discussions in Davos and Porto Alegre to see if thinking on the current crises of the world has moved on . 
Here ideas and policies should meet what I term the ` Vilanova Test ' , named after the flinty Spanish writer Pere Vilanova , who , on the basis of years of political engagement and debate in Spain and the Arab world , has argued consistently for pensamiento duro , ` tough thinking ' , in the contemporary world . 
We certainly have , and may again be treated to , plenty of the other .

2005-02-01,"Tuesday 1 February 2005 14.59 GMT Al-Jazeera has been ranked the fifth most influential brand in the world , behind global icons Apple and Google , in a survey by a worldwide branding consultancy . 
The Arab news satellite channel had the fifth largest impact on the lives of 1,984 readers of Interbrand 's Brandchannel.com , behind Apple , Google , Ikea and Starbucks . 
The Qatar-based network has been a constant feature of news reports in the last two years as a result of its coverage of the Iraq war and its aftermath , when terrorist network al-Qaida became the focus of American ire . 
One of its reporters was arrested in Spain and it has been kicked out of Baghdad by the Iraqi interim government on the grounds that it was a destablising influence . 
The network faced controversy again today when it was forced to defend its use of a video that purports to show the shooting down of an RAF Hercules in Iraq , which killed 10 people . 
The editor of Brandchannel.com , Robin Rusch , said the survey showed brands that were making a big instant impact but might not have the global staying power of `` super brands '' such as McDonald 's or Coca-Cola . 
`` The reason why viewers chose it both in the global section and in European and African survey is that it is the alternative news source for anyone in the west to get another point of view that 's not coming to them from their own media , '' she said . 
`` Osama bin Laden uses it as his station of choice to get his message across and here in the US with a population that is not Arab speaking we see regular mentions of al-Jazeera reports . '' 
This year the channel will move further towards the mainstream with the launch in November of an English-language international news channel that will run alongside its Arabic news service and rival CNN and BBC World . 
`` As the issues of 2004 hovered heavily around the Middle East and Islamic populations , al-Jazeera 's relevancy soared , '' the Brandchannel.com report said . 
`` Al-Jazeera is viewed as relatively independent within its region and is increasingly gaining mainstream credibility beyond its borders . '' 
The channel , launched in 1996 and watched by some 35 million viewers , recently reconfirmed that it was going to seek private equity partners or go for a flotation . 
However , a spokesman today said such a move was some way off and a feasibility study would be submitted to the Emir of Qatar , the owner of the channel by the end of the year . 
Brandchannel 's 2004 Reader 's Choice Awards listed 75 global brands and 75 regional brands and asked readers to list the top five brands that had affected them personally , in either and positive or negative way , the most last year . 
Ms Rausch said non-government organizations and charities , such as Tsunami Relief , would have a huge impact this year due to the Boxing Day tsunami that killed more than 250,000 people . 
She said the survey methodology sometimes threw up interesting results , such as the 2001 survey , which led to al-Qaida ranking 14th , even though some objected to the terrorist group being classified as a brand .

2005-02-01,"The Vietnam turnout was good as well No amount of spin can conceal Iraqis ' hostility to US occupation Tuesday 1 February 2005 02.38 GMT On September 4 1967 the New York Times published an upbeat story on presidential elections held by the South Vietnamese puppet regime at the height of the Vietnam war . 
Under the heading `` US encouraged by Vietnam vote : Officials cite 83 % turnout despite Vietcong terror '' , the paper reported that the Americans had been `` surprised and heartened '' by the size of the turnout `` despite a Vietcong terrorist campaign to disrupt the voting '' . 
A successful election , it went on , `` has long been seen as the keystone in President Johnson 's policy of encouraging the growth of constitutional processes in South Vietnam '' . 
The echoes of this weekend 's propaganda about Iraq 's elections are so close as to be uncanny . 
With the past few days ' avalanche of spin , you could be forgiven for thinking that on January 30 2005 the US-led occupation of Iraq ended and the people won their freedom and democratic rights . 
This has been a multi-layered campaign , reminiscent of the pre-war WMD frenzy and fantasies about the flowers Iraqis were collecting to throw at the invasion forces . 
How you could square the words democracy , free and fair with the brutal reality of occupation , martial law , a US-appointed election commission and secret candidates has rarely been allowed to get in the way of the hype . 
If truth is the first casualty of war , reliable numbers must be the first casualty of an occupation-controlled election . 
The second layer of spin has been designed to convince us that an overwhelming majority of Iraqis participated . 
The initial claim of 72 % having voted was quickly downgraded to 57 % of those registered to vote . 
So what percentage of the adult population is registered to vote ? 
The Iraqi ambassador in London was unable to enlighten me . 
In fact , as UN sources confirm , there has been no registration or published list of electors - all we are told is that about 14 million people were entitled to vote . 
As for Iraqis abroad , the up to 4 million strong exiled community -LRB- with perhaps a little over 2 million entitled to vote -RRB- produced a 280,000 registration figure . 
Of those , 265,000 actually voted . 
The Iraqi south , more religious than Baghdad , responded positively to Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani 's position : to call the bluff of the US and vote for a list that was proclaimed to be hostile to the occupation . 
Sistani 's supporters declared that voting on Sunday was the first step to kicking out the occupiers . 
The months ahead will put these declarations to a severe test . 
Meanwhile Moqtada al-Sadr 's popular movement , which rejected the elections as a sham , is likely to make a comeback in its open resistance to the occupation . 
The big vote in Kurdistan primarily reflects the Kurdish people 's demand for national self-determination . 
The US administration has hitherto clamped down on these pressures . 
Henry Kissinger 's recent proposal to divide Iraq into three states reflects a major shift among influential figures in the US who , led by Kissinger as secretary of state , ditched the Kurds in the 70s and brokered a deal between Saddam and the Shah of Iran . 
George Bush and Tony Blair made heroic speeches on Sunday implying that Iraqis had voted to approve the occupation . 
Those who insist that the US is desperate for an exit strategy are misreading its intentions . 
The facts on the ground , including the construction of massive military bases in Iraq , indicate that the US is digging in to install and back a long-term puppet regime . 
For this reason , the US-led presence will continue , with all that entails in terms of bloodshed and destruction . 
In the run-up to the poll , much of the western media presented it as a high-noon shootout between the terrorist Zarqawi and the Iraqi people , with the occupation forces doing their best to enable the people to defeat the fiendish , one-legged Jordanian murderer . 
In reality , Zarqawi-style sectarian violence is not only condemned by Iraqis across the political spectrum , including supporters of the resistance , but is widely seen as having had a blind eye turned to it by the occupation authorities . 
Such attitudes are dismissed by outsiders , but the record of John Negroponte , the US ambassador in Baghdad , of backing terror gangs in central America in the 80s has fuelled these fears , as has Seymour Hirsh 's reports on the Pentagon 's assassination squads and enthusiasm for the `` Salvador option '' . 
An honest analysis of the social and political map of Iraq reveals that Iraqis are increasingly united in their determination to end the occupation . 
Whether they participated in or boycotted Sunday 's exercise , this political bond will soon reassert itself - just as it did in Vietnam - despite tactical differences , and despite the US-led occupation 's attempts to dominate Iraqis by inflaming sectarian and ethnic divisions .

2005-02-01,"Crusading in the public interest Phil Shiner became an overnight hate figure for his opposition to British army abuses in Iraq . 
But , as Richard Norton-Taylor discovers , the lawyer is used to controversy Tuesday 1 February 2005 00.01 GMT Mention his name and the Ministry of Defense shudders . 
He is the target of death threats . 
An investigation was launched into his activities after he was viciously attacked in the pages of the Daily Mail . 
The inquiry is being carried out by the Legal Services Commission , the body which oversees legal aid - the same organization that subsequently welcomed one of his high court victories as `` historic '' . 
That case was cited recently when he won the Liberty and Justice human rights lawyer of the year award . 
He received the award for `` outstanding skill and tenacity in taking test cases to protect the rights of Iraqi civilians tortured and killed by British forces '' . 
He was also praised for his `` personal sacrifice and professional dedication in fighting for justice and individual rights '' . 
Phil Shiner , on whom praise and blame , it seems , is heaped almost in equal measure , is not afraid to court controversy . 
Just as well , given the causes he has taken up , ranging from the rights of former Gurkha soldiers to the wrongs of nuclear weapons . 
He set up his Birmingham-based law firm , Public Interest Lawyers , in 1999 after a spell in private practice concentrating on environmental law . 
One of his earliest cases , he remembers , was against Edwina Currie . 
She was then a Conservative member of Birmingham city council . 
Shiner was , he says , a `` fresh-faced idealistic member of Small Heath law center '' . 
She was pushing forward what he calls a `` punishment block '' for what were considered the worst tenants . 
He took the case to the high court , forcing the council to demolish the flats . 
Shiner , 48 , was educated at Bishop Ullathorne Roman Catholic comprehensive school in Coventry . 
Last week , he returned there to give a talk to the sixth form , encouraging the pupils , he says , to believe in themselves and to go places . 
So what drives him ? 
`` Throughout my life , I have always been a passionate believer in social justice . 
It comes from my Catholic upbringing . '' 
He goes on retreat to Iona every year and he has always been a socialist , he says . 
`` Socialism and Catholicism go hand in hand . '' 
Is n't the title Public Interest Lawyers - the firm has just six employees , including three solicitors - a bit presumptuous ? 
Shiner replies that he is not out to define the public interest ; rather , to make the point that there is a strong public-interest component to the cases - and causes - he takes on . 
For many human rights lawyers , a lot of the issues he tackles are pretty unfashionable . 
Take some of his environmental cases . 
They include damage done by incinerators burning hazardous or dangerous substances , landfills , open-cast coal schemes , quarries , chemical plants , inappropriately sited mobile-phone masts , and industrial or commercial developments on greenfield land . 
`` Litigation through judicial review is a relatively blunt instrument , '' says his firm 's website . 
`` We aim for a preventative approach to these polluting developments . 
We are not personal injury lawyers who act to sue for damages once a project has caused harm to public health and the environment . '' 
It continues : `` PIL try to take pre-emptive action , that is , to make representations to a decision-maker prior to a decision being made , say , to grant planning permission for a particular project . 
In that way we feed our legal representations into the broader political process so that an authority might be persuaded not to grant consent at all . 
For example , if an incinerator is unacceptable to the local community because of the increased levels of prescribed pollutants , it is better to persuade a local planning authority of that than expect a judge on judicial review to enter the debate as to whether that is or is not acceptable . 
Many of our successes have been in persuading public bodies to refuse consent for polluting projects so that , once the developer decides not to appeal , the community can close the book on the problem . '' 
Shiner also takes on nuclear power - every aspect of it . 
Tomorrow , he is appealing against the refusal of legal aid for a case to decide whether the nuclear weapons facility at Faslane in Scotland should abide by the Radioactive Substances Act , an issue , he says , which is important for the local community . 
The nuclear weapons plant at Aldermaston in Berkshire , and the naval dockyard at Devonport , the navy 's nuclear submarine base , should also be subject to extra safeguards , he says . 
He is taking comfort from the decision by the European Commission to seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg that health and safety rules should apply to military as well as civil sites . 
Shiner has pursued equally strenuously the issue of the legality of nuclear weapons and Britain 's special nuclear weapons relationship with the United States . 
He acted for CND - with Rabinder Singh QC , a founding member of Matrix barristers ' chambers with Tony Blair 's wife , Cherie Booth QC - in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the high court to rule on whether the invasion of Iraq was legal . 
He believes the use of cluster bombs is an issue that should be heard by the International Criminal Court . 
And he is now preparing a case on behalf of Quakers and others , arguing that they should not have to pay the part of their taxes which is spent on armaments and warfare . 
Unsurprisingly , he is not the most Ministry of Defense 's most popular lawyer . 
Last year , he threatened a judicial review of the prime minister 's decision to give ex-Gurkhas the right of abode in Britain , but only those who had recently left the regiment . 
The government gave way and Geoff Hoon , the defense secretary , has now announced a full review of the terms and conditions of service of all Gurkhas . 
It is not the first time that Shiner has taken up the Gurkhas ' cause . 
He says one of his high points is winning the argument , in the high court and then the court of appeal , that ex-Gurkhas captured by the Japanese should be given a # 10,000 ex gratia payment on a par with other armed services inmates of the wartime concentration camps . 
Some 1,000 Gurkhas and their families benefited . 
A `` low moment '' was his decision to seek evidence from Iraqi families whose relatives , allegedly , had been killed , mistreated or even tortured by British troops in southern Iraq after the last Iraq war was declared over . 
The high-profile case provoked huge controversy . 
`` Anyone Else Want to Sue ? '' 
the Daily Mail asked last year in a banner headline . '' 
` Murder ' Slur on Our Soldiers '' , it declared , adding : `` Solicitor who yesterday accused British troops of murder went touting for clients in Iraq - and , yes , you 've guessed it , wants legal aid , too . '' 
The newspaper published a cartoon of a large Iraqi at dinner with his wife , reading a phrasebook , a solicitor hanging upside down from a rafter in the background . 
`` I 've just worked out what he said after ` I 'm English ' , '' she says . 
`` It was : ` Do you want to sue anybody ? ' '' 
Shiner received a number of death threats as a result of his work on this case . 
`` You 're doing it for Muslims , and Arabs , and other dirty Iraqi bastards , '' said one . 
He was sent packets of white powder . 
That was not all . 
The Legal Services Commission launched an investigation over allegations that he touted for business . 
The pressure was so great , Shiner says , that he almost felt that he could not go ahead with his marriage to Rachel , his second wife . 
`` For three hours , I thought , ' I ca n't do this . 
This is too much . ' '' 
Then , in December , Shiner , who is now acting for some 40 Iraqi families , won his case . 
In a landmark judgment , the high court ruled that British troops on foreign operations are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights , which bans torture and inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners . 
Specifically , it ruled that the convention extended to a prison in Iraq where Baha Mousa , a hotel receptionist , died last year while in the custody of British soldiers . 
In what Lord Justice Rix and Mr Justice Forbes called a `` difficult and troubling case '' , the judges said that British troops were `` in effective control '' of the prison where Mousa died . 
The MoD is appealing against the judgment . 
Clare Dodgson , the Legal Services Commission 's chief executive , trumpeted the commission 's part in funding the case , describing the judgment as a `` historic legal ruling '' . 
Though it carried no implication of guilt or wrongdoing by British soldiers , she said , it allowed for allegations surrounding deaths in custody to be `` fairly and independently investigated '' . 
Meanwhile , the commission is still looking into the allegations against the lawyer who brought this historic case to court . 
Shiner describes the support he has received from his peers as phenomenal . 
He is fighting in an honorable lawyers ' tradition , he says - `` guilty of pursuing cases in a single-minded way and upsetting powerful people '' .

2005-02-04,"How the right played the fascism card against Islam Friday 4 February 2005 00.03 GMT Fascism is coming back into fashion , at least in the propaganda wars . 
For the right , it comes in the shape of a new word : `` islamofascism '' . 
That conflates all the elements into one image : suicide bombs , kidnappings and the Qur ` an ; the fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan ; Iranian clerics and Hitler . 
The term seems to have appeared first in the Washington Times in a reference to Islamist fundamentalists . 
Coined by Khalid Duran , a Muslim scholar seeking to explain Islam to Jews , the word was meant as a criticism of hyper-traditionalist clerics - who in turn denounced Duran as a traitor to the faith . 
Usage has gathered momentum among commentators and academics who seek a verbal missile to debilitate those who disagree with them . 
They have adopted it as a sort of Judeo-Christian war cry - look for it soon in the title of a neo-conservative think tank conference . 
For the left , the term `` fascist '' lost its power in the 1970s , when it was sprayed on every authority figure in sight , from the Nixon-Kissinger White House to university provosts to the neighborhood cop . 
To make Bush-Hitler comparisons work requires more nuanced historical references - to the night of the long knives , for example , as Sidney Blumenthal did about the dismissal of Colin Powell . 
Unfortunately for liberals , those references do n't work as efficiently as islamofascism does for the right , because to imagine the appropriately creepy picture requires a familiarity with German history of the 1920s and 30s . 
Nazism is better known for its death camps than for Leni Riefenstahl or the Reichstag fire , so analogies between the Nazis ' early years and current Republican party behavior seem hollow , no matter how strong some parallels might be . 
Christopher Hitchens , a former socialist who now sits on the other end of the political see-saw , sprinkles islamofascism about like paprika . 
He and Andrew Sullivan , a voice of the right , both wrongly receive credit in some quarters for coining the term . 
Long before September 11 2001 , Duran was commissioned by the American Jewish Committee to produce one side of an interfaith project . 
Duran responded to attacks on his book , Children of Abraham , by deriding those who sought `` to impose religious orthodoxy on the state and the citizenry '' . 
In that sense , he said , extreme islamism is `` islamofascism . '' 
It took a couple of years for the word to seep into frequent usage . 
By then its meaning had expanded . 
Last year , Sullivan cited `` five elements that make it particularly dangerous '' , including the `` broken , medieval societies '' that foster it , the `` unquenchable extremism '' of its motivation , and `` the destructive technology '' its adherents seek . 
Use of the term to describe Muslim clerics and stateless terrorists has neatly pre-empted any chance of labeling Bush a fascist - no matter how many suspects are kidnapped by the US authorities and tortured ; no matter how impervious the border ; no matter how effective the use of propaganda to destroy the opposition ; no matter how many countries are invaded on false pretenses ; no matter how strongly a minority religion may become a mark of guilt .

2005-02-04,"Haunted by his experiences as an army medic in Iraq , David McGough could n't cope with life after his tour of duty . 
Yet it took two failed suicide attempts before he was diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder . 
Alison Roberts on the forgotten casualties of the war The first symptom was sleeplessness . 
It was July 2003 and Lance Corporal David McGough of the Royal Army Medical Corps was just back from a five-month tour of duty in Basra , Iraq . 
Lots of the lads from his unit had trouble settling back to a normal routine at first , but most were OK within a fortnight or so . 
David , however , did not sleep for an entire month . 
`` My body just would n't switch off , '' he tells me , fidgeting with his hands . 
`` All the time this tension was building , this incredibly tense restlessness . 
I was going for weeks without any sleep at all and then collapsing , sleeping for maybe six hours , and then starting all over again . '' 
At night , on leave , he walked around his small maisonette in a suburb of Preston , Lancashire , folding and re-folding his clothes , checking and double-checking the locks , looking over his shoulder repeatedly for imagined intruders . 
McGough was vomiting every day , often bloodily . 
The odour of cooking or burned meat made him sick , though `` the worst thing is the smell of public toilets '' . 
`` That brings the PoW camps back . 
The stench of those places was horrendous . '' 
Mostly it was the insomnia that started to drive him mad , that made him crash his car and almost beat his then-fiancee , that both masked and exacerbated his chronic underlying depression . 
The army doctor at the camp in Preston prescribed him Prozac and more or less told him to pull himself together . 
When Prozac failed to work , McGough was given a stronger antidepressant , citalopram , `` but no sleeping tablets , and by then - Christmas - I was n't really sleeping at all '' . 
McGough 's two attempts at suicide , both at Christmas in 2003 , were more cries for help than committed bids to kill himself . 
On the first occasion he held a knife across his throat until his sister begged him to put it down , and on the second he put a 9mm pistol to his head but did not pull the trigger fully . 
Horrified by what was happening , McGough 's father , a civil servant based in Northern Ireland , called Dr Alun Jones , a civilian psychiatrist who specialises in diagnosing and treating psychological problems in servicemen and women . 
`` It was immediately clear , '' says Jones , `` that McGough was suffering a severe case of post-traumatic stress disorder . '' 
So far , PTSD experts have seen a mere handful of British sufferers from this latest war in Iraq - but as the violence goes on , the trickle is expected to become a flood . 
Late last year , the independent inquiry into Gulf war illnesses chaired by Lord Lloyd of Berwick came to the conclusion that there was `` every reason '' to accept the existence of a Gulf war syndrome , and that post-traumatic stress was one of several contributing factors . 
Though the Ministry of Defense does not publish statistical predictions , military psychiatrists in America have been warned to expect psychiatric disorder to occur in a remarkable 20 % of servicemen and women returning from Iraq . 
`` What we 've got now is a situation starting to approximate to Northern Ireland or Bosnia , to civil insurrection rather than a straight shooting war , '' says Jones , who runs PTSD clinics around the country and at a residential center in north Wales . 
`` In those kinds of circumstances , where you 're experiencing hatred and violence from an unpredictable civilian population , we tend to get a lot of very disturbed and damaged soldiers . '' 
In the field of trauma studies , this atmosphere of constant and random danger is known by the shorthand `` no safe place '' . 
Other surveys suggest that roughly half the servicemen who suffer psychiatric illness as a result of traumatic events do not seek medical help , or do so years later , when the psychological afterburn has irreparably damaged marriages , careers and mental wellbeing . 
`` And there 's still a stigma attached , '' says Leigh Skelton , director of clinical services at Combat Stress , the ex-services mental welfare charity . 
`` PTSD is seen as a career-stopper within the army . 
Generally , the first line of action servicemen and women take is to bottle it up . 
Then they 'll self-medicate , usually with alcohol , sometimes with other substances . 
Cries for help often come from relatives rather than from the affected person . '' 
Symptoms range from insomnia , nausea and extreme fatigue to the classic `` flashback '' ; aggression , feelings of alienation and irrational anger . 
Sometimes the disorder centres on one particular memory . 
A 30-year-old female ambulance driver in the Territorial Army , for example , constantly replays the moment her vehicle was blown up last year by a hand-made bomb tied to a lamp-post in Basra . 
One marine in his early 20s now suffering chronic PTSD remembers `` the fear in the eyes of an Iraqi soldier in the window '' of a building mortared by the British ; and seeing that fear again when British soldiers mistakenly opened fire on a civilian vehicle . 
McGough , however , identified no single trigger . 
Skinny and pale , when I met him in late November he was a shadow of the strong young man he was pre-Iraq - the high-flyer who studied psychology at Queen 's College , Belfast , who loved to sky-dive and socialise , who was promoted within a year of joining the RAMC . 
For him , the pressure began the moment he and his medical unit moved into Iraq , at 2.30 am on the first night of the war , four hours after the Americans began their aerial bombardment of Baghdad . 
McGough was 21 years old and effectively in charge of 80 rookie soldiers fresh out of training , most of them still teenagers . 
As medics , they traveled in canvas-roofed trucks and were not equipped with body armor . 
`` There was gunfire everywhere . 
Some of them were literally crapping themselves in the back of those trucks . '' 
That first night , there was n't even time to pitch camp . 
`` The worst casualty I saw was an Iraqi guy hit about 13 times , big chunks of his stomach , face and legs just gone . 
We intubated him and opened him up by the side of a truck . 
You do it on autopilot at the time because your training kicks in . 
It 's only afterwards you start to think about what you 've seen and done . '' 
The mobile field unit , the first line of medical services , was initially established just south of Basra , but was twice relocated to escape attack . 
Its job was to mop up trauma cases , stabilise them and send them to field hospitals nearer the southern border . 
According to McGough , the medical unit received up to 1,000 wounded Iraqis during his five-and-a-half-month tour of duty , of whom perhaps 60 % died and were buried in mass graves . 
A large proportion of the medics ' work , however , took place in the PoW camps set up on each site . 
`` Usually we had about 150 prisoners coming in a day , '' says McGough , `` both soldiers and civilians who 'd been picked up with guns . 
Some had clearly been tortured by the Iraqi regime . 
There was one man who had thick black stuff , like goo , coming out of his penis , and said he 'd been injected with something when he was a prisoner before . 
Others had quite infected lash wounds on their backs , or broken jaw bones . '' 
The unit also saw a number of raped women , who were treated and counselled by a female army gynaecologist . 
Seemingly futile or absurd situations are known to compound wartime trauma . 
The unit 's first location at Basra was regularly attacked by Iraqis defending a nearby ammunition dump from a maze-like system of trenches . 
`` There was no adherence to any kind of convention on their part . 
Sometimes it was ridiculous . 
Every time we hit and wounded someone , a white flag would go up on their side and the others would bring the man we 'd wounded over to the base for treatment . 
Then they 'd go back up and start shooting at us again . '' 
Most harrowing of all was the discovery of the corpse of a 12-year-old girl who 'd been hanged in a backstreet alley in Basra . 
McGough was sent to confirm the death and recognized her as the child to whom he and his comrades had chatted the week before . 
`` We heard later that she was probably hanged by the crowd because she 'd been talking to our crew ... That was one of the worst things . 
You expect to see some nasty stuff , but seeing a little girl hanging in the street because she once spoke to you ... '' PTSD has been a recognized injury of war for more than 30 years , yet treatment in Britain is still very patchy . 
It took complete break-down -LRB- `` my girlfriend found me one night huddled on the floor , shaking and crying '' -RRB- and several emergency trips to hospital in Preston before McGough was finally prescribed sleeping tablets . 
While a member of the British army , he was unable to access the civilian care system - and had been informed of a decision to discharge him without a pension . 
`` The army is not a branch of the social services , '' says Jones , `` but I do think there is a certain duty of care , knowing what we now know about the effects of trauma . 
It would be reasonable to expect the army to check these lads over for psychological injury when they come back from combat , but in fact there is no obligation whatsoever to do this . '' 
`` No one rings or visits in the mornings because I 'm just a horrible , nasty person before the drugs have kicked in , '' says McGough . 
He was increasingly convinced that his physical symptoms - the vomiting and chronic weight loss - are related to anthrax injections and to the Naps tablets taken to counter the potential use of enemy nerve agents . 
On bad days he does not get out of bed at all . 
`` I loved being in the army , '' he says . 
`` It was supposed to be my long-term career , and I was prepared to give everything to it ... I just wish I could shake this and get on with my life again . ''

2005-02-04,"Friday 4 February 2005 15.55 GMT An Italian woman journalist has been kidnapped in Baghdad as she interviewed local people on the street . 
Iraqi police sources said Giuliana Sgrena , a journalist on the Rome based Il Manifesto paper , was abducted outside Baghdad University . 
She was conducting interviews near the university when four gunmen snatched her from her car at about 2pm , the Italian news agency ANSA said in a report after speaking to Sgrena 's interpreter . 
Two Iraqi journalists traveling with Sgrena were released after the gunmen stopped the car they were traveling in . 
Italian Foreign Ministry officials said they were investigating the report , while Il Manifesto said Sgrena had been working for the paper in Iraq since January 23 and had called in just two hours earlier . 
She is the second Italian journalist to be kidnapped in Iraq since the start of the war . 
Last August Enzo Baldoni , an Italian freelance journalist working for Milan weekly Diario , was killed eight days after he went missing en route to Najaf , then the scene of heavy fighting between US troops and supporters of Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr . 
Sgrena 's kidnapping comes a month after French reporter Florence Aubenas and her Iraqi assistant Hanoun Al-Saadi went missing in Baghdad . 
Today international press freedom lobby group Reporters Sans Frontieres said that , though they could not rule out any other explanation for Aubenas 's disappearance , `` kidnapping with no political motive seems the most likely scenario at the moment '' . 
Since US forces invaded the country , Iraq has become the most dangerous country in the world for journalists and media workers , journalist groups have said . 
In a report earlier this year the International Federation of Journalists called on governments to do more to protect journalists after 129 media workers were killed last year , 69 of them in Iraq .

2005-02-06,"British industrialists are angry that huge American companies like Halliburton and Bechtel win so much business in the UK Haliburton , the US engineering giant formerly headed by vice-president Dick Cheney , has long been a bte noir of British business . 
But as talks to hammer out a deal over Britain 's new aircraft carriers reached crisis point this weekend , it has never been less loved . 
Since the Iraq war , when the Houston company won contracts to put out oil fires in Iraq without having to bid against competitors , it has been synonymous with White House cronyism . 
British engineers and oil industry operators felt they had been frozen out of lucrative work and spat blood . 
When it emerged that Halliburton was overcharging for the petrol it was importing from Kuwait , the anger grew . 
Investigations into the activities of Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Root in the Gulf revealed tales of kickbacks to employees , poor cost control , and further overcharging . 
Nevertheless , Halliburton secured more contracts to work on Iraqi oil infrastructure . 
US congressmen headed by Democrat Henry Waxman demanded investigations , not least into the role of Cheney in the contracting process . 
According to the US Congress committee on government reform , Halliburton has received $ 10.3 billion from contracts there . 
Although US government work in Iraq is channelling less into company coffers this year than last , it still contributed $ 1.7 bn of total $ 5.2 bn revenue in the last quarter of last year . 
This at a time when Halliburton faces claims worth billions in asbestos-related lawsuits , which saw it post a fourth-quarter net loss of close to $ 1bn . 
Halliburton is facing several investigations around the world . 
KBR is part of a consortium that is under investigation for allegations of bribery in a Nigerian gas contract . 
And back in the post-Enron US , the company last year paid $ 7.5 m to settle accusations that it misled investors because it did not disclose an accounting change in 1998 , when Cheney was CEO . 
But last week the focus was in Britain as KBR UK appeared close to winning a vital role on Britain 's largest-ever naval shipbuilding contract , the roughly # 3bn program to build two new aircraft carriers . 
Ministry of Defense officials were preparing to announce that KBR had been chosen as the ` physical integrator ' -LRB- PI -RRB- on the program , the overseer that will manage the complicated integration of design , systems and construction by a wide range of prime and sub contractors . 
BAE Systems , the UK 's largest defense firm , was furious . 
BAE is part of the alliance - along with Thales of France and the MoD itself - that was formed to manage the project . 
It is the owner of two of the yards where hull modules could be built . 
It said it would pull out of the alliance if KBR was chosen as the PI . 
BAE says there is no need to have a body above the alliance and is livid at the thought of it being KBR . 
` They do n't have a happy reputation either here or overseas , ' one company source said last week . 
The prospect of KBR taking the ` overseer of overseers ' role has united the UK 's often bickering shipbuilders . 
` If they award it to KBR you are going to have the Americans and the French running the carrier program , ' says one . 
` The whole thing is a nonsense . ' 
It is hard to separate two key issues : unhappiness at the way the carrier contract has been handled over the past two years , and simple dislike of KBR . 
BAE was unhappy that its role as prime contractor was open to competition in the first place , and when two years ago it appeared that its rival , Thales , had won the competition to be prime , it channelled its fury into negotiating its way on to the top table as a project manager , shifting Thales to a design role . 
The MoD , however , would not demote Thales , and insisted on the two compa nies forming the alliance , with the MoD joining as mediator . 
BAE has flexed its muscles repeatedly , last year announcing the sale of its shipbuilding division in what many industry insiders interpreted as a negotiating tactic to ensure its influence in the program . 
Zafar Khan , analyst at SG Securities , says : ` The whole thing is now a bit of a mess . 
The problem is the buck will pass from one to the other . 
And then you get KBR on top of the whole thing , which has added a further layer of complexity . ' 
If nothing else , the carrier contract has demonstrated that BAE deploys tactics with the MoD that invite comparison with Halliburton 's at the Pentagon . 
Nevertheless , BAE 's protestations are echoed by other major UK companies . 
One source suggested that the real Halliburton agenda was to use the carrier contract as a wedge to break its way into the UK naval shipbuilding business , which has a full order book stretching out more than a decade and a half . 
` We do n't want to open up our numbers and details to KBR and Halliburton . 
There is unease about letting in a potential competitor and one that probably has another agenda , ' the source said . 
BAE , along with Portsmouth-based VT Group and Babcock , owner of the Rosyth dockyard in Fife , were all nervous when it became clear before Christmas that KBR had won because they suspected it wanted to take work into a disused oil platform yard at Nigg , further up the Scottish coast . 
The timing is doubly sensitive because the structure of UK shipbuilding is under review . 
The government and the industry are considering a consolidation of yards into one or two separate companies . 
Another senior industry figure says : ` The UK builders have suffered from the peaks and troughs of this industry , and now that there is the chance of a sustained peak there is incredulity at why the government is handing it to an outsider . ' 
He adds : ` If BAE pulls out and becomes a subcontractor , the project -LRB- due for completion between 2012 and 2015 -RRB- will be a disaster and will be late . ' 
Meanwhile , industry leaders suspect KBR may have over-promised on the carrier deal . ' 
I know exactly how they got it , ' says one . 
` Tony Pryor -LRB- head of KBR UK -RRB- went in and said `` Look , we 've built these oil platforms and they 're much bigger than the carrier , and that 's for starters . 
Of course we can do it . '' 
And he wowed them . ' 
Pryor was unavailable for interview last week , although KBR said it had proven expertise in working on complex major projects and pioneered the alliance approach to contracting . ' 
I saw the spec for the PI contract , ' says one executive . 
` It asked the PI to take all time and financial risk in return for managing the project and taking the margin . 
We said we could not do that , and I know the others did too , but KBR said okay . ' 
Now , he says , there is evidence that the original specifications have changed , and that KBR is set to win a three-month , # 5m deal to ` scope out ' the responsibilities on the program , before retendering for a longer term . 
` The key question is , what kind of risk will they be taking on when they renegotiate . 
They are very skilled at renegotiating that kind of thing . ' 
The implication in all of this is clear - that Halliburton sweet-talks governments into deals . 
Detractors have plenty of precedents to point to . 
KBR 's progenitor , Brown and Root , had close relations with president Lyndon Johnson stretching from his days as a Texan state politician and received contracts to supply logistical support in Vietnam and build dams in the US . 
Two decades later , KBR drew up the ` Logcap ' arrangements for US military logistical support . 
It went on to win the contract . 
But , with the PI contract up for re-tender , the question in the government 's mind will be , how good is KBR ? 
` The only thing you need to say is `` DML '' , ' says one detractor , referring to the company , majority-owned by KBR , that won the contract to build docks at Devonport for refitting nuclear submarines . 
The original # 576m cost of the project soared by 2002 to # 900m amid unclear responsibilities . 
A report by the National Audit Office found that DML had ` no experience of managing a major construction project that was subject to civil nuclear safety standards ' . 
Moreover , the NAO found that ` despite the stated allocation of risk in the contract , the MoD agreed to fund most of the cost increases ' . 
Detractors have to be careful . 
KBR has won a range of other projects , such as the armed forces Conlog contract -LRB- the UK equivalent of Logcap -RRB- , where it can demonstrate expertise . 
The NAO says it has no criticisms as yet of this , or any of the other recent deals KBR has won from government , ranging from NHS IT programs to road building . 
Indeed , one of its detractors admits , it has collaborated with KBR in other areas , such as road building , and the work has been good . 
` But there is a bit of a difference between a road and an aircraft carrier , ' he adds . 
Many point to the fact that to mitigate its asbestos liabilities , Halliburton placed KBR in US chapter 11 bankruptcy protection a year ago . 
Now its CEO Dave Lesar has said he wants to sell it . 
One well-connected Whitehall insideris baffled : ` The thing that puzzles me is why a company with this record , that is up for sale , that could be owned by anyone next month , is being put in charge of the most sensitive defense contract ever ? ' 
A cynic might respond that ministers hope Halliburton does sell KBR . 
Then it will be clear of the shadow of its Houston parent for good .

2005-02-08,"Tuesday 8 February 2005 00.02 GMT The head of the UN oil-for-food program in Iraq and a senior UN official who dealt with contracts for the program have been suspended following an independent investigation that accused them of misconduct , a UN spokesman said yesterday . 
Benon Sevan , who was in charge of the $ 64bn -LRB- # 34.5 bn -RRB- humanitarian program , and Joseph Stephanides , who heads the UN security council affairs division , were informed on Friday that they had been suspended with pay , UN spokesman Fred Eckhard said . 
Mr Sevan and Mr Stephanides were told they would receive a letter this week `` laying out the charges against them '' , which will allow them to defend themselves before UN disciplinary bodies in what will likely be a lengthy appeals process , he said . 
`` Suspension is the beginning of a disciplinary process , '' Mr Eckhard said . 
Mr Sevan ran the oil-for-food program from 1996 until it ended in November 2003 and retired from the UN last year but remains on the payroll for $ 1 a year to help with the investigation . 
Mr Stephanides is scheduled to retire in about five months . 
An investigation led by the former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker accused Mr Sevan in an interim report released last week of a `` grave conflict of interest '' , saying his conduct in soliciting oil deals from Iraq for a friend 's company was `` ethically improper and seriously undermined the integrity of the UN . '' 
Mr Volcker did not say that Mr Sevan received kickbacks , but expressed concern about the source of $ 160,000 -LRB- # 86,000 -RRB- in cash which Mr Sevan said he received from his aunt in Cyprus from 1999-2003 . 
The report questioned this `` unexplained wealth '' . 
Mr Volcker said he is still investigating `` the scope and extent of benefits '' that Mr Sevan received from his requests that a small Swiss-based oil company , African Middle East Petroleum , known as Amep , be given a chance to buy Iraqi oil . 
The company , run by a nephew of the former UN secretary general Boutros Boutros-Ghali , made a total profit of $ 1.5 m. Mr Sevan 's lawyer , Eric Lewis , accused Mr Volcker 's committee of trying to `` scapegoat '' him . 
In an attempt to curry favor and end sanctions , Saddam Hussein gave former government officials , activists , journalists and UN officials vouchers for Iraqi oil that could then be resold at a profit . 
Mr Volcker 's report found `` convincing and uncontested evidence '' that selection of the three UN contractors for the oil-for-food program did not conform to established financial and competitive bidding rules . 
Mr Annan has said that if any of Mr Volcker 's findings lead to criminal charges , he would cooperate with national law enforcement authorities and lift diplomatic immunity .

2005-02-14,"Monday 14 February 2005 13.32 GMT More than 50 journalists and media workers have been killed in Iraq in the last two years CNN 's top news executive has quit abruptly after 23 years following claims he accused US forces of deliberately targeting journalists in Iraq . 
Eason Jordan said he was resigning to prevent the news giant being `` unfairly tarnished '' by his remarks , which he claims were misinterpreted . 
`` After 23 years at CNN , I have decided to resign in an effort to prevent CNN from being unfairly tarnished by the controversy over conflicting accounts of my recent remarks regarding the alarming number of journalists killed in Iraq , '' Jordan told staff in a memo . 
`` I have devoted my professional life to helping make CNN the most trusted and respected news outlet in the world , and I would never do anything to compromise my work or that of the thousands of talented people it is my honor to work alongside . '' 
Jordan 's alleged remarks , made during a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum in Davos , caused a huge controversy after they were reported on the internet . 
CNN faced calls from bloggers to produce a transcript of the remarks and to fire its chief news executive if the accusations turned out to be true . 
Announcing his resignation on Friday , Jordan insisted he had never `` stated , believed or suspected that US military forces intended to kill people they knew to be journalists '' , but conceded that his comments `` were not as clear as they should have been '' . 
`` I never meant to imply US forces acted with ill intent when US forces accidentally killed journalists , and I apologise to anyone who thought I said or believed otherwise , '' he added . 
CNN 's president , Jim Walton , paid tribute to Jordan , saying he had `` served CNN and the pursuit of journalism with distinction '' . 
Jordan has lobbied the Pentagon to improve the safety of journalists in Iraq and other war zones where US forces are present . 
At a news conference last autumn he expressed frustration with the US authorities , saying there had been only a `` limited amount of progress '' , despite repeated meetings with news organizations . 
`` We hear good words but not the actions to back them up , '' he told an audience of news executives at the News Xchange conference in November . 
More than 50 journalists and media workers have been killed in Iraq since the US-led invasion nearly two years ago .

2005-02-14,"Monday 14 February 2005 17.14 GMT The first full day after Iraq 's election results were announced saw three Iraqi troops die in a roadside bomb , two Baghdad police shot dead in a drive-by shooting , an oil pipeline detonated and a woman and child killed by a mortar attack . 
As the newly elected politicians attempted to agree on a power sharing coalition behind closed doors - a process expected to last weeks - it was also reported that a kidnapped Swedish man had been threatened with decapitation by his purported hostage-takers . 
Meanwhile , in Washington the White House requested a supplementary $ 80bn -LRB- # 42bn -RRB- from Congress to fund the ongoing costs of military operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Around the world , leaders welcomed last night 's election results as a positive step in Iraq 's evolution . 
On the ground in Iraq , a roadside bomb killed three National Guards when it was detonated in Baqouba , 35 miles northeast of Baghdad , Mudafar Al-Juburi from the Dyala police station said . 
Three soldiers were wounded , he added . 
The oilfield attack occurred at the North Oil Company 's Al-Dibbis oilfield near Kirkuk , said Major General Anwar Mohammad Amin . 
The pipeline supplied oil for internal use and the damage will hamper the country 's oil production , he said . 
It would take workers at least three days to extinguish the blaze and repair the pipeline , Amin added . 
An insurgent mortar attack in Samarra , 60 miles north of Baghdad , killed a woman and a two-year-old girl , as well as injuring seven others , said Dr Alaa Al-Din Muhammed of Samarra Hospital . 
In Baghdad , gunmen firing from a car killed two high-ranking policemen on Sunday night , an interior ministry official said . 
He provided no other details . 
Insurgents also fired six mortars at a police station in central Baghdad , injuring three , police said . 
The violence comes after election officials announced the results of the January 30 elections . 
A Shia Muslim clergy-backed slate won 48 % of the votes and 140 of the 275 National Assembly seats , according to results released on Sunday in Baghdad . 
A Kurdish ticket got 26 % and 75 seats , while a secular Shia party won 40 seats . 
Nine parties divided the remaining 20 seats . 
The announcement of the election results , however , did nothing to slow down the violence . 
The kidnappers of a Swedish citizen have demanded a ransom for his freedom and threatened to decapitate him if they do n't receive it , a Stockholm radio station reported today . 
The kidnappers , who call themselves The Martyr al-Isawy Brigades , also want Sweden 's King Carl XVI Gustaf to take part in negotiations for the freedom of Minas Ibrahim al-Yousifi , the purported leader of the Christian Democratic Party in Iraq , his family told Radio Joenkoeping over the weekend . 
In Brussels , the European Union today congratulated the winners of the January 30 vote and urged them to ensure all Iraqis are represented during the drafting of a new constitution . 
`` The preliminary publication of results from Iraq 's first pluralist elections marks another step forward in Iraq 's political transition , '' Benita Ferrero-Waldner , EU external affairs commissioner , said . 
`` I trust they will ensure full representation of Iraq 's diverse society in the political process , and in particular in the drafting of the constitution , '' she added . 
Many world leaders were watching closely to see whether a deal could be struck that would avert ethnic and religious conflict and quell the raging insurgency . 
Japan , a vocal backer of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , said it was optimistic . 
`` There may be some issues such as how to balance different groups , regional issues , as well as the vote turnout , '' said chief cabinet secretary Hiroyuki Hosoda . 
`` But we expect that these will be solved as Iraq becomes stabilised . '' 
Others called on the incoming government to play fairly with minorities . 
New Zealand 's prime minister , Helen Clark , told the country 's Newstalk ZB radio station that those elected had to make sure the Iraqi government was `` inclusive '' . 
`` The key to Iraq 's future is going to be whether the largest group can accommodate satisfactorily the interests of the two smaller groups , the Sunnis and the Kurds , '' she said . 
But the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement that voter turnout in some regions was low and charged that there were `` imbalanced results '' in several regions , including Kirkuk . 
Turkey has long complained that Kurdish groups are illegally moving Kurds into Kirkuk , a strategic northern city , in an effort to tip the city 's population balance in their favor . 
"
2005-02-14,"Monday 14 February 2005 01.50 GMT Short of improbable developments in the courts , foxhunting will become illegal in England on Friday . 
Many people reading this will , no doubt , be pleased , but I suggest that the left might pause before gloating and wipe any smiles off their faces . 
This is a very nasty piece of political work indeed and what it says about the Labor party is truly horrible . 
By now all the arguments about hunting have been exhausted , but one point needs to be made for one last time . 
Hunting is morally indefensible in strict ethical terms , but no more so than angling , which is in some ways more objectionable . 
There is , of course , the supra-ethical difference that only a quarter of a million people hunt , very few of them Labor voters , whereas 4 million people fish , and their votes are desperately needed by the government , not to say by individual Labor MPs . 
Attempts to explain this away have a wonderfully hollow ring . 
Alun Michael , the minister responsible for passing the hunting ban , has said the only tests that matter are `` cruelty and utility '' . 
Alan Milburn has been recalled to the government to mastermind the election campaign and has said on the radio , with an audible smirk , that hunting is different from fishing because foxes ca n't be eaten . 
Even he may be aware that by far the largest part of recreational fishing in this country is what is called competition angling , catching harmless and specifically inedible coarse fish by sheer volume . 
This pastime has neither culinary nor environmental justification of any kind , and has been called pure sadism . 
Let me leave it there , while asking Michael , Milburn or any other member of the government to defend competition angling in terms of cruelty and utility . 
All this is by the way , since everyone must recognize by now that the hunting controversy long ago took on a life of its own and ceased to be debated in any real terms of right or wrong . 
Its true importance lies the role it has come to play in Labor politics , and above all in the squalid , and frankly humiliating , relationship between Tony Blair and his party . 
For Labor MPs , hunting has become a displacement activity , a means in which they try to persuade themselves - against all evidence - that they still belong to a radical movement . 
For the government it has been a vital sop to buy off discontent in the ranks , up to and including the most appalling betrayal of what the party once stood for . 
It is of real historical significance that this ban has not come about under what anyone can honestly call a government of the left . 
By any objective standards , New Labor is a centre-right party , and it is hard to argue with Martin Jacques when he says that Blair personally stands to the right of every postwar prime minister apart from his heroine , Margaret Thatcher . 
Hence , in its roundabout way , the importance of this one irrelevant issue . 
Hence also the way that political defences of the ban backfire . 
The Labor MP Peter Bradley has said that it `` is not about the politics of envy but the politics of power '' . 
This was misrepresented by the Tory press as a declaration of class war . 
Others , too , were happy to pick up his torch : `` There 's nothing like a bit of class war , '' said one Guardian writer . 
This is n't class war as Kautsky and Lenin understood it , or Hardie and Bevan . 
Let us never forget the guiding principle of our present rulers : `` New Labor is intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich . '' 
No one could accuse Peter Mandelson of ambiguity when he said that , nor deny that his party has lived up to that precept . 
The Blair government worships money and adores the rich , something Labor MPs try ineffectually to disguise when they attack the traditional -LRB- though long since eclipsed -RRB- values and mores of the old gentry . 
Class conflict has given way to `` culture wars '' , and hunting is a cultural and not a political question . 
It certainly has nothing to do with left and right , unless one were to suppose that the `` Blairite loyalist '' and fanatical exponent of the hunting ban Sir Gerald Kaufman is further to the left of that hard man to hounds Friedrich Engels , which does n't seem very likely . 
All that is overshadowed by Blair 's sordid dealings with the party he leads but which has never really liked him . 
When the prime minister returned from sojourning in Bermuda last year to announce his ludicrous volte-face on the European referendum , he is supposed to have told a colleague : `` I 'm going to have a lot of shit to eat '' . 
Maybe so , but nothing compared with the diet he has imposed on his party for the past 10 years , that mighty coprophagic banquet , that great orgy of ordure . 
Over and again , and to a degree quite unprecedented in political history , Labor MPs have been ordered to support ministers they despised and vote for measures they have detested . 
The cut in benefit for single parents mattered much less economically than psychologically . 
With that , Blair showed that he had completely broken the will of his MPs , who would thereafter accept anything - even a war that almost none of them wanted . 
At the same time , hunting was brought back at regular intervals to propitiate the resentful and self-hating parliamentary party . 
Many people , among them Jackie Ashley and Polly Toynbee on these pages , have asked the same thing : why on earth was so much time spent on hunting when parliament had so many more important questions to deal with ? 
But that has been answered by another eminent political journalist . 
For those who do n't know the figures , by the way , more than 700 hours of parliamentary time were devoted to the hunting ban , as against seven hours spent on the decision to invade Iraq , a comparison that sums up the way we are governed . 
On the evening the ban was passed , Martha Kearney on Newsnight described the political background , and the government 's motives last year in taking up the hunting bill once again . 
As she said quite matter-of-factly , `` it was brought back to restore morale after the war in Iraq '' . 
So there you have it . 
This was a crust thrown to Labor MPs to thank them for supporting an unnecessary , illegal and immoral war , which Blair took this country into simply to demonstrate his uncritical loyalty to the most reactionary American president in living memory , and which has killed at least 20,000 and possibly 100,000 innocent people . 
As the election approaches , with a further drop in turn-out all too likely , politicians are wondering why they are so widely despised . 
Here is their answer . 
Blair got his war , Labor got their hunting ban . 
I hope it makes them all happy .

2005-02-17,"Thursday 17 February 2005 01.49 GMT American soldiers traumatised by fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan are to be offered the drug ecstasy to help free them of flashbacks and recurring nightmares . 
The US food and drug administration has given the go-ahead for the soldiers to be included in an experiment to see if MDMA , the active ingredient in ecstasy , can treat post-traumatic stress disorder . 
Scientists behind the trial in South Carolina think the feelings of emotional closeness reported by those taking the drug could help the soldiers talk about their experiences to therapists . 
Several victims of rape and sexual abuse with post-traumatic stress disorder , for whom existing treatments are ineffective , have been given MDMA since the research began last year . 
Michael Mithoefer , the psychiatrist leading the trial , said : `` It 's looking very promising . 
It 's too early to draw any conclusions but in these treatment-resistant people so far the results are encouraging . 
`` People are able to connect more deeply on an emotional level with the fact they are safe now . '' 
He is about to advertise for war veterans who fought in the last five years to join the study . 
According to the US national center for post-traumatic stress disorder , up to 30 % of combat veterans suffer from the condition at some point in their lives . 
Known as shell shock during the first world war and combat fatigue in the second , the condition is characterised by intrusive memories , panic attacks and the avoidance of situations which might force sufferers to relive their wartime experiences . 
Dr Mithoefer said the MDMA helped people discuss traumatic situations without triggering anxiety . 
`` It appears to act as a catalyst to help people move through whatever 's been blocking their success in therapy . '' 
The existing drug-assisted therapy sessions last up to eight hours , during music is played . 
The patients swallow a capsule containing a placebo or 125mg of MDMA - about the same or a little more than a typical ecstasy tablet . 
Psychologists assess the patients before and after the trial to judge whether the drug has helped . 
The study has provoked controversy , because significant doubts remain about the long-term risks of ecstasy . 
Animal studies suggest that it lowers levels of the brain chemical serotonin , and some politicians and anti-drug campaigners have argued that research into possible medical benefits of illegal drugs presents a falsely reassuring message . 
The South Carolina study marks a resurgence of interest in the use of controlled psychedelic and hallucinogenic drugs . 
Several studies in the US are planned or are under way to investigate whether MDMA , LSD and psilocybin , the active ingredient in magic mushrooms , can treat conditions ranging from obsessive compulsive disorder to anxiety in terminal cancer patients . 
-LRB- - i think that 's unfair , he was a kid , no ? 
For the paedo stuff he was a powerful adult .

2005-02-18,"Photographs of detainees being sexually humiliated Friday 18 February 2005 02.35 GMT New evidence has emerged that US forces in Afghanistan engaged in widespread Abu Ghraib-style abuse , taking `` trophy photographs '' of detainees and carrying out rape and sexual humiliation . 
Documents obtained by the Guardian contain evidence that such abuses took place in the main detention center at Bagram , near the capital Kabul , as well as at a smaller US installation near the southern city of Kandahar . 
The documents also indicate that US soldiers covered up abuse in Afghanistan and in Iraq - even after the Abu Ghraib scandal last year . 
A thousand pages of evidence from US army investigations released to the American Civil Liberties Union after a long legal battle , and made available to the Guardian , show that an Iraqi detained at Tikrit in September 2003 was forced to withdraw his report of abuse after soldiers told him he would be held indefinitely . 
Meanwhile , photographs taken in southern Afghanistan showing US soldiers from the 22nd Infantry Battalion posing in mock executions of blindfolded and bound detainees , were purposely destroyed after the Abu Ghraib scandal to avoid `` another public outrage '' , the documents show . 
In the dossier , the Iraqi detainee claims that three US interrogators in civilian clothing dislocated his arms , stuck an unloaded gun in his mouth and pulled the trigger , choked him with a rope until he lost consciousness , and beat him with a baseball bat . 
`` After they tied me up in the chair , then they dislocate my both arms . 
He asked to admit before I kill you then he beat again and again , '' the prisoner says in his statement . 
`` He asked me : Are you going to report me ? 
You have no evidence . 
Then he hit me very hard on my nose , and then he stepped on my nose until he broken and I started bleeding . '' 
The detainee withdrew his charges on November 23 2003 . 
He says he was told : `` You will stay in the prison for a long time , and you will never get out until you are 50 years old . '' 
A medical examination by a US military doctor confirmed the detainee 's account , yet the investigation was closed last October . 
`` It is further proof that the army is not seriously investigating credible allegations of abuse , '' said Jameel Jaffar , a lawyer for the ACLU . 
The latest allegations from Afghanistan fit a pattern of claims of brutal treatment made by former Guantnamo Bay prisoners and Afghans held by the US , and reported by the Guardian last year . 
In December the US said eight prisoners had died in its custody in Afghanistan . 
In a separate case , which the Guardian reveals today , two former prisoners of the US in Afghanistan have come forward with claims against their American captors . 
In sworn affidavits to a British-American human rights lawyer , a Palestinian says he was sodomised by American soldiers in Afghanistan . 
Another former prisoner of US forces , a Jordanian , describes a form of torture which involved being hung in a cage from a rope for days . 
Both men were freed from US detention last year after being held in Afghanistan and Guantnamo Bay . 
Neither has been charged by any government with any offence . 
Hussain Adbulkadr Youssouf Mustafa , a Palestinian living in Jordan , told the lawyer , Clive Stafford-Smith , that he was sodomised by US soldiers during his detention at Bagram air force base in 2002 . 
He claims to have been blindfolded , tightly handcuffed , gagged and had his ears plugged , forced to bend down over a table by two soldiers , with a third soldier pressing his face down on the table , and to have had his trousers pulled down . 
`` They forcibly rammed a stick up my rectum , '' he reports . 
`` It was excruciatingly painful ... Only when the pain became overwhelming did I think I would ever scream . 
But I could not stop screaming when this happened . '' 
In a second affidavit , the Jordanian citizen , Wesam Abdulrahman Ahmed Al Deemawi , detained from March 15 2002 to March 31 2004 , says that during a 40-day period of detention at Bagram he was threatened with dogs , stripped and photographed `` in shameful and obscene positions '' and placed in a cage with a hook and a hanging rope . 
He says he was hung from this hook , blindfolded , for two days although he was occasionally given hour-long `` breaks '' . 
The Guardian asked the US military 's central command , which has responsibility for Afghanistan , to respond to the allegations on Wednesday . 
By the time of going to press last night no response had been received other than an email from a Major Steven Wollman in Kabul , saying he was researching the question .

2005-02-20,"Call it what you like - this is hell Mark Danner exposes the double speak that underpins Bush 's ` war on terror ' in Torture and Truth . 
Peter Conrad on how America 's response to 9\/11 unleashed an obscene nightmare Five days after 9\/11 , Vice-President Cheney emerged from the fortified burrow in which he 'd been awaiting Armageddon and - glowering as blackly as the oil he no doubt dreams of - explained how the government intended to respond to the terrorists . 
President Bush was already babbling about a crusade and remembering the ` dead or alive ' posters that used to be displayed in the Wild West . 
But Cheney did not invoke the chivalric idealism of Arthurian knights and sheriffs with tin badges . 
The fictions that helped him to deal with these new political facts were demon-haunted and apocalyptic . 
He had cast himself as Darth Vader : he therefore explained to an NBC interviewer that the administration from now on would ` work through , sort of , the dark side ' . 
That meant , as it turned out , the suspension of habeas corpus and of the Geneva conventions that regulate the treatment of prisoners of war . 
Alberto Gonzalez , Bush 's legal counsel -LRB- since promoted to attorney general -RRB- , supplied him with a ` new paradigm ' for conducting a campaign against rogue killers from failed states who targeted civilians : since terrorists ignored the laws , why should America and its raggle-taggle band of allies bother about humane niceties ? 
Last year , when the photographs of detainees at Abu Ghraib being sexually shamed or threatened by dogs were published , the ` dark side ' was placed on view in bright , brash color . 
An investigation revealed that torture was being used to obtain confessions . 
One zealous American soldier , symbolically outfitted in his full uniform , had even sodomised a prisoner ; unfortunately the man was too busy screaming to divulge any information of value . 
Other Americans did their anal interrogating with broomsticks or chemical lights , or brought in dogs to do the job for them . 
Bush , testily insisting that his henchmen had been instructed to do nothing illegal , said : ` We have laws on the books . ' 
What this meant was expensive lawyers were busy devising methods of circumventing those laws . 
An article in a recent New Yorker describes the vogue for outsourcing torture . 
Suspects abducted by the CIA are loaded in shackles onto executive jets , and delivered to countries such as Egypt , Syria and Jordan whose secret police have robust ways of asking questions . 
Mark Danner - toiling through official reports and transcripts of interviews with prisoners and witnesses , as well as conducting his own investigation in Iraq - has exposed the false piety in disavowals of responsibility by Bush and Donald Rumsfeld , and established official complicity in the abuse . 
The moral corruption began , of course , from the obfuscation of language . 
It 's easy to lie if you muddle up the definition of truth ; abominable acts can be made defensible if you call them by another name . 
No one in Apocalypse Now tells Willard to murder Kurtz . 
They simply say that the colonel 's command must be ` terminated ' , and when the assassin blinks uncomprehending they add that the termination must occur ` with extreme prejudice ' . 
The military bureaucrats on whom Danner eavesdrops employ the same elevated , evasive diction . 
A colonel justifies the use of ` sleep deprivation ' at Guantnamo by saying that such measures are ` probably within the lexicon ' . 
That mental torment thus becomes a mere word , a quaint lexical curio . 
From there it 's a short step to the paraphrase employed at Abu Ghraib , where keeping cells lit 24 hours a day is called ` sleep adjustment ' , as if it were therapeutic . 
The CIA specialises in such neologisms . 
Beatings , for instance , are glossed as ` enhanced interrogation techniques ' : imagine how your life would be enhanced by a battery of fists , whips and cattle prods . 
Such enhancement is a privilege , lavished only on guests whom the agency classifies as its ` high value detainees ' . 
Jargon is anesthetic ; it stops your ears to the cries of your victims , and like a beta blocker suppresses whatever humane sensitivity you may still possess . 
Thus the torturers , theorising about ` prisoner-guard interactions ' , could describe themselves as artists who competed with each other to devise more ` creative ' forms of aggression . 
Danner 's documents reveal what that creativity entailed . 
It had become banal , when ` fearing up ' detainees , to see them piss themselves in terror . 
Such victories were facile , so a prize was awarded to whoever could make a man defecate by threatening him . 
Detainees were handcuffed together , then ordered them to crawl on the floor while being choked or hosed down or pummelled . 
The thugs who supervised the revels imagined they were making music : a report on one such session names the soldiers by whom it was ` orchestrated ' . 
Latinate terminology is useful because it remains unintelligible . 
Slang also comes in handy , since it 's a terse shorthand whose precise meaning is unfixed , not yet inscribed in the lexicon . 
A lieutenant-colonel , taking delivery of four Iraqi generals , ordered a corporal to ` Strip them out and PT them ' . 
Did stripping out mean denuding them , or placing them in isolation ? 
PT is physical training : did that prescribe gymnastics or a punch-up ? 
The vagueness of the order , as a report concluded , ` could have led to any subsequent abuse ' . 
But it could hardly be abusive , since its purpose was to ` soften up ' the detainees . 
Is n't softness synonymous with clemency and kindness ? 
Accusations of wrongdoing lose their force because words have been so bled of meaning . 
A report decides that ` the use of nudity was sanctioned at some level within the chain of command ' . 
But ` sanction ' gestures towards sanctity . 
Used to approve torture , it ca n't help sanctifying the torturer . 
Half way through 500 pages of such brain-befuddling gobbledegook , Danner inserts eight pages of photographs - the cheery holiday snaps of Private Lyndie Englund and her gloating , sadistic cronies , who have piled up naked Iraqis into pyramids ` for the fun of it ' or smeared them in shit or paraded them so that their fearfully shrivelled penises can be laughed at . 
James Schlesinger , the former defense secretary , disposed of this obscene album by referring to a comic film : Abu Ghraib , he said , was ' Animal House on the nightshift ' . 
But these were not the frat-house rampages of John Belushi and his swinish , beer-swilling buddies . 
Danner prefers a loftier cultural reference , and says that the detainees were put through a ` Dantesque nightmare journey ' . 
For me , it all looks less like Dante 's inferno than the coprophiliac hell imagined by Bosch : a pornotopia where bowel movements are the answers to barked questions , and prisoners after being half-drowned in vats of urine are told to lap up meals that have been dumped in the toilet . 
The images , foul as they are , come as a relief after so much verbose hypocrisy . 
Bush may prate about the gospel of freedom , but Danner quotes an Iraqi who says that the American liberators have merely brought ` the freedom of rape , the freedom of nudity and the freedom of humiliation ' . 
Torture was supposed to extract truth from the captives . 
Truth , however , was the first casualty of this unending and ineffectual war .

2005-02-20,"Flirting with Armageddon : welcome to a new arms race The threat of nuclear strikes is now greater than during the Cold War , report Paul Harris in New York and Jason Burke in London Sunday 20 February 2005 12.35 GMT It was 1.22 am last Monday on the frozen Alaskan island of Kodiak when the missile flared upwards into the night sky . 
As the rocket 's flames disappeared into darkness , United States military chiefs waited with bated breath to see if their multibillion dollar ` Son of Star Wars ' defense shield would work . 
Thousands of miles away on the Pacific island of Kwajalein another missile was primed to intercept the Alaskan launch , soaring to destroy its target in the upper atmosphere and thus ` save America from nuclear devastation ' . 
It never made it . 
On Kwajalein metal supports holding the interceptor rocket failed to disengage . 
If it had been real the enemy nuke would have hit its target . 
The system has now failed in six out of nine tests . 
Many experts believe it simply does not work . 
But this does not deter the Pentagon . 
It is in a frenzy to put a missile shield around America . 
The threat from nuclear attack is now once more at the center of strategic planning . 
The missile defense shield is not seen as a throwback but as a vital part of defense . 
Nuclear weapons too remain in US plans , it is now looking at developing a whole new range of ` bunker buster ' nukes . 
A new nuclear arms race is gripping the world . 
Many experts believe the likelihood of such an attack is greater now than it was during the Cold War . 
North Korea has already claimed it has nuclear weapons , Iran could be on the brink of building them . 
Both nations could trigger arms races among their neighbors . 
The international system set up to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons has sprung a series of leaks . 
UN Secretary General Kofi Annan has warned of a ` cascade ' of states going nuclear . 
But that might not even be the biggest threat . 
Behind the ambitions and fears of nations lurk terrorist networks bent on acquiring weapons . 
Few doubt the most extreme groups would love to use them . 
It is a bleak picture that makes the Cold War look almost safe . 
` We are in an extremely dangerous time right now , ' said Natalie Goldring , a proliferation expert at the University of Maryland . 
At the moment the world 's nuclear club is eight strong . 
There are the original big five of the US , China , Russia , Britain and France and three newcomers of India , Pakistan and Israel . 
That has now changed . 
If the pronouncements coming out of Pyongyang are to be believed , the reclusive and impoverished Stalinist state of North Korea has now become the club 's newest member . 
Some disbelieve the official rhetoric . 
North Korea is desperate for foreign aid and wants face-to-face talks with America . 
It is possible that this latest move is just a bluff . ' 
I would not take anything the North Koreans say at face value , ' said Paul Leventhal , president of the Nuclear Control Institute . 
But most experts accept such sentiments afford little comfort . 
Now the focus of dealing with North Korea has become working out what sort of nuclear devices North Korea might possess and how it could deliver them . 
Though it has no missiles that could reach America , South Korea lies just over the border . 
Tokyo is just a short flight over the Sea of Japan . 
It could easily use a plane or a boat to deliver a nuclear device . 
That could see the triggering of a regional nuclear arms race in Asia , a continent already scarred by the nuclear standoff between Indian and Pakistan . 
With North Korea boasting a nuclear arsenal , South Korea is under enormous pressure to follow suit as a deterrent . 
Japan too could see nuclear weapons as its only insurance against assault . 
With its hi-tech economy many people believe Japan could develop weapons in a matter of weeks or months , not years . 
But if this happens then China , motivated by longstanding fears over its advanced neighbor , will likely move to increase its own nuclear weapons arsenal and develop more advanced delivery systems . 
Suddenly , the nuclear club will start to look very crowded . 
Certainly Iran appears to want to join despite intensive diplomacy from a trio of European nations . 
Many experts put that down to a failure of US policy . 
Iran 's leaders have looked at the contrasting fates of Iraq , which was invaded for weapons it did not have , and North Korea , which has confessed to developing nuclear weapons and now appears immune to any military threat . 
With the Bush administration openly bent on ` regime change ' in Iran , the safest route for the country 's reigning mullahs seems obvious . 
` Iran has learned that lesson . 
They want to go the North Korea route , not the Iraq route , ' Goldring said . 
That has led to a dangerous game of brinkmanship in a Middle East destined to become a theater of conflict where nuclear weapons are suddenly a real possibility . 
Israel already has the bomb . 
Iran , surrounded by American allies and soldiers , wants it too . 
Some experts think it is too late to stop Iran from going nuclear , no matter how many official denials Tehran puts out about its intentions . 
Others believe there is still hope . 
` We need to make a concerted effort and engage with the process , ' said Peter Pella , a former proliferation expert at the US State Department . 
The Bush administration is taking an opposite tack . 
In an international version of ` good cop , bad cop ' European nations are holding discussions with Iran about its nuclear program , while the US makes hostile noises . 
Few experts failed to notice Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice 's recent remarks that attacking Iran was ' ... not on the agenda at this point ' . 
That has some US hawks on the Iranian situation delighted . 
` We need a stick to use , ' said Leventhal . 
` The Europeans will have heard the ` not on the agenda ' part , but the Iranians will have head the ` at this point ' part . ' 
Whatever the approach , few believe that the Iranian nuclear issue is anything but a potentially catastrophic powder keg . 
If Iran pushes ahead , then Israel could launch strikes against possible nuclear facilities , just as it did in Iraq in the 1980s . 
Such a move could easily ignite a major war across the region . 
The crisis is brewing to a boil and no real solution is yet in sight . 
But the nuclear threat of the 21st century comes from terrorist groups , not just rogue states . 
It is no longer governments who are the most likely to spread nukes or the technology to make them . 
And it is no longer states who are most likely to use them . 
Militants such as Osama bin Laden have said that they would use nuclear weapons . 
Al-Qaeda are known to have acquired plans for the manufacture of nuclear arms . 
Intelligence services know meetings occurred between al-Qaeda representatives and nuclear scientists before 11 September . 
Islamic militants have since negotiated to buy what they thought was weapons-grade uranium from criminals . 
` The intent is there , ' said one Western intelligence source . 
` The question is whether any militant organization - particularly one that is being chased by the most powerful nation in the world - could build the facilities to create and weaponise a nuclear armament , even some kind of `` suitcase bomb '' style device . 
The answer is `` probably no '' . ' 
Instead , most experts agree , the main threat comes from a basic radiological device - or dirty bomb . 
This would be a conventional bomb laced with radioactive material - perhaps only an element from a hospital x-ray machine . 
According to a report to be published next week by the British American Security Information Council , the radiological impact of a dirty bomb is uncertain . 
In 1987 the Iraqi army tested a large radiological bomb for possible use in the Iran-Iraq war , but abandoned the plan because the radiation levels produced were not considered high enough . 
But dirty bombs do have two advantages for terrorists . 
First , they could cause widespread panic and chaos . 
Second , the cost of the cleanup , and the implications of having large parts of a city center rendered unusable , would be massive . 
There are also fears that North Korea or Iran may give nuclear technology to militants , or rogue scientists selling secrets or nuclear materials . 
A recent example is that of Abdul Qadeer Khan , the father of Pakistan 's nuclear program , who reportedly made himself a fortune of more than $ 400m in a 15 year career of selling nuclear secrets to North Korea , Libya and , quite possibly , Iran . 
Working through scores of offshore accounts and cut-out companies , Khan 's network stretched from South Africa to Morocco to Singapore . 
Turkish and Malaysian workshops made parts for centrifuges , Italian factories made furnaces , a German supplier provided vacuum pumps . 
Though the CIA have claimed they had penetrated the network , it is still thought Khan was able to visit North Korea more than a dozen times to swap Pakistani centrifuge technology for local missile know-how , pass uranium enrichment technology to Iran and to give Libya blue prints for a bomb . 
There are dangers everywhere . 
Many fear General Pervaiz Musharraf 's pro-Western government in Pakistan , which already has the bomb , could be replaced by a harder line Islamic regime . 
And there are problems with former Soviet stocks . 
Russia alone has hundreds of metric tonnes of weapons grade materials such as enriched uranium . 
The prospect of a nuclear attack by terrorists on a Western city is more possible now than at any time . 
` If a nuclear weapon went off in a city somewhere , it would not surprise me at all , ' said Leventhal . 
It is not all doom and gloom . 
Libya has come in from the diplomatic cold , giving up its nuclear ambitions . 
And there is now little possibility of a nuclear-armed Iraq threatening the Middle East . 
But in general the situation looks bleak . 
It has been more than 30 years since the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was created . 
It was designed to discourage nations from developing nuclear weapons in return for access to nuclear power and an obligation on behalf of the big powers to work towards nuclear disarmament . 
The treaty will be reviewed this May in New York at a time when it seems no one is abiding by it . 
It is likely that the issue of Iran will dominate the meeting . 
One senior Western European diplomat told The Observer the atmosphere was likely to be ` poisoned ' by the acrimonious debate over policy towards Tehran . 
` It is a treaty concerned not only with stopping the further spread of nukes but also about their complete elimination , ' said Dr Stephen Pullinger , of Saferworld , an independent foreign affairs think tank . 
` Instead , it is clear that none of the five declared nuclear states are thinking about abandoning their nukes for the foreseeable future . ' 
As Iran and North Korea stand in the dock in May it may well be worth remembering the Non-Proliferation was meant to work both ways .

2005-02-21,"Monday 21 February 2005 16.17 GMT George Bush delivers a speech in Brussels in which he calls for a new era of transatlantic unity with the goal of spreading democracy across the Middle East . 
Photograph : AP\/Kevin Lamarque The US president , George Bush , today warned Syria to end its occupation of Lebanon as he put reform in the Middle East at the center of his vision for the transatlantic alliance . 
In a Brussels speech billed as a conciliatory gesture to EU leaders after the divisions of the Iraq war , Mr Bush said it was time for Europe and the US to work together to `` to take up the duties of great democracies '' . 
The Middle East and the Muslim world from Egypt to Afghanistan dominated the address . 
The president said peace between Israel and the Palestinians was `` our immediate goal '' and insisted that Iran `` must not develop nuclear weapons '' . 
He called on the EU to support the `` world 's newest democracy '' in Iraq . 
Mr Bush said democratic regimes in the region were the key to wider peace and stability for Europe and the US , telling his audience that the `` future of our nations and the future of the Middle East are linked '' . 
His call for Syria to withdraw from the territory of its tiny neighbor came as it was reported the Syrian president , Bashar al-Assad , had said Damascus would take steps to pull its troops out of the country in accordance with the Taif agreement that ended Lebanon 's 1975-90 civil war . 
Syria has been under pressure over Lebanon since opposition politicians blamed Damascus for the assassination last week of the former prime minister Rafik Hiriri . 
Mr Bush also called for Lebanese elections taking place in the spring to be without Syrian interference . 
Syria and Iran last week announced a `` common front '' as Washington ratcheted up its rhetoric against them . 
Mr Bush began his speech joking that Condoleezza Rice had told him to be a `` realist '' about the reception he would get in Brussels , but he was greeted with applause when he said the US wanted to see Israeli and Palestinian states living side by side in peace and security . 
He said the `` greatest opportunity and ... immediate goal '' of a US-EU alliance was an end to the Middle East conflict . 
`` The world must not rest until there is a just and lasting resolution to this conflict , '' he told the audience . 
`` We seek peace between Israel and Palestine for its own sake . 
We also know that a free and peaceful Palestine can add to the momentum of reform throughout the broader Middle East . '' 
Mr Bush said the lesson of post-war European history was that rivals could become partners and that Washington supported a strong and united Europe `` because we need a strong partner in the hard work of advancing freedom in the world '' . 
He said the US and western Europe shared a history of fighting tyranny in the second world war and in the democratisation of central and eastern Europe in the years after 1989 and the two needed to begin `` a new era of transatlantic unity '' . 
Mr Bush will meet with the three key opponents of the Iraq war - the French , German , and Russian leaders , Jacques Chirac , Gerhard Schrder and Vladimir Putin - on his five day visit to Belgium , Germany and Slovakia . 
He may have strong words for Mr Putin , whom he today urged to ensure Russia stayed true to democratic principles and the rule of law . 
He said the EU must put democratic reform at the heart of its dialogue with Russia . 
In a move sure to please Mr Bush , EU foreign ministers are today expected to approve the funding of a Baghdad office to coordinate the training of Iraqi judges and prosecutors . 
US aides expressed hope that Mr Bush 's European visit would lead to a cooler transatlantic dialogue . 
He will dine later today with Mr Chirac , one of his most outspoken critics on the Iraq war . 
The EU may be cooperating with the US on Iraq but divisions remain over how to confront Iran about its nuclear programs and an EU proposal to end a 15-year arms embargo on China . 
Mr Bush 's trip will see the tightest and largest security operation ever mounted in the countries he is visiting . 
Several thousand police were on duty in Brussels last night , almost double the quota deployed during EU summits , as hundreds of demonstrators staged the first of several planned protests .

2005-02-22,"The Ukrainian president , Viktor Yushchenko , speaks at today 's Nato summit in Brussels . 
Photograph : Getty Images The Ukrainian president , Viktor Yushchenko , confirmed today at a Nato summit attended by George Bush that the former Soviet country wants to become a member of the transatlantic organization . 
The announcement is likely to heighten Moscow 's concern that Ukraine 's new western-leaning president will try to take the country out of Russia 's sphere of influence . 
Mr Yushchenko confirmed his intention at a news conference following a Nato summit at the organizations headquarters in Brussels to which Ukraine was invited . 
During the meeting he had appealed to alliance leaders to back his moves for deeper relations between Nato and his country . 
`` The changes in Ukraine open the way to elevate relations with the alliance , '' he said . 
Before the summit , Mr Yushchenko met the US president , who is on the second day of a three-nation visit to Europe which has been interpreted as an attempt to mend fences following the rift caused by the US-led invasion of Iraq . 
`` Ukraine should be welcomed by the Europe Atlantic family , '' Mr Bush said yesterday . 
But Mr Yuschenko also sought to reassure Russia about his Nato ambitions . 
Ukraine was bitterly divided by last year 's presidential election crisis involving Mr Yushchenko and the pro-Kremlin candidate and then prime minister Viktor Yanukovich . 
`` Russia is our strategic partner , '' he said today . 
`` Ukrainian policy toward Nato will not , by any means , be directed against Russia or any other country . '' 
The alliance members also discussed the broader future of Nato following reports that the French president , Jacques Chirac , had backed a controversial recent call by the German chancellor , Gerhard Schrder , to question whether Nato was still the ideal primary forum for transatlantic dialogue . 
Mr Bush has rebuffed the idea of revamping Nato and said earlier today that the organization was `` a vital relationship to the United States and Europe '' . 
However , according to notes released by Mr Chirac 's aides , the French president told the summit : `` We must also , as the German chancellor has underlined , continue to take account of the changes that have occurred on the European continent ... Europe and the United States are real partners . 
So we need to dialogue and listen to each other more . '' 
During the summit , Mr Bush won a long-sought Nato commitment for more training aid to build up Iraqi security . 
Analysts said the contribution was modest but Mr Bush said `` every contribution helps '' . 
The US military has estimated that 136,000 Iraqi military , police and national guardsmen have been trained and equipped , which is fewer than half the ultimate goal of a force of about 270,000 , a goal seen as pivotal in freeing up coalition forces to leave . 
Day two of Bush 's visit to Europe Earlier Mr Bush had breakfast with the prime minister , Tony Blair , who paid tribute to Mr Bush 's leadership in the Middle East , saying there was a real prospect of peace in the region . 
Both leaders emphasised the importance of transatlantic ties . 
Mr Blair said there was a chance for a stable , prosperous and democratic Iraq and a `` real solid basis now for going forward in a unified way '' . 
At the beginning of his trip yesterday , Mr Bush made a speech in Brussels in which he appealed to Europe over the Middle East , climate change and the common values of the two continents . 
He declared that the US stood `` proudly '' in the tradition of the Magna Carta and the Declaration of the Rights of Man . 
Today , Mr Blair praised the president 's speech , describing it as setting out a `` very clear way forward for us now , whatever the differences in the international community there have been over the last couple of years '' . 
Last night , Mr Bush dined with Mr Chirac , who opposed the war in Iraq . 
Mr Chirac said US-French relations had been excellent for 200 years and the Iraq war had not changed that After traveling to Germany tomorrow , Mr Bush will visit Slovakia to meet the Russian president , Vladimir Putin , on Thursday . 
Mr Bush had some critical words for the Russian leader yesterday , suggesting that he was backsliding on democracy . 
`` I 've got a good relationship with Vladimir . 
I intend to keep it that way , '' Mr Bush said . 
`` But , as well , I intend to remind him that if his interests lie west , that -LRB- the United States and its allies -RRB- share values , and those values are important . '' 
Russia 's foreign minister , Sergei Lavrov , who is currently in Brussels , ignored Mr Bush 's criticisms .

2005-02-23,"Wednesday 23 February 2005 12.14 GMT A US tank moves into position near Iraq 's western border . 
Photograph : Adam Butler\/AP The attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , warned less than two weeks before the invasion of Iraq that military action could be ruled illegal . 
The government was so concerned that it might be prosecuted it set up a team of lawyers to prepare for legal action in an international court . 
And a parliamentary answer issued days before the war in the name of Lord Goldsmith - but presented by ministers as his official opinion before the crucial Commons vote - was drawn up in Downing Street , not in the attorney general 's chambers . 
The full picture of how the government manipulated the legal justification for war , and political pressure placed on its most senior law officer , is revealed in the Guardian today . 
It appears that Lord Goldsmith never wrote an unequivocal formal legal opinion that the invasion was lawful , as demanded by Lord Boyce , chief of defense staff at the time . 
The Guardian can also disclose that in her letter of resignation in protest against the war , Elizabeth Wilmshurst , deputy legal adviser at the Foreign Office , described the planned invasion of Iraq as a `` crime of aggression '' . 
She said she could not agree to military action in circumstances she described as `` so detrimental to the international order and the rule of law '' . 
Her uncompromising comments , and disclosures about Lord Goldsmith 's relations with ministers in the run-up to war , appear in a book by Philippe Sands , a QC in Cherie Booth 's Matrix chambers and professor of international law at University College London . 
Exclusive extracts of his book Lawless World are published in today 's Guardian . 
Lord Goldsmith warned Tony Blair in a document on March 7 2003 that the use of force against Iraq could be illegal . 
It would be safer to have a second UN resolution explicitly sanctioning military action . 
`` So concerned was the government about the possibility of such a case that it took steps to put together a legal team to prepare for possible international litigation , '' writes Mr Sands . 
The government has refused to publish the March 7 document . 
It was circulated to only a very few senior ministers . 
All Lord Goldsmith gave the cab inet was a later oral presentation of a parliamentary answer issued under his name on March 17 . 
This appears contrary to the official ministerial code , which states that the complete text of opinions by the government 's law officers should be seen by the full cabinet . 
On March 13 2003 , Lord Goldsmith told Lord Falconer , then a Home Office minister , and Baroness Morgan , Mr Blair 's director of political and government relations , that he believed an invasion would , after all , be legal without a new UN security council resolution , according to Mr Sands . 
On March 17 , in response to a question from Baroness Ramsay , a Labor peer , Lord Goldsmith stated that it was `` plain '' Iraq continued to be in material breach of UN resolution 1441 . 
`` Plain to whom ? ' 
It is clear , he says , that Lord Goldsmith 's answer was `` neither a summary nor a precis of any of the earlier advices which the attorney general had provided '' . 
He adds : `` The March 17 statement does not seem to have been accompanied by a formal and complete legal opinion or advice in the usual sense , whether written by the attorney general , or independently by a barrister retained by him '' . 
Separately , the Guardian has learned that Lord Goldsmith told the inquiry into the use of intelligence in the run-up to war that his meeting with Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan was an informal one . 
He did not know whether it was officially minuted . 
Lord Goldsmith also made clear he did not draw up the March 17 written parliamentary answer . 
They `` set out my view '' , he told the Butler inquiry , referring to Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan . 
Yet the following day , March 18 , that answer was described in the Commons order paper as the attorney general 's `` opinion '' . 
During the debate , influential Labor backbenchers and the Conservative frontbench said it was an important factor behind their decision to vote for war . 
Robin Cook , the former foreign secretary and leader of the Commons , yesterday described the Guardian 's disclosure as alarming . 
`` It dramatically reveals the extent to which the legal opinion on the war was the product of a political process . '' 
The case for seeing the attorney general 's original advice was now overwhelming , Mr Cook added . 
`` What was served up to parliament as the view of the attorney general turned out to be the view of two of the closest aides of the prime minister , '' he said . 
Sir Menzies Campbell , the Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , said the government 's position had been seriously undermined . 
`` The substance of the attorney general 's advice , and the process by which it was partially published , simply do not stand up to scrutiny , '' he said . 
Sir Menzies added : `` The issue is all the more serious since the government motion passed by the House of Commons on March 18 2003 , endorsing military action against Iraq , was expressly based on that advice . '' 
He continued : `` The public interest , which the government claims justifies non-publication of the whole of the advice , can only be served now by the fullest disclosure . '' 
Lord Goldsmith twice changed his view in the weeks up to the invasion . 
He wrote to Mr Blair on March 14 2003 , saying it was `` essential '' that `` strong evidence '' existed that Iraq was still producing weapons of mass destruction . 
The next day , the prime minister replied , saying : `` This is to confirm it is indeed the prime minister 's unequivocal view that Iraq is in further material breach of its obligations . '' 
The same day , Lord Boyce got the unequivocal advice he says he was after in a two-line note from the attorney gen eral 's office . 
The extent of concern among military chiefs is reflected by Gen Sir Mike Jackson , head of the army , quoted by Peter Hennessy , professor of contemporary history at Queen Mary College , London . 
`` I spent a good deal of time recently in the Balkans making sure Milosevic was put behind bars , '' said Sir Mike . 
`` I have no intention of ending up in the next cell to him in the Hague . '' 
Mr Sands records that Lord Goldsmith visited Washington in February 2003 when he met John Bellinger , legal adviser to the White House National Security Council . 
An official later told Mr Sands : `` We had trouble with your attorney , we got him there eventually . '' 
A spokeswoman for Lord Goldsmith said yesterday : `` The attorney has said on many occasions he is not going to discuss process issues '' . 
The March 17 parliamentary answer was the `` attorney 's own answer '' , she said adding that he would not discuss the processes of how the document was drawn up . 
The Department for Constitutional Affairs said it could not say if Lord Falconer had a role in drawing up the answer .

2005-02-26,"From Surrey to Basra , abuse is a fact of British army life Officers who blame ' a few bad apples ' ignore a culture of brutalisation Saturday 26 February 2005 02.13 GMT Stanley Kubrick 's film Full Metal Jacket must rank as one of the grimmest portrayals of the Vietnam war . 
A leading character , dubbed `` Joker '' , is asked why he volunteered ; he replies : '' -LRB- I -RRB- wanted to meet interesting , stimulating people from an ancient land ... and kill them . '' 
Confronted with the harrowing photographic evidence of abuse by British soldiers in Iraq , it is tempting to add the phrase `` humiliate , sexually abuse , and torture '' to this admission . 
We seem to have moved a long way from the promise of restoring democracy to the Iraqi people . 
Part of the war has been conducted at a court martial in the ancient German city of Osnabruck , where two soldiers of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers have been found guilty of abusing civilian prisoners . 
A third soldier had already pleaded guilty to assault , after he was photographed standing on an Iraqi prisoner . 
It is not only these men who stood trial , but the British army itself . 
And for many people around the world , the British people also bear some responsibility . 
Even before these convictions , the militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , who has been linked to al-Qaida , claimed that suicide attacks were `` in response to the harm inflicted by British occupation forces on our brothers in prison '' . 
Given our army 's record of abuse and torture in Malaya , Kenya , Aden , Cyprus , and Northern Ireland -LRB- to name just a few -RRB- , is it any wonder that many people might react cynically to claims that justice has been done ? 
The evidence of abuse on British army premises in Iraq that was revealed during the trial indicates that something is seriously wrong with our armed forces . 
Rituals involving physical and psychological humiliation , as well as sexual abuse , are not confined to overseas operations , but are also present `` at home '' . 
A survey carried out by the Ministry of Defense in 2002 found that more than 40 % of British soldiers believed the army had a problem with bullying , sexual discrimination and harassment . 
More recently , an official study claims that almost half the women serving in the RAF have been sexually harassed at some point in their career . 
And only yesterday , the Sun published photographs of members of the Queen 's Guard apparently ritually humiliating a new recruit by tying him naked to a fence and pouring what appears to be manure over his head . 
In addition , the claims of ritual humiliation and sexual abuse at Deepcut training camp , in Surrey , are profoundly disturbing . 
A police report into the barracks contained more than 100 allegations of serious abuse . 
The fact that the army was aware of the repeated violent , predatory behavior of men such as Lance Corporal Leslie Skinner -LRB- convicted in 2004 of a series of sexual attacks on young recruits -RRB- and Lance Corporal David Atkinson -LRB- who murdered Cambridge student Sally Geeson on New Year 's Day -RRB- , is another indictment of the institution . 
The army insists that these are aberrations - a few `` bad apples '' . 
But it is plausible to assume that bullying and abuse are more widespread than senior officers wish to admit . 
Within the barracks , a culture of silence prevails . 
Leslie Skinner 's victims , for instance , said nothing for years . 
The reason for their reticence was that Skinner was `` rank '' and in the army `` you do what you are told '' . 
Unquestioning obedience is inculcated into every recruit . 
Basic training , from the donning of a uniform to being subjected to a relentless series of drills and chants , induces a lessening of self-awareness . 
Such a process of de-individuation can lead to the weakening of restraints against prohibited forms of behavior . 
This is coupled with the fact that positive military values include aggression , dominance and overt displays of physical prowess . 
Sensitivity , understanding and compassion are routinely derided . 
The `` macho '' culture in training barracks is shared by female soldiers too , many of whom become obsessed with the need to trounce the boys . 
And despite their enthusiasm , `` GI Janes '' often become targets of abuse . 
During the Gulf war , much was made of the fact that two US servicewomen taken prisoner had been raped . 
What was less publicised was that 24 US servicewomen reported being raped or sexually assaulted by colleagues during the withdrawal of forces . 
Similarly , 29 % of American women who served in Vietnam were victims of actual or attempted sexual assault . 
Clearly , ethical and moral codes change in the conditions of military life . 
These altered standards , together with isolation from family and civilian networks , favor brutalisation . 
So , too , does the general ambience of preparing for war . 
In the Falklands war of 1982 , for instance , British soldiers on troop ships were shown violent pornographic films as a way of stimulating their aggression prior to battle . 
Young male recruits in particular were terrified of being derided as `` queer '' and `` chicken '' . 
Those who refused to participate in `` raggings '' or group abuse were regarded as lacking loyalty . 
Ostracism was dreaded : it denied recruits what little comfort could be grasped in an often alienating environment . 
As one soldier put it , it was `` dangerous enough just fighting the acknowledged enemy '' . 
In the front line , of course , both abuse and fear of reporting abuse increase exponentially . 
The British army prides itself on its professionalism and its discipline . 
Its adherence to codes of honorable behavior in battle is central to the way the British army markets itself , particularly in opposition to other fighting forces -LRB- such as the Germans during the two world wars , and the Americans in the current conflict -RRB- . 
But this image may be exploded as a result of the war in Iraq . 
In all armies , the horror of battle can reduce inhibitions to atrocious behavior . 
But this seems to be more likely on some battlefields than others . 
During the second world war , for example , British and American servicemen were significantly more likely to act in atrocious ways in the Pacific theater of war compared with the European one . 
The guerrilla nature of warfare in the Pacific partly explained the greater willingness of soldiers to hit out blindly against enemy combatants and civilians alike . 
But racism also played a significant part . 
As drill instructors told recruits : `` You 're not going to Europe , you 're going to the Pacific . 
Do n't hesitate to fight the Japs dirty . '' 
Classifying the Japanese as inhuman meant they all became fair game . 
In Iraq , too , it is hard to avoid the conclusion that racial and religious differences are fuelling much of the abuse being carried out by the occupying forces . 
Refusing to participate in abuses , as well as reporting maltreatment , becomes extremely difficult in such contexts . 
Although servicemen and women are only required to obey lawful orders , immediate and total obedience is deeply ingrained . 
As one sergeant recalled after witnessing an atrocity in Vietnam : `` There was no chance of ever having anything done , and I ... did n't want to get hassled or thrown into the brig ... I just tucked it away in some dead space ... and went on functioning . '' 
The ethos promoted by army life and that accepted within civilian societies will always differ . 
What we have been seeing in Iraq , however , is the complete divorce between the two .

2005-02-27,"There are not many newspaper articles that can genuinely claim to have changed the world for the better . 
But on Sunday , 28 May 1961 , The Observer published a campaigning piece on the front of its Weekend Review section . 
The article was entitled ` The Forgotten Prisoners ' and it was by Peter Benenson , a 40-year old Eton-educated London lawyer . 
Benenson had been angered after learning about two Portuguese students who had been arrested and imprisoned for seven years after drinking a toast to liberty in a Lisbon cafe during the Salazar dictatorship . 
As Benenson later said : ` That so enraged me that I walked up the steps of St Martin-in-the-Fields , out of the Underground , and went in to see what could really be done effectively to mobilise world opinion . ' 
His solution seemed simple : to bombard the Portuguese regime with written protests . 
As Martin Ennals , a future Amnesty secretary-general observed later , it was ` an amazing contention that prisoners of conscience could be released by writing letters to governments ' . 
But rather than have just one campaign for one country , why not draw public attention to the plight of political and religious prisoners throughout the world ? 
This was the basis of his Observer article , which took the shape of a series of letters published as an ` Appeal for Amnesty ' . 
His article began : ` Open your newspaper - any day of the week - and you will find a report from somewhere in the world of someone being imprisoned , tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government . 
The newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence . 
Yet if these feelings of disgust all over the world could be united into common action , something effective could be done . ' 
He could not have predicted how right he has proved to be . 
Benenson had intended his campaign to run for a year , but the response to his article was overwhelming . 
The term ` prisoner of conscience ' , which he coined , soon became common currency and the movement 's logo , a candle surrounded by barbed wire , became a worldwide symbol of hope . 
Amnesty 's campaigns have saved countless prisoners from torture or death . 
From South Africa , Chile and Uganda to Iraq , Burma and China , Amnesty 's work has helped secure the release of political prisoners and highlighted human rights violations . 
Closer to home Amnesty has also been critical of policies of the former prime minister , Margaret Thatcher , and more recently Tony Blair 's anti-terrorist legislation . 
Irene Khan , its present secretary general , said yesterday : ` His vision gave birth to human rights activism . 
Peter Benenson 's life was a courageous testament to his visionary commitment to fight injustice around the world . 
He brought light into the darkness of prisons , the horror of torture chambers and tragedy of death camps around the world . 
` This was a man whose conscience shone in a cruel and terrifying world , who believed in the power of ordinary people to bring about extraordinary change and , by creating Amnesty International , he gave each of us the opportunity to make a difference . ' 
The Leader of the House of Commons , Peter Hain , a long-time campaigner against the former apartheid regime in South Africa , led the political tributes last night . 
` He lit a torch for human rights which Amnesty International has kept burning across the world in being constantly vigilant about abuses , ' Hain said . 
In Amnesty 's first few years Benenson 's energy was vital to its success . 
He provided much of its funding and was involved in all aspects of the organization . 
` At that time we were still putting our toes in the water and learning as we went on , ' he later said . 
` We tried every technique of publicity and we were very grateful for the widespread help of journalists and television crews throughout the world who not only sent us information about the names of prisoners but also , whenever they could , gave space to stories about prisoners . ' 
Amnesty 's membership is now more than a million , with supporters in more than 160 countries and territories . 
It has dealt with the cases of 47,000 prisoners of conscience and other victims of human rights violation . 
More than 45,000 of these are now closed . 
In 1977 Amnesty International was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its tireless fight against injustice . 
Former prisoner of conscience Julio de Pena Valdez , a trade union leader in the Dominican Republic , has spoken of the impact of an Amnesty letter-writing campaign . 
` When the 200 letters came , the guards gave me back my clothes . 
Then the next 200 letters came and the prison director came to see me . 
When the next pile of letters arrived , the director got in touch with his superior . 
The letters kept coming and coming - 3,000 of them . 
The president was informed . 
` The letters still kept arriving and the president called the prison and told them to let me go . ' 
Benenson was born on 31 July 1921 , the grandson of the Russian-Jewish banker Grigori Benenson . 
He later converted to Catholicism . 
He was tutored privately by WH Auden , then went to Eton and Oxford , where he studied history . 
His flair for controversy emerged early , when his complaint to the headmaster of Eton about the poor quality of the school 's food prompted a letter to his mother warning of her son 's ` revolutionary tendencies . 
At age 16 , he launched his first campaign : to get school support , during the Spanish Civil War , for the newly-formed Spanish Relief Committee which was helping Republican war orphans . 
He himself ` adopted ' one of the babies , helping to pay for its support . 
His concern about political imprisonment and mistreatment was inspired by Arthur Koestler 's Spanish Testament , which described the horrors of imprisonment and threatened execution by the Fascists . 
It was this concern that led to his next campaign - the plight of Jews who had fled from Hitler 's Germany . 
Despite some opposition , he succeeded in getting his school friends and their families to raise # 4,000 to bring two young German Jews to Britain . 
After leaving Eton , he helped his politically committed mother find homes in various countries for refugee children who arrived in London . 
The Trades Union Congress sent him to Spain as its observer at the trials of trade unionists in the early Fifties . 
He was appalled by what he saw in the courtrooms and in the prisons . 
In one instance he was so outraged by the proceedings that he drew up a list of complaints with which he confronted the trial judge over dinner . 
The trial ended with acquittals , a rarity in fascist Spain . 
Benenson , who had been ill for some time , died on Friday evening at the John Radcliffe Hospital , Oxford . 
Lighting a candle in St Martin-in-the Fields church to mark the twentieth anniversary of Amnesty , he said : ' I have lit this candle , in the words of Shakespeare , ` against oblivion ' - so that the forgotten prisoners should always be remembered . 
We work in Amnesty against oblivion . '

2005-02-28,"Monday 28 February 2005 00.53 GMT Who would have thought that 13 pages of paper would so come to haunt Tony Blair ? 
Yet the full version of the opinion drawn up by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , about the legality of a military attack on Iraq will , I suspect , come to rank in recent British history only with the protocol enshrining the Anglo-French-Israeli collusion before the invasion of Suez in 1956 . 
Sir Anthony Eden instructed his cabinet secretary to burn the British copy of that protocol . 
Tony Blair has long been irritated by what he sees as a malign British obsession with procedure rather than results . 
In the past he has publicly dismissed such debate about the nuances and due processes of government as a kind of anorakry . 
Here he is in the House of Commons in July 2000 on the significance of the ministerial code , formerly known as questions of procedure for ministers : `` No one will be better governed through finetuning the ministerial code . 
Those are good issues for academics and constitutional experts , but they are not the big issues that parliament should debate when we consider our role in modern society . '' 
The Butler report placed such matters as proper procedure right at the heart of Blair 's prime ministerial `` role in the modern society '' . 
On July 20 2004 , six days after Butler was published , Blair was on his feet in the Commons undertaking to implement its procedural recommendations . 
The constitutional anorak suddenly fitted the prime ministerial shoulders . 
`` Prior to the war , '' he said , `` meetings were held with an informal group , including the foreign and defense secretaries , the chief of the defense staff , the head of the Secret Intelligence Service , the chairman of the JIC , and my foreign policy adviser . 
In any future situation , such a group , which brought together the key players required to work on operational military planning and developing the diplomatic strategy , will operate formally as an ad hoc cabinet committee . '' 
In his report , Lord Butler showed that the government 's fundamental shift in the spring of 2002 from a policy of containing Saddam Hussein to one designed `` to enforce disarmament '' was not based on any new development in the current intelligence picture on Iraq . 
Similarly , in the run-up to the war , Goldsmith -LRB- who eventually judged it legal without a further , specific UN resolution authorising the use of force -RRB- warned his ministerial colleagues that `` there would be no justification for the use of force against Iraq on grounds of self-defence against an imminent threat '' . 
One of the impressive aspects of the Butler report was the way his committee followed the intelligence trail into the attorney general 's office and assessed the degree to which it did or did not shape his advice to the prime minister 's group on Iraq and to the cabinet . 
The attorney general 's legal opinion has not been published in full . 
All parliament has been given is a written answer from Goldsmith , with an accompanying summary prepared by the Foreign Office , dated March 17 2003 . 
The Butler committee has seen the opinion in full . 
What we did not know until Butler appeared before the select committee on October 21 2004 was that initially the government had been unwilling to show it to Butler 's committee of privy counsellors . 
As Butler put it : `` There were moments when we had a bit of tension with the government about whether they were going to disclose documents to us . 
One of the examples of that was the attorney general 's legal opinion . 
Had we gone public and said , ` We think this is relevant to our committee and the government will not give use access to it , ' we would have had huge public and media support . 
That was an important leverage on the government . '' 
Butler 's revelation was striking in itself . 
But it also suggested that Goldsmith 's opinion , which led to the resignation of Elizabeth Wilmshurst , the FO 's foremost expert on the legality of military operations , was even more finely balanced than we had thought . 
Missing from the Butler report is the information that it was not ministers who requested that final legal opinion from Goldsmith . 
It was the senior military and top civil servants in the Ministry of Defense who did so . 
Can the full cabinet really have tested Goldsmith 's opinion when , as Butler reported , the attorney general set out his view on the legal position to the cabinet on March 17 2003 , by producing and speaking to the written answer he gave to parliament on that date ? 
For me , this and the other accumulations of failures to scrutinise and question in the privacy of the cabinet room amounts to a dereliction of cabinet government comparable only to 1956 . 
Then Eden 's cabinet did not press him at the height of the Suez crisis on the significance of his telling them that `` from secret conversations which had been held in Paris with representatives of the Israeli government , it now appeared that the Israelis would not alone launch a full-scale attack against Egypt '' . 
From these remains you did not need a background in British intelligence to sniff out the collusion between the UK , France and Israel , which Eden subsequently flatly denied in the Commons . 
For me , Goldsmith 's March 2003 opinion on the legality of the Iraq war remains the fault-line under the Blair government . 
Like the permanent stain of Suez on Eden 's reputation , it will not be eradicated from the memory of the Blair premierships for generations to come . 
The ultimate systems failure in both instances occurred at proper , formal cabinet meetings . 
If the full cabinet will not take on a dominant prime minister in full cry , there is no other part of the system of government that can compensate for such supineness . 
The Commons , even if it is permitted a specific vote on peace and war -LRB- as it was in 2003 -RRB- , is not going to possess a range and detail of knowledge comparable to that of ministers . 
In the Commons last July , Blair promised to tighten up his procedures if , heaven forbid , he should contemplate leading his country into another war of pre-emption . 
It was a welcome recognition that Butler 's concerns were justified . 
But can it make any difference if cabinet ministers will not , in a phrase beloved of Roy Jenkins , `` rise to the level of events '' ? 
With a few big exceptions in the cabinet room , such as Gordon Brown and John Prescott , power and place come courtesy of Blair alone . 
`` Tony wants '' usually means that `` Tony gets '' . 
Will the Butler report really change those ingrained habits on the part of the dispenser and the receivers of patronage ? 
Only , I suspect , if the engines of war are cranked up once more .

2005-03-04,"' I just want to survive and go home with all my body parts ' Fears of soldiers on patrol in Mosul as US military death toll in Iraq tops 1,500 Friday 4 March 2005 03.27 GMT The city was quiet but the soldiers sitting and swaying inside the Stryker were animated by their favorite debate : was it better to be five metres or 20 metres from an explosion ? 
The front gunner belonged to the 20-metre school , figuring the greater distance reduced your chances of losing limbs to the blast . 
The two rear gunners scoffed and said that would increase the odds of being hit by shrapnel , which fanned upwards and outwards . 
Five months of patrolling Mosul had furnished evidence for both views and the discussion was as well-worn as the Stryker 's tyres . 
Sergeant David Phillips , 23 , sighed and patted his flak jacket . 
`` I just want to stay alive and go home with all my body parts . '' 
He spoke for 150,000 American soldiers in Iraq . 
Yesterday the number of US military deaths since the March 2003 invasion crept over 1,500 . 
There was no official acknowledgment of the milestone , just curt statements that three soldiers had died in two separate attacks on Wednesday . 
`` Names are being withheld pending notification of next of kin . '' 
The figure includes accidents . 
The daily drip of US casualties passes almost unnoticed now , a footnote to the wider slaughter of Iraqis : five policemen killed in two car bombs yesterday , 13 soldiers killed on Wednesday , a judge on Tuesday , at least 115 police and army recruits and civilians on Monday . 
Some 18,000 civilians are estimated to have died . 
Yesterday 's headlines were about the renewal of Iraq 's state of emergency , fresh attacks on oil pipelines , and deadlock between Shias and Kurds over forming a new government . 
The men of Bravo company , an infantry unit which rides in the armored Stryker vehicles of 321 Battalion in Mosul , did not care that since George Bush 's re-election the artificial limbs and flag-draped coffins of US troops have faded in political significance . 
For them , it was personal . 
`` I do n't tell my mom or my wife that we drive up and down streets getting blown up every day . 
They 'd just worry all the time . 
I tell them we sit in the base and do the odd mission , '' said Sgt Nathan Purdy , who is 23 . 
A week embedded with Bravo company , midway through a year-long stint in an insurgent stronghold , showed a group of men with good morale and determination to catch `` bad guys '' but divided over the war and frustrated by an elusive enemy . 
There was consensus about the reaction when home on leave . 
`` People wanting to buy you drinks , buy you food , wanting to shake your hand , they made you feel a hero , '' said Specialist Matt Sutton , 24 , from Illinois . 
Those from liberal states such as Washington said anti-war activists did not criticise them personally or echo the Vietnam-era chant of baby killer . 
`` The country is behind us . 
They did n't dare , '' said one lieutenant . 
Bravo Company 's quarters are a bombed-out palace in the grounds of Camp Freedom , a sprawl of cabins and concrete shelters . 
Mortars land regularly but tend not to hit anything . 
Lieutenant Colonel Mike Gibler said his battalion 's main objective was rebuilding the Iraqi security forces which `` imploded '' last November after insurgents overran Mosul 's police stations . 
The Iraqi army was improving thanks to joint operations and would soon take half of the responsibility of securing the city . 
Asked about the police force he rolled his eyes , but speculated that there was enough progress for US forces to leave within three years . 
His desk had tomes on Islam and a `` Do n't mess with Texas '' sticker . 
Enlisted men were less sure about progress , complaining they were always on the defensive and waiting to be attacked by insurgents . 
`` They fight like bitches , pop a few shots , then hide , '' said Sgt Ramirez Flores . 
Drive-by shootings have wounded several in the unit but the big fear is roadside bombs which according to the Pentagon accounted for 56 % of all US battle deaths in the first two months of this year . 
They are hidden in rubbish bags , animal carcasses , holes , rubble , cars and carts , turning every object into a potential killer . 
A suicide car bomber rammed and immolated one of the battalion 's Strykers but all the occupants survived , prompting reverence for the eight-wheel , 23-tonne monsters . 
A tip about weapons caches this week led to a midnight mission to dig up a lawn . 
`` Fucking gardeners - what are we doing here ? '' 
`` And tomorrow we 're giving out candy to kids again , '' replied his friend . 
`` We did n't train for this . ''

2005-03-05,"The outrages of Abu Ghraib are no accident , says Stephen Sedley The Torture Papers : The Road to Abu Ghraib edited by Karen J Greenberg and Joshua L Dratel -LRB- 900pp , Cambridge , # 27.50 -RRB- Torture and Truth : America , Abu Ghraib and the War on Terror by Mark Danner -LRB- 650pp , Granta , # 16.99 -RRB- How cruelly is a captor allowed to treat a captive before the pain and fear amount to torture ? 
According to advice given by US Assistant Attorney-General Jay S Bybee to President 's Counsel Alberto Gonzales in August 2002 , it `` must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical injury such as organ failure , impairment of bodily function or even death '' . 
With the sanction of such morally and legally ignoble advice , the US has been interrogating , and from time to time killing , an unknown number of captives in Guantnamo , Afghanistan , Iraq and almost certainly elsewhere . 
Meanwhile the author of the advice had been made a judge of the ninth circuit federal appeal court , and the presidential counsel who accepted and adopted it is now the United States attorney general . 
The solitary governmental voice apparently raised against it was that of Colin Powell , who is no longer secretary of state . 
Europe is not entirely divorced from this process . 
When Ireland took the United Kingdom to the European Court of Human Rights over the treatment of suspects in Northern Ireland in 1978 , the Strasbourg court held that such practices as hooding , sensory disorientation and sleep disruption in pursuit of information amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment - which are also banned by the human rights convention - but not to torture . 
Bybee and his colleagues built on this in seeking to limit the meaning of torture , for the purposes of the international Convention Against Torture , to little more than mutilation and murder . 
But they also , and inconsistently , developed a theory that in fighting terrorism the president , as commander-in-chief , is in any case not bound by either national or international law . 
Gonzales , for his part , brought into being the hitherto unknown category of `` unlawful combatant '' , to whom the protections of the Geneva Conventions could be denied because , although a soldier , such a combatant was fighting for a faction -LRB- the Taliban or al-Qaida -RRB- and not a state . 
The word `` unlawful '' in this context has no meaning except to signify that such people will be denied the protection of the law . 
The licence it carries has been silently transferred to Iraq , which on any view is a state . 
Powell 's objections to the destruction of the work of a century of international law were brushed aside by Gonzales . 
The documents which have now revealed all this , and very much more , are collected in each of these solid volumes . 
They cover largely the same ground - an assembly of official memoranda and reports , most of them never intended for publication , prefaced by brief editorial essays . 
Although Mark Danner 's book is short of an index , there is little need for more : comment on most of the documents would look feeble beside the documents themselves . 
The official military reports on the revealed abuses have been published by the US administration . 
The rest -LRB- including , one assumes , the report of the International Red Cross , which ordinarily speaks only to governments -RRB- have been leaked ; though in some cases - notably that of the legal memoranda - partial leakage prompted full disclosure . 
Nothing much seems to have been obtained under the Freedom of Information Act . 
For Iraqis , already accustomed to unspeakable things happening to anyone detained by Saddam 's police in Abu Ghraib , little can have changed . 
But one of America 's leading legal journalists , Anthony Lewis of the New York Times , in an illuminating introduction to The Torture Papers , draws out the grim moral that - in the words of the former national security adviser to George Bush senior , Donald Gregg - it was the legal memoranda that `` cleared the way for the horrors that have been revealed '' in the US-run detention facilities . 
These books contain extensive evidence that Lewis and Gregg are right . 
They include a mass of depositions and reports about what was going on in the detention facilities . 
Reading the detailed and objective findings of investigating officers , one begins to wonder whether the brutality was not in truth the rogue activity of a few privates , corporals and paramilitaries , while the legal sanctioning of torture thousands of miles away in Washington had more to do with the sophisticated techniques taught over many decades by the US Special Forces and CIA to client dictatorships . 
But it becomes inexorably apparent that the crude use of fear and pain on detainees was not simply the localized abuse of absolute power by individuals unfit to hold it . 
Stripping Iraqi men of their clothing and making them wear women 's underwear for days on end , or setting dogs on them when naked , makes a precise fit with the official doctrine that anything short of killing and maiming is a legitimate way of breaking people down for interrogation . 
Evidence has crept out of Afghanistan of the use of similar techniques there . 
Danner , in one of his own New York Review of Books articles which introduce his volume , traces `` water-boarding '' -LRB- repeated near-drowning -RRB- from the French war in Algeria through the dirty war in Argentina to the interrogation since 9\/11 by CIA operatives of `` high value '' suspects in locations which have never been disclosed . 
Does even a democracy have nevertheless to countenance such methods when its back is to the wall ? 
Other democracies have not thought so : many of their governments have refused to pass illiberal laws in response to terrorism , and where some have sought to do so their judiciaries have pointed out that if the reaction to terrorists is to abandon the rule of law , terrorism will have achieved an irreversible victory . 
The supreme court of India in 2003 held that India 's prevention of terrorism laws must respect the fundamental human rights recognized in the constitution . 
The Israeli supreme court , under its remarkable president Aharon Barak , has - not too successfully , it must be said - told the government and army in a series of judgments that while democracy is fated to fight with one hand tied behind its back , `` none the less , it has the upper hand . 
Preserving the rule of law and recognition of individual liberties ... strengthen its spirit , and this strength allows it to overcome its difficulties '' . 
In this country the law lords , rejecting the legacy of wartime decisions permitting arbitrary executive detention , have found detention without trial a greater evil than the evil it is intended to challenge . 
Perhaps the strongest evidence that the abuse of prisoners in US hands has been systemic , not aberrant , is the simplest : it is the fact that those involved felt it was quite safe to be photographed repeatedly while committing it . 
Personnel who fear disciplinary reprisal , or even disapproval , do not usually make a visual record of their conduct . 
If it says something for Donald Rumsfeld , the defense secretary , that he twice tendered his resignation over the Abu Ghraib disclosures , it says rather more about the Bush administration that his offer was on both occasions rejected . 
The outcome of the events tracked in these two books , for which both men bear responsibility , is a world order of which the icon has become a hooded figure , its arms outstretched in torment . 
The apologists who blame a few bad apples in the barrel might do well to remember what a few bad apples do : they make the whole barrel rotten .

2005-03-06,"We should not ask whether the Iraq invasion was ` legal ' - we should ask whether it was ` good ' Sunday 6 March 2005 01.36 GMT Last week 's jilbab decision left me wondering whether the law was always this important . 
Was n't there a time when schools could take decisions about the uniforms their pupils should wear without a judge having the final say ? 
I see the advantages of greater legal protection for the individual and I also see the problems . 
And one of the dangers is that we may become reliant on legal processes to settle for us the question of what is right and what is wrong when , in reality , morality can neither begin nor end with the law . 
Just as we talk more than we used to about law at home , so we also increasingly discuss international law . 
Thus it was with some fanfare that , also last week , Penguin published an important book by Professor Philippe Sands , a brilliant international lawyer . 
In Lawless World , Sands 's central proposition is that the war on terror and the war on Iraq , as prosecuted by America and supported by Britain , pose a unique threat to a valuable system of international justice . 
There is much that I can agree with in the book . 
In particular , I accept that the arbitrary procedures for dealing with ` terror ' suspects at Guantanamo and Bagram have been a disaster , enhancing the likelihood of abuse , violating basic principles , discrediting those who laid most claim to be upholding human rights and strengthening opposition . 
And yet I have some problems with other aspects of his approach . 
One is that , at important moments in his arguments about the law , I find that I have ceased to care as much as he wants me to about whether this or that action is , strictly speaking , legal . 
Instead , I find myself more concerned about whether the action is right . 
I 'm not alone ; many of those who routinely use the word ` illegal ' about the war do n't do so because of a detailed appreciation of Sands 's judgment on UN Resolution 1,441 versus that of , say , Professor Greenwood of the LSE , but merely as meaning ` very bad ' . 
And a second is that I find myself wondering at the selectivity , the implied politicisation , if you like , of what are claimed to be dispassionate legal observations . 
It is interesting , for example , that though the book 's index lists 15 references to Abu Ghraib prison and the abuses carried out there , only one mentions it was a prison under Saddam , and none details the years when executions and torture made Abu Ghraib infamous throughout the Arab world . 
Let me further illustrate this problem of partiality . 
Before the war , a group of international lawyers , including Sands , wrote to newspapers , pointing out that an invasion of Iraq without a specific resolution of the UN Security Council would undermine the rule of law . 
The final paragraph added : ` Of course , even with that authorisation , serious questions would remain . 
A lawful war is not necessarily a just , prudent or humanitarian war . ' 
This caveat would , presumably , have left some of the authors free to campaign against military action , even if it had been mandated by the Security Council . 
But it inevitably implied that an illegal war , or a non-legal war , might quite possibly be a just , prudent or humanitarian one . 
Sands goes some way to suggest that a humanitarian justification of the war might have been available in the 1980s -LRB- or , one supposes , in 1991\/2 -RRB- when Saddam was at his most murderous . 
This is a position shared , I think , by Human Rights Watch . 
And , in giving evidence last year to the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee , Sands even seemed to recognize that under such circumstances , no authorisation by the Security Council , explicit or implicit , might be necessary . 
` My personal view , ' he told the MPs , ` is very much moving towards the view that the circumstances of Kosovo -LRB- where no UN authorisation was sought or obtained -RRB- do not pose a problem in existing rules of international law . ' 
Of course , this was a slightly unhelpful five years after the event . 
Just how the sands can shift was further illustrated by his response to the committee chairman 's worry that he was in danger of sanctifying the decisions of a body - the Security Council - which is notoriously susceptible to political and even capricious vetoes . 
` Would not , ' he was asked , ` the international law be an ass if it could not respond in those circumstances ? ' 
Sands replied that humanitarian intervention was a ` gray area , but many people are now beginning to accept that is justifiable . 
In those circumstances , it does not matter what the Security Council does . 
If there is an overriding threat to fundamental human rights on a massive scale then , irrespective of what the Security Council does , one state or a group of states may claim to be free to act . ' 
But in the book , Sands describes Tony Blair 's suggestion that Britain was entitled to override an ` unreasonable ' veto as ` outrageous ' . 
We have set up the rules of the Security Council and we must abide by them , he writes elsewhere . 
Except , apparently , when we must n't . 
This is the problem . 
In 1972 , a neo-genocide by Pakistan in what is now Bangladesh was stopped by the unilateral intervention of India . 
Pol Pot was ousted by the Vietnamese in 1979 , though the UN continued to recognize the Khmer Rouge leadership . 
Idi Amin 's rule in Uganda was brought to an end by Tanzanian intervention . 
None of these appalling situations was resolved by the UN or the international legal system . 
Nor were what Sands admits were the ` gross failures to intervene to prevent genocide and other atrocities ' in Yugoslavia and Rwanda in the 1990s the product of disregarding international law . 
Sands is against what he sees as American and British illegality because ` relying on bad legal arguments destroys the credibility of governments ' , but he does n't recognize that negligence in the face of mass murder , tyranny , the sponsorship of terror or massive abuses of human rights is a much worse destroyer of credibility . 
He observes that such events as Rwanda and the Balkans ` and most bitterly in the spring of 2003 , Iraq , raised serious questions about the adequacy of international rules to protect fundamental human rights ' . 
But why does the overthrow of a vile regime raise questions ` more bitterly ' than the world 's toleration of the murder of more than 800,000 people ? 
Nor can these negligences be somehow rectified by international courts after the event . 
As Peter Maguire has written : ` The UN has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try nine men in Tanzania , and close to 100,000 remain in prison in Rwanda . 
Has their punishment resurrected the 800,000 hacked to death in 1994 or ended a civil war that now engulfs Congo ? ' 
It is n't just about massacres , either . 
Sands believes that ` the UN 's system of collective security had contained Saddam better than most would have expected ' . 
The unstated price , of course , included sanctions that many reckoned killed far more Iraqis than any war might have done , and the reality that Saddam was allowed to remain in power . 
But he recognizes outcomes can alter the balance of even a legal argument . 
He wrote recently in the Guardian : ` There is little evidence that the world is a safer place , and a great deal more evidence that the Iraq war has provided a major distraction to the challenge posed by global terrorism and al-Qaeda . 
Neither can it be said that the Middle East is more stable or peaceful . ' 
In the book , he describes the invasion as ' a dangerous fiasco ' . 
Meanwhile , the silly , nasty , hubristic old neocons were in disgrace having predicted the spread of democracy . 
This analysis looked a safer bet six months ago than it does now . 
Libya had already got rid of WMD capacity that it admitted possessing , but since then there have been the elections in Iraq , demonstrations against Syrian occupation in Lebanon , elections in Palestine , and suggestions of liberalisation in Saudi Arabia and Egypt . 
Even sceptics are wondering whether something is n't afoot , something caused , in part , by the removal of Saddam . 
In these circumstances , it is an act of epic solipsism to argue this outcome is negated by the affront the action posed to the international legal system , a system that seemed to permit ill-doing and penalize its prevention . 
And if the law prevents good actions and objectively protects bad ones , it needs to be changed . 
Any non-lawyer could tell you that .

2005-03-06,"Bush promises Italian leader a full investigation Sunday 6 March 2005 01.36 GMT The Italian journalist kidnapped in Iraq arrived back in Rome yesterday as fury and confusion grew over the circumstances in which she was shot and one of her rescuers was killed by American soldiers . 
The shooting in Iraq on Friday evening , which occurred as Giuliana Sgrena was being driven to freedom after being released by her captors , was fuelling anti-war activists in Italy and putting pressure on Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi . 
` The hardest moment was when I saw the person who had saved me die in my arms , ' she said . 
Her poignant words and weak , haggard appearance as she had to be helped from the jet that brought her back from Baghdad are fuelling national rage . 
Berlusconi , a staunch ally of the US who defied widespread public opposition to the Iraq war and sent 3,000 troops , took the rare step of summoning US ambassador Mel Sembler to his office . 
He demanded that the US ` leave no stone unturned ' in investigating the incident . 
President George Bush called Berlusconi to promise a full investigation . 
Sgrena , 56 , a journalist for the Communist newspaper Il Manifesto , was hit in the shoulder when US soldiers opened fire on the car she was traveling in as it approached a checkpoint less than a mile from Baghdad airport . 
The Italian secret service officer who had negotiated her release was killed as he shielded her from the gunfire . 
Two of his colleagues were also hurt . 
Berlusconi prides himself on his close personal friendship with President George Bush , but he was grim-faced when he told reporters that someone would have to take responsibility ` for such a grave incident ' . 
The US Army claimed the Italians ' vehicle had been seen as a threat because it was traveling at speed and failed to stop at the checkpoint despite warning shots being fired by the soldiers . 
A State Department official in Washington said the Italians had failed to inform the military of Sgrena 's release . 
Italian reconstruction of the incident is significantly different . 
Sgrena told colleagues the vehicle was not traveling fast and had already passed several checkpoints on its way to the airport . 
The Americans shone a flashlight at the car and then fired between 300 and 400 bullets at if from an armored vehicle . 
Rather than calling immediately for assistance for the wounded Italians , the soldiers ' first move was to confiscate their weapons and mobile phones and they were prevented from resuming contact with Rome for more than an hour . 
Enzo Bianco , the opposition head of the parliamentary committee that oversees Italy 's secret services , described the American account as unbelievable . 
` They talk of a car traveling at high speed , and that is not possible because there was heavy rain in Baghdad and you ca n't travel at speed on that road , ' Bianco said . 
` They speak of an order to stop , but we 're not sure that happened . ' 
Pier Scolari , Sgrena 's partner who flew to Baghdad to collect her , put an even more sinister construction on the events , suggesting in a television interview that Sgrena was the victim of a deliberate ambush . 
` Giuliana may have received information which led to the soldiers not wanting her to leave Iraq alive , ' he claimed . 
Sgrena was kidnapped on 4 February as she interviewed refugees from Falluja near a Baghdad mosque . 
Two weeks later her captors issued a video of her weeping and pleading for help , calling on all foreigners to leave Iraq . 
Italian journalists were subsequently withdrawn from the city after intelligence warnings of a heightened threat to their safety . 
Italian newspapers reported yesterday that Sgrena had been in the hands of former Saddam loyalists and criminals , and that a ransom of between # 4 million and # 5 million had been paid for her release . 
The military intelligence officer who lost his life , Nicola Calipari , 51 , was hailed as a national hero .

2005-03-10,"US to hand over Abu Ghraib jail to Iraqis Thursday 10 March 2005 13.55 GMT American forces have agreed to hand over control of the infamous Abu Ghraib prison to the newly elected Iraqi authorities in an attempt to draw a line under one of the most shameful episodes of the Iraq war . 
Iraq 's human rights minister , Bakhtiar Amin , yesterday told the Guardian that the US had agreed to the pullout at the four main detention facilities , including Abu Ghraib , west of Baghdad , the prison at the center of the abuse and torture scandal . 
Two other locations in the center of Iraq and a British-run prison in the south will also be handed over to Iraqi control , although no deadline has been set , Mr Amin said . 
He said he had requested the transfer of authority of the country 's prisons from Major General William Brandenburg , the US commander of detention facilities in Iraq . 
`` We have discussed and asked that the detention centres be transferred to the Iraqis . 
They agreed to that , '' the human rights minister said . 
`` It is an important sign of Iraq 's new sovereignty that the new authorities take charge of its detainees and its detention facilities . '' 
The prison was at the center of a political storm after revelations of mistreatment and torture of Iraqi inmates by their US guards . 
The scandal was exposed last April with the publication of photographs and video film showing US soldiers abusing naked Iraqis and forcing them to perform sex acts . 
The furore damaged the rep utation of the US army and paved the way for the disclosure of other abuses of Iraqi detainees by foreign troops in Iraq , including by British soldiers in the largely Shia south . 
Mr Amin , whose ministry monitors conditions in Iraq 's US-run penal facilities , said the transfer will begin after the formation of the new Iraqi government , which is due to happen in the next few weeks . 
The transfer would take place gradually and sensibly : `` Iraq still needs time and international assistance and training to prepare and control and run and manage these prisons in a fit and proper way . '' 
US military officials in Baghdad could not be reached for comment yesterday . 
But on Tuesday an army official said US forces were considering pulling out of Abu Ghraib be cause of a spate of attacks on the facility by insurgents . 
Last April , a barrage of 28 mortar rounds killed 22 prisoners and injured 91 . 
The army official said the US would probably transfer only high security detainees in Abu Ghraib to another facility at the US base at Baghdad 's airport , while the majority of the `` common criminals '' would remain under Iraqi control . 
The US-run prison system in Iraq is currently bloated with detainees . 
More than 10,000 are estimated to be behind bars - the highest number since the insurgency began in 2003 . 
Their ranks have swollen during the crackdowns by US and Iraqi security forces before and after the January 30 elections . 
However the rounding up of large numbers of suspects appears to be having little effect on the operational effectiveness of the insurgents . 
In further grim news yesterday , Iraqi officials said that 35 bodies , some shot execution-style , others beheaded , had been discovered at two sites , one just south of the capital and the other near the western border with Syria . 
There are three main US detention centres in Iraq : Abu Ghraib , on the western outskirts of the capital , which holds about 3,160 detainees ; Camp Bucca near the southern city of Umm Qasr , which has at least 5,640 ; and Camp Cropper at the Baghdad international airport complex , where Saddam Hussein and the leaders of the former Ba'athist regime are being held pending trial . 
A fourth detention center is run by British forces at Shaibah near the southern city of Basra , where 818 people are being held . 
Mr Amin said he understood this would also be included in the handover . 
`` After the era of the Saddam regime , where an Iraqi prison was a byword for torture and murder , and the shock of the prisoner abuse by US military guards , a smooth handover would go a long way to restoring the credibility of the country 's justice and penal system . '' 
Mr Amin said conditions at the detention centres had improved enormously since the Abu Ghraib scandal broke , and admitted there were no guarantees that Iraq 's burgeoning prison population would fare any better under Iraqi jurisdiction . 
A state department report last week said that human rights abuses were occurring under the interim Iraqi government , including torture , illegal detention by police and forced confessions , though it accepted that `` a long legacy of serious human rights abuses '' under Saddam had been reversed . 
`` We can not expect the system to become like Denmark 's or Sweden 's overnight , '' Mr Amin conceded . 
`` Saddam created many mini-Saddams . '' 
He said it was crucial that guarantees of human rights in the justice system be included in the permanent constitution that will be drafted by the new parliament .

2005-03-11,"Friday 11 March 2005 01.52 GMT Experts in public health from six countries , including the UK , today castigate the British and American governments for failing to investigate the deaths of civilians caught up in the conflict in Iraq . 
Twenty-four experts from the UK , the US , Australia , Canada , Spain and Italy say the attitude of the governments is `` wholly irresponsible '' . 
They say the UK government 's reliance on `` extremely limited data '' from the Iraqi ministry of health is `` unacceptable '' because it is likely to seriously underestimate the casualties . 
Their hard-hitting statement , published online by the British Medical Journal , comes nearly five months after the Lancet published a household survey of civilian deaths in Iraq which estimated that about 100,000 civilians had died - most of them women and children . 
The study caused controversy and was dismissed by the British government as unreliable , partly because the authors admitted that , under the difficult circumstances , it could not be precise . 
The experts lambast the government for criticising the data without conducting inquiries of its own . 
`` The obvious answer to removing uncertainties that remain is to commission a larger study with full official support and assistance , but scientific independence , '' they say . 
`` Counting casualties can help to save lives both now and in the future by helping us to understand the burden of death , and residual burden of injury , disease and trauma across the entire population , '' the experts say . 
`` We have waited too long for this information . '' 
The Iraqi ministry of health data is not complete . 
Among the reasons for this are that only violence-related deaths reported through the health system are counted and deaths in the first 12 months of the conflict are not included . 
Among the 10 experts from the UK who have signed the statement are Klim McPherson , visiting professor of public health epidemiology at Oxford University , David Hunter , chair of the UK Public Health Association , and Sian Griffiths , immediate past-president of the faculty of public health at the Royal College of Physicians . 
There are seven eminent physicians from the US , three from Australia , two from Spain and one each from Canada and Italy . 
`` Monitoring casualties is a humanitarian imperative , '' they say . 
`` Understanding the causes of death is a core public health responsibility , nationally and internationally . 
Yet neither the public , nor we as public health professionals , are able to obtain validated , reliable information about the extent of mortality and morbidity since the invasion of Iraq . '' 
In a commentary in the BMJ , Professor McPherson says that public access to reliable figures is important . 
`` The policy being assessed - the allied invasion of Iraq - was justified largely on grounds of democratic supremacy . 
Voters in the countries that initiated the war and others - not least in Iraq itself - are denied a reliable evaluation of a key indicator of the success of that policy . 
This is unacceptable . '' 
Understanding the burden of death , disease , injury and trauma aids the proper planning of war and health and will help governments assess the humanitarian implications of conflict , he says . 
`` The plain fact is that an estimate of 100,000 excess deaths attributable to the invasion of Iraq is alarming . 
That is already half the death toll of Hiroshima . 
Apart from the practical arguments , the principled ones stand and will always stand . 
Have we not learned any lessons from the history of sweeping alarming numbers of deaths under the carpet ? 
This is not something about which there can be any political discretion 60 years after Auschwitz . '' 
The Foreign Office said yesterday it believed the figures from the Iraqi ministry of health were the most reliable because they were based on head counts not extrapolation .

2005-03-16,"PM forced into pledge after outrage at killing of Italian officer Italy 's prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi , yesterday announced that he would begin withdrawing his country 's troops from Iraq in September under pressure from public opinion . 
`` I 've spoken to -LRB- Tony -RRB- Blair about this , '' he told a TV interviewer . 
`` We 've got to construct a precise exit strategy . 
Public opinion expects it , and we shall be talking about it soon . '' 
British defense sources last night repeated the British government 's stated policy that its troops will stay in Iraq `` as long as is necessary and as long as the Iraqis want us '' . 
Mr Berlusconi 's comments about a precise exit strategy were `` an aspiration '' or `` political guesswork '' , they added . 
Mr Berlusconi , who is among President Bush 's closest allies , has been under huge domestic pressure over Italy 's staunch support for US policy in Iraq . 
Early next month , he faces a test of electoral strength and in recent weeks he has felt the full force of Italians ' misgivings . 
On March 4 , a senior intelligence officer , Nicola Calipari , was killed by US troops in Baghdad after rescuing an Italian hostage . 
His death united right and left in appalled condemnation , with thousands of Italians turning out to pay their respects to the dead agent during a lying in state . 
Mr Berlusconi dropped his bombshell last night hours af ter Italy 's lower house of parliament , in which the prime minister 's supporters have an outright majority , approved funding for its contingent in Iraq until the end of June . 
Italian officials had already indicated troops would be withdrawn as soon as it was clear that Iraq could handle its own security . 
But Mr Berlusconi went much further than before in defining the outlines of a timetable . 
He said : `` A progressive reduction of the presence of our soldiers will start from September . '' 
He added that the phase-out would take place `` in agreement with our allies '' . 
He was careful not to let himself be pinned down to a finishing date , saying that would `` depend on the ability of the Iraqi government in equipping itself with adequate security and public order forces '' . 
With 3,000 troops , Italy is one of the biggest contributors to the US-led coalition . 
Its forces did not take part in the invasion of Iraq , but were sent in afterwards as part of what Mr Berlusconi and his ministers have always insisted was a peace mission . 
Yesterday saw Italy 's death toll reach 21 when it was announced that a soldier had accidentally shot and killed himself during target practice . 
In London , the government announced yesterday it was proposing an international conference on Iraq later this year to encourage the United Nations and other major organizations to kickstart the stalled reconstruction program . 
A similar idea for a postwar conference was put forward by France a year ago but was blocked by the US , because it was proposed by a country that had spearheaded international opposition to the war . 
But the British idea is gaining widespread support , including that of the US and France . 
The conference would bring together the countries contributing troops , those offering economic help , and the UN , the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund and other international bodies . 
British officials said that the Iraq conference is likely to be held abroad , probably in Brussels . 
The proposal comes as the Iraqi assembly , elected on Jan uary 30 , meets today for the first time . 
But the Shias and Kurds who make up the bulk of the 275-member parliament have so far failed to reach agreement on the formation of a coalition government . 
The assembly will meet behind the concrete blast-barriers and barbed wire that separates Baghdad 's Green Zone , home to the US and British embassies and the interim Iraqi government , from the rest of the Iraqi capital .

2005-03-16,"Wednesday 16 March 2005 03.26 GMT The Pentagon stood accused of sitting on a damaging report from its own auditors on a $ 108.4 m -LRB- # 56.6 m -RRB- overcharge by Halliburton for its services in Iraq yesterday . 
In a scathing letter to George Bush , Democratic congressmen Henry Waxman of California and John Dingell of Michigan said the Defense Contract Audit Agency 's audit was completes last October - before the election . 
They also note that 12 separate requests to the Pentagon to view the completed audits on the contractor 's $ 2.5 bn contract to supply fuel and other services in post-war Iraq had been ignored . 
`` We would like to know why this audit report - and audit reports on nine additional task orders - are being withheld from Congress , '' they wrote . 
`` We also want to know what steps you are taking to recover these funds from Halliburton . '' 
In a second public letter yesterday , Mr Waxman accused Bush administration officials of deliberately withholding information on overcharges by Halliburton from UN auditors - at its behest . 
Some $ 1.6 bn of the $ 2.5 bn Halliburton contract was funded from Iraqi oil revenues overseen by the UN . 
`` The evidence suggests that the US used Iraqi oil proceeds to overpay Halliburton and then sought to hide the evidence of these overcharges from the international auditors , '' the letter says . 
The audit , released by the congressmen on Monday , offers the most definitive glimpse so far of overbilling by Halliburton , once run by the vice president , Dick Cheney . 
In the most startling transaction , it charged the Pentagon $ 27.5 m to ship $ 82,100 worth of cooking and heating fuel to Iraq from Kuwait - 335 times the actual cost of the liquified petroleum gas , a charge the Pentagon auditors said was `` illogical '' . 
The firm and its subsidiary , Kellogg , Brown and Root -LRB- KBR -RRB- , face several investigations , including a fraud inquiry from the justice department . 
A preliminary Pentagon audit , focused on the immediate aftermath of the US-led invasion , found KBR overcharged the Pentagon by $ 61m for kerosene and other fuels . 
Critics of Halliburton are convinced this represents just a fraction of the overcharges . 
The audit released this week covers only one of 10 task orders undertaken under the $ 2.5 bn no-bid contract awarded immediately after the invasion of Iraq . 
However , the overcharges identified in the single task order already dwarf the $ 61m -LRB- # 32m -RRB- in previously discovered overcharges . 
Halliburton charged army corps of engineers $ 875m -LRB- # 457m -RRB- to supply fuel from May 2003 to March 2004 . 
Auditors questioned $ 108.4 m -LRB- # 56.6 m -RRB- of those costs . 
As the Congressmen note , the auditors criticised charges in nearly every area , saying the firm misled auditors and failed to supervise sub-contracts . 
`` Halliburton failed to demonstrate its prices for Kuwaiti fuel were ` fair and reasonable ' , '' the auditors say . 
They also note Halliburton refused repeatedly to provide information on costs of obtaining fuel from Turkey and Jordan , or reveal how it selected its contractors in Kuwait . 
A Halliburton spokeswoman , Wendy Hall , said it was forced into paying , and charging , high costs because of the security situation following the war . 
`` Transporting fuel into Iraq was a mission fraught with danger , which increased the prices that firms were willing to offer for trans portation , '' she told reporters . 
`` The report fails to take into account the fact KBR performed an urgent mission at the army 's request and the mission took place in a wartime environment . '' 
The lawyer for an army corps of engineers whistle-blower said that his client was set to be interviewed for a second time by Pentagon investigators on April 4 over her claims of contracting abuse involving KBR .

2005-03-18,"Soldier wins first VC since Falklands Friday 18 March 2005 12.47 GMT Private Johnson Beharry , 25 , awarded the Victoria Cross for bravery under fire in Iraq . 
Photograph : Toby Melville\/PA A young soldier has been awarded the Victoria Cross , the highest military honor , for bravery under fire in some of the fiercest , and largely unreported , engagements between British forces and insurgents in south-eastern Iraq . 
Private Johnson Beharry , 25 , is the first soldier to receive the VC since the Falklands war in 1982 and the first living recipient since 1969 , when two Australians were given the award for action in Vietnam . 
The citation , gazetted today , describes his `` great heroism '' in two separate encounters in the town of Amara , north of Basra , last summer . 
In the first , on May 1 , the Warrior armored vehicle he was driving was hit by multiple rocket-propelled grenades -LRB- RPGs -RRB- . 
His company , the citation says , had been ordered to extract a foot patrol pinned down by small arms and heavy machine-gun fire and an attack by an improvised explosive device and RPGs . 
As they passed a roundabout on their way to the pinned-down patrol , his platoon noticed that the road ahead was empty of civilians and traffic , an indicator of a potential ambush . 
The platoon commander ordered the vehicle to halt so that he could assess the situation . 
The vehicle was then hit by RPGs . 
The citation continues : `` As a result of this ferocious initial volley of fire , both the platoon commander and the vehicle 's gunner were incapacitated by concussion and other wounds , and a number of the soldiers in the rear of the vehicle were also wounded . '' 
Pte Beharry had no means of communication with the turret crew or any of the other Warriors around him . 
He did not know if his commander or crew were still alive or how serious their injuries were . 
`` On his own initiative , he closed his driver 's hatch and moved forward through the ambush position to try to establish some form of communications , halting just short of a barricade across the road . '' 
The Warrior was hit again by RPGs . 
It caught fire and filled with thick , noxious smoke . 
Pte Beharry , continues the citation , `` assessed that his best course of action to save the lives of his crew was to push through , out of the ambush . 
He drove his Warrior directly through the barricade , not knowing if there were mines or improvised explosive devices placed there to destroy his vehicle . 
By doing this he was able to lead the remaining five Warriors behind him towards safety . '' 
Another RPG hit the Warrior . 
`` The flames and force of the blast passed directly over him , down the driver 's tunnel , further wounding the semi-conscious gunner in the turret . '' 
Pte Beharry was `` forced to drive the vehicle along the rest of the ambushed route , some 1,500 metres , with his hatch opened up and his head exposed to enemy fire , all the time with no communications with any other vehicle . '' 
A 7.62 mm bullet penetrated his helmet and remained lodged on its inner surface . 
Pte Beharry then climbed on to the turret of the burning vehicle and , `` seemingly oblivious to the incoming enemy small arms fire , manhandled his wounded platoon commander out of the turret , off the vehicle and to the safety of a nearby Warrior '' . 
Remounting his burning vehicle for the third time , he drove it through `` a complex chicane and into the security of the defended perimeter of the outpost , thus denying it to the enemy '' . 
Once inside , he collapsed from physical and mental exhaustion . 
A few weeks later , on June 11 , another Warrior convoy he was leading was ambushed . 
A grenade detonated six inches from his head . 
`` With the blood from his head injury obscuring his vision , Beharry managed to continue to control his vehicle and forcefully reversed the Warrior out of the ambush , '' says the citation . 
He then collapsed , unconscious . 
The Grenada-born private was paraded by the top brass yesterday among his comrades in the 1st Battalion , the Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment , and other recipients of high military honors . 
`` I was just doing my job . 
I was just thinking of the guys in the vehicle and the guys behind me , '' he said . 
He was asked what was going through his mind at the time . 
`` An RPG '' , Pte Beharry promptly replied . 
He was not afraid at the time , only afterwards . 
Asked why he had left Grenada , he said he wanted `` a change of life '' . 
Asked if he would be Britain 's first black general , he quickly replied : `` No. '' His wife Lynthia said that after he had been injured he was told he had only a 50-50 chance of surviving . 
She said her husband would return to Iraq `` if he has to '' . 
Pte Beharry 's award was described by Gary Sheffield , a leading historian of the modern British army , as `` a classic in the VC mould - he was rescuing colleagues '' . 
He added : `` It is also testimony of what a nasty war is going on in Iraq . '' 
Lieutenant Colonel Matt Maer , Pte Beharry 's commanding officer , described yesterday how his troops were in action every day for five months , more than 800 times in all . 
It was the longest period of continuous combat experienced by the British army since the Korean war 50 years ago . 
The soldiers were repeatedly attacked by Mahdi militia , supporters of the radical Shia cleric , Moqtada al-Sadr . 
He said 40 of his soldiers were wounded and three killed from his battlegroup of about 1,300 . 
British military sources who experienced the action say they do not know how many Iraqis were killed , but add that hundreds would be an exaggeration . 
"
2005-03-19,"How new is `` New Labor '' ? 
In the heady years after 1997 , the ideologues worked hard to promote an image of youth . 
Labor 's troublesome past , they proclaimed , had been thrown overboard along with its commitment to a socialist economy set down in Clause Four of the 1918 constitution . 
In place of a history , there was a future . 
The party could now adopt or reject slogans and symbols according to the demands of its current branding strategy . 
Hence the appearance of an increasingly bizarre set of stage props starting with `` Cool Britannia '' and climaxing in 2001 with the improbable pink makeover of the British bull-dog . 
But that was all before 9\/11 , before the coupling with Bush and the Iraq war . 
Now New Labor talks little about its former flirtations with the young . 
Better to present itself as the authentic continuation of a social-democratic past . 
This is the point of Patrick Diamond 's New Labor 's Old Roots -LRB- Imprint Academic , # 14.95 -RRB- , a collection of `` revisionist '' Labor texts running from RH Tawney in 1931 to Gordon Brown in 1997 . 
Diamond is a Downing Street adviser and his claim is strongly endorsed by Tony Blair who now depicts New Labor as `` a party which has returned to its roots '' . 
But talk of `` roots '' and continuities can also be misleading . 
It suggests a soft-focus constancy of identity and beliefs that a sharper look at Labor 's history belies . 
What chiefly emerges from the brief biographies and memoirs also noticed here - of Aneurin Bevan , Roy Jenkins and Tony Benn - is the sheer diversity encompassed by Labor and its Whig , liberal and puritan forebears . 
Particularly striking is Tony Benn 's moving childhood memoir , Dare to Be a Daniel -LRB- Hutchinson , # 17.95 -RRB- . 
Benn was brought up in an affluent home , the product of a family publishing empire and two generations of engagement in London progressive politics . 
His father was a Liberal MP who turned to Labor in the 1920s and served in Labor cabinets in 1931 and 1945 . 
The young Benn grew up with a nurse , cook `` and servants to keep house '' ; he came from a family of Lib-Lab political insiders living next door to Sidney and Beatrice Webb on the site of the present Millbank Tower . 
The Benns were authentic Puritans . 
Ever since the writings of George Eliot and Matthew Arnold , Puritanism has been associated with the provinces , with the energy , ambition yet narrowness of the outsider . 
But the metropolitan puritanism of the Benns was no less intense . 
The Benn family were - as Benn still is - teetotal . 
They were not intellectuals . 
His parents showed no interest in whether the young Tony read or what he read : `` All my life I have lived in the oral tradition , learning from listening and watching rather than reading . '' 
This helps to explain why Benn retains such an unruffled belief in a Manichean world in which the forces of good are in perpetual combat with the backsliding and corruption of false friends . 
From the Old Testament stories of his mother , Benn learned to honor prophets , not kings . 
In this picture of politics as a modern day Pilgrim 's Progress , Marx -LRB- despite his atheism -RRB- is honored as `` the last of the Old Testament prophets '' . 
Benn 's parents showed no interest in culture . 
They lived next door to the Tate Gallery , yet never went inside . 
Parsimony was one reason . 
When his father once passed the Tate , what clinched his decision not to enter was `` that it would cost him sixpence '' . 
But what mattered most was not to waste time . 
From the 17th century onwards , Puritans were prone to keep diaries in order to justify to God their use of time . 
Benn 's father kept a daily time chart to set down the number of hours he had worked . 
Benn 's own diary-keeping and the assembling of his political life into a huge domestic archive was clearly inspired by his father . 
If Benn recalls the Puritan inheritance of Labor , Bevan represented the secular revolt against it . 
Although his father was an active Baptist as well as treasurer of the local miners ' lodge , neither religion nor the Puritan ethic left much mark upon Bevan . 
Indeed , in later years he combined his socialism with a taste for high living . 
Bevan 's education was not a product of home , school or chapel , but of the Central Labor College where he learned Marxian economics and the history of Labor 's struggle . 
Like Benn in the 70s , Bevan in the 50s found himself the leader of a leftwing rebellion within the Labor party . 
But as Clare and Francis Beckett point out in their lucid short biography , Bevan -LRB- Haus , # 9.99 -RRB- , he was uninterested in the `` self-righteous sectarianism '' in which the Bennites would later wrap themselves . 
For Bevan the question was `` where was power and which was the road to it '' , a power which he wished to exercise on behalf of `` the working class '' . 
This attitude resulted not only in the foundation of the National Health Service in 1948 , but in his provision of the best of 20th-century public housing through an insistence on high quality standards in the Housing Act of 1946 . 
In Labor mythology Jenkins was often considered the polar opposite of Bevan . 
He was the suave Gaitskellite who split the party and so made possible the triumph of Margaret Thatcher . 
But the young Jenkins himself was once a Bevanite , only switching to Gaitskell once convinced , like Tony Crosland , that socialism should be identified with equality , rather than public ownership . 
Like Bevan unaffected by religion , Jenkins also presided over the dismantling of the puritan moral code which had governed Britain since the triumph of Evangelicalism in Victorian times . 
But unlike Bevan , Jenkins was from the beginning a Labor insider -LRB- his father became Attlee 's political secretary -RRB- and received a good formal education culminating in his time at Balliol College , Oxford , where he mixed easily with the children of the privileged classes . 
In this respect he was an early embodiment of the decline of deference and loosening of social mores which were to become celebrated after 1964 . 
Gaitskell had felt disturbed by this trend in the 50s . 
He associated it with the decline of the old service ethic of the upper middle class : `` Tony -LRB- Crosland -RRB- and Roy are not upper and I sometimes feel they do n't have a proper humility to ordinary working people . '' 
The receding tide of Puritanism on the one hand , and noblesse oblige on the other , also had its grosser side . 
Alan Watkins recalls that as a young reporter , lunch with a politician often involved `` a large aperitif beforehand , sharing a bottle of wine with the meal and ... brandy afterwards with his coffee . '' 
New Labor would probably be as appalled as their Edwardian ancestors . 
The thoughtful accounts found in Roy Jenkins : A Retrospective , edited by Andrew Adonis and Keith Thomas -LRB- OUP , # 18.99 -RRB- , that deal with Jenkins 's detachment from Labor after the electoral defeat of 1970 , read more like a tale of accident and misadventure than of the irresistible rise of a new political force . 
Like Bevan in the 50s , Jenkins was a reluctant rebel . 
But for Europe and his absence from parliament after the move to Brussels in 1977 , the split with Labor might not have occurred . 
The much-flagged Dimbleby Lecture of 1979 was anything but epic . 
Shirley Williams described it as `` a mildly interesting academic lecture '' . 
But electoral defeat and the ferocity of internecine party warfare , spearheaded by an intolerant Bennite left , appeared to offer `` the Gang of Four '' no point of return . 
Already by 1983 , however , after a spirited challenge at the Warrington byelection and victory at Glasgow , Hillhead , Jenkins was suffering from `` battle fatigue '' . 
And things only got worse as he found himself confronted by the deviousness of David Steel and the surliness of David Owen , whose `` tough and tender '' program Jenkins dubbed `` sub-Thatcherite '' . 
It would be easy to point to Jenkins 's personal weaknesses in recounting this unhappy story . 
But in the end , as the invaluable collection of documents assembled in New Labor 's Old Roots reveals , there was in Labor a collective failure of ethos and aim . 
For in the crisis which produced Labor 's defeat , Bennism and the SDP , the hallucinating reversion of an infantile left to nationalisation and Europhobia was only a symptom of a wider inability to come to terms with the breakdown of what David Marquand calls `` Keynesian social democracy '' . 
This was the belief most elegantly encapsulated in Crosland 's 1956 Future of Socialism that increasing equality could be painlessly achieved through a combination of economic growth and high social spending without a fundamental reform of the institutions and assumptions of the existing state . 
This policy left Labor wholly unprepared to deal with it , and in part even fuelled `` the mounting inflation , swelling balance of payments deficits , unprecedented currency depreciation , rising unemployment , bitter industrial conflict and ebbing governability '' for which the Wilson-Callaghan years are remembered . 
By republishing the incisive essays of Mackintosh , Marquand , Radice and others , Diamond rightly emphasises that the revision of Croslandite assumptions about social-democracy was as crucial as the need to revise Clause Four . 
But to get the full measure of this problem which still lurks just beneath the surface of New Labor , we need to set it in a longer time-frame . 
For `` revisionism '' did not begin in 1994 , not even with Gaitskell in 1960 , but at least as far back as 1918 . 
Labor before 1914 did not aspire to power . 
It was a party committed to defend the trade unions ' right to organise and secure parliamentary representation . 
Commitment to public ownership in 1918 was a `` revision '' put forward not by utopians or Marxists , but by sober-minded Fabians and hard-headed trade union leaders , convinced - as was Lenin - by the practical successes of state control of wartime industry . 
During the inter-war years and well into the 40s , there was no Labor intellectual , be it Tawney , Durbin , Dalton or Gaitskell , who did not believe in the superiority of a planned economy with a large measure of public ownership . 
But public ownership was not the defining point of socialism . 
It only became so during the 50s when Bevan equated it with a commitment to Clause Four in contrast to Crosland 's emphasis upon equality . 
If these were the decisive doctrinal turning points in Labor 's history before 1960 , the period between Gaitskell and `` New Labor '' delivered a massive blow to each of these three possible foundations for Labor advance : first , the assumption crucial to Clause Four , that socialist planned economies were superior , widely believed in the 30s and still present in the Labor National Plan of 1964 , disappeared in the following 20 years as the economic inefficiency of Soviet communism became increasingly apparent . 
Second , the privileged legal position of trade unions , first established in the 1870s and reinforced by the foundation of the Labor party in 1900 , was discredited by trade union militancy in `` the winter of discontent '' and dismantled by Thatcher and Norman Tebbit in the bitter aftermath of the 1983 miners ' strike . 
Lastly , Keynesian assumptions about economic management upon which Crosland 's egalitarian strategy depended were destroyed by the economic crises of the 1970s . 
Seen in this way , it becomes clear that `` New Labor '' is not really new ; yet equally clear that `` the roots '' to which the party might wish to return are frail or no longer existent . 
The question that destroyed the coherence and ultimately the existence of the SDP was what to put in place of the defense of the trade unions , Clause Four or Crosland 's vision of equality . 
So far , `` New Labor '' has managed to keep this question at bay , just as Harold Wilson deferred the question of Clause Four for more than a decade . 
It has done so by good economic management , by the wooing of middle England through the black arts of triangulation and spin , and by the modest , but real commitment to the reduction of poverty , both nationally and internationally . 
But should the bad times ever return - Iraq and possible economic downturn suggest they might - `` New Labor '' would do well to start thinking now about an alternative basis for a politics of equality .

2005-03-20,"Johnson Beharry was last week awarded the Victoria Cross for his acts of bravery during the Iraq war . 
Peter Beaumont and Jason Burke ask what factors - physical , psychological and moral - create a heroic act The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Sunday March 27 , 2005 In the article below we said Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay were awarded the VC for their role in the attack on Goose Green . 
In fact , Sergeant McKay 's VC was awarded for his bravery during an attack on an enemy position on Mount Longdon , an objective in the battle for Port Stanley . 
` Heroism ' , wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson , ` is an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual 's character . ' 
It is a mystery , war 's great enigma - what is it that makes one man run , another stand his ground , and an exceptional few display unusual courage . 
That conundrum - of what makes a hero - was posed again last week as a young Grenadan-born private from the 1st Battalion of The Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment , Johnson Beharry , was presented with the Victoria Cross , Britain 's highest award for military gallantry , for the bravery he showed in two separate actions in Iraq last year . 
He is only the 1,354 th recipient since the medal was instituted in 1854 - and only the 11th since the end of the Second World War . 
And what underlies that question of heroism is not simply the details of his extraordinary valor as they were detailed last week , but by the pictures of Beharry himself . 
They showed an open , easy and smiling face - comfortable , perhaps even a little shy - reinforcing his humanity . 
They were pictures that insisted that we ask : what was it that made this ordinary man do such extraordinary things ? 
It is a question , in truth , as old as writing and humanity itself - and one that only now scientists are beginning to understand . 
Homer took it as his theme in the Iliad , his depiction of the characters of two great and flawed warriors - Achilles and Hector - while Plato and Aristotle dissected what it meant for the citizen soldier . 
The Old Testament authors presented their own archetypes for heroism , none more powerfully described than David 's struggle against Goliath . 
In the last century , however , biologists and social scientists , physiologists and psychologists began to attempt to define Emerson 's ` secret impulse ' and the core nature of heroism itself . 
It is a question that has been muddied by the fact that the idea of heroism at any time is defined by broader social values and shifting cultural perceptions . 
The traditional meaning that accrued to it in the field of military endeavor was , perhaps , best expressed by Churchill 's physician , Lord Moran , who took two views of courage in his book , The Anatomy of Courage - as a ` true virtue ' , and as a special case of self-control . 
He rejected , too , the idea of courage as a constant . 
Instead he took the view that it was inevitably exhaustible . 
Most of all , believed Moran , it had to involve a conscious decision . 
` Courage is a moral quality , ' wrote Lord Moran . 
` It is not a chance gift of nature like an aptitude for games . 
It is a cold choice between two alternatives , the fixed resolve not to quit ; an act of renunciation which must be made not once but many times by the power of the will . ' 
It is a definition that could have been written for Johnson Beharry . 
The story of Beharry 's heroism , however , is doubly meaningful because his story transcends the traditional idea of martial valor - that its function is violence alone - and incorporates more modern civil notions that real heroes are just those ordinary people who put themselves at risk to help others . 
The 24-year-old armored vehicle driver was at the head of a five-vehicle convoy that came under attack on the outskirts of the central Iraqi city of Amara on the night of 1 May last year . 
The vehicle Beharry was driving was hit by a barrage of rocket-propelled grenades , leaving the platoon commanding officer unconscious and presumed dead , and engulfing the vehicle in flames . 
Beharry , determined to get the casualties to safety and create a path for the other vehicles to follow , rammed a barricade and drove on through thick smoke and a mile-long ambush with his protective hatch blasted open . 
He eventually delivered the troops to a secure area , twice returning to the vehicle under fire to carry the wounded inside a compound . 
Weeks later , his Warrior was ambushed again and a rocket exploded six inches away from him , causing serious head injuries . 
He managed to reverse the Warrior and its occupants out of danger before collapsing into a coma . 
They were actions that meant Beharry would become the first living recipient of a Victoria Cross -LRB- VC -RRB- since 1965 , and the first to get the medal since the 1982 Falklands conflict when Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay were awarded the VC posthumously for their role in the attack on Goose Green . 
Indeed , military experts believe that the award of the VC to Beharry signalled a recognition of the change in the army 's role . 
` For a long time the feeling was that the Victoria Cross should be reserved for gallantry in conventional war rather than the `` low-intensity conflicts '' that the British Army has primarily been involved in recently , ' said Andrew Dorman , a lecturer in Defense Studies at King 's College London . 
Dorman said last week 's VC showed a recognition both that ` extreme gallantry is the same whatever ' , a belief recognized by Beharry 's fellow soldiers , who launched the campaign for him to be given the Victoria Cross after senior officers recommended him for honors . 
But was there something in Beharry 's background that conditioned him for courage ? 
The son of a Grenadan brickmaker who came to the United Kingdom in 1999 , Johnson grew up in a wooden hut without running water that he shared with his parents and seven brothers and sisters . 
In interviews last week , his parents said that Johnson , who had enjoyed playing childhood war-games with his friends , had always dreamed of joining the British Army , leaving school at 14 . 
Beharry 's modest upbringing is one that he shares with other soldiers who have displayed the highest gallantry in war , including Audie Murphy , America 's most decorated soldier of World War Two , whose parents were dirt-poor sharecroppers , and Albert Jacka VC , the Australian hero of Gallipoli , a forestry labourer who rose rapidly through the ranks . 
Yet none of this explains why some people are predisposed to be courageous , and in a way the majority are not . 
This question has obsessed military commanders from the first decade of the last century onwards as they enlisted the new social sciences to try to find ways of persuading soldiers to be more aggressive - courageous in the traditional military sense . 
It is the search for the roots of courage that was chronicled by Joanna Bourke of Birkbeck College in her book An Intimate History of Killing . 
` There was a problem : the instinct of self-preservation was as liable to lead to `` flight '' as to `` fight '' , ' wrote Bourke about the early attempts to understand valor . 
` To overcome this , military psychologists coupled instinct theory with the crowd psychology of men like Gustave Le Bon and his English populariser , Wilfred Trotter . 
` Humans were herd animals , with strong gregarious impulses . 
In a crowd - and the army was only a trained crowd - the `` group mind '' would take over , endowing the individual with a sense of almost limitless power and immortality . ' 
That was the theory for a while at least . 
But it still did not explain why some soldiers were prepared to take more risks than others . 
By the Fifties , research was hinting at other explanations . 
The British psychologist , Hans Eysenck , developed a scale to measure the personality trait of extroversion , now regarded by psychologists as one of the most consistent predictors of risk-taking . 
Other physical studies , meanwhile , were beginning to reveal that the brain not only craved arousal , but somehow could regulate that arousal at an optimal level . 
Over the next three decades , researchers extended these early findings into a host of theories about risk-taking . 
It led scientists , including Frank Farley in the US , to identify risk-takers as a whole new ` personality type ' - Type-A - which he subdivided into T-negative and T-positive , to distinguish between productive and destructive risk-taking : between the heroic tendency and the nihilistic . 
Biologists too were making critical breakthroughs in explaining those predisposed to risk-taking behavior , discovering the action of an enzyme called monoamine oxidase -LRB- MAO -RRB- in regulating arousal in the brain , with scientists discovering low levels of the enzyme in the brains of those dubbed High Sensation Seekers . 
All of which suggests that military courage , of the kind understood by Moran , is a deeply complex coincidence of the physical , social and the moral ; of nature and nurture ; of instinct and that which is learned . 
But for all the mystery of what courage is and where it comes from , one thing about it is immutable : it is the use of valor to reinforce what a society feels about its values , from Homer 's celebration of the valor of Greek and Trojan warriors , to Australia 's lionisation of Albert Jacka and the mythologising in the public mind of Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones . 
The soldier 's story is being seen as a magnificent public relations opportunity for the army , which has been hit by scandals involving the abuse and death of recruits at Deepcut Barracks and the mistreatment of prisoners in Iraq . 
Though the army is only 500 men below its ideal strength of 104,000 , an initial surge in recruitment that followed the war in Iraq has now fallen away and , as is usual after a war , experienced soldiers are leaving . 
` Beharry was incredibly brave , incredibly competent and incredibly committed . 
His story is a great advertisement for today 's army and everyone 's very pleased about that , ' one retired senior officer told The Observer . 
And Beharry 's heroism can help in other ways . 
The forces have made repeated efforts to reach out to minorities . 
Last week the head of Britain 's armed forces made a direct appeal to the country 's Islamic community to encourage more Muslims to join up . 
General Sir Michael Walker , the chief of defense staff , said he was personally committed to ` creating armed forces which reflect more fully the society we serve ' . 
Beharry , his great smiling face appearing on the front of newspapers , can mean far more to the creation of an image of the army as a diverse organization than any set of new statistics or new policies . 
For the soldiers themselves it is a different state of affairs . 
For them heroism is best summed up by the speech of Clearchos to his soldiers in Xenophon 's Anabasis . ' 
I will go with you and suffer whatever I must suffer . 
For I consider that you are my country and my friends and comrades ; and with you , I think I shall be honored wherever I may be , but without you I think I am not able either to help a friend or hurt an enemy . 
Where you go , there I will go also : that is my resolve . '

2005-03-21,"Monday 21 March 2005 02.47 GMT The BBC last night gave another sign that it is determined to maintain its editorial independence by screening a Panorama program strongly critical of Tony Blair 's manipulation of thin intelligence , on the second anniversary of the invasion of Iraq . 
In the program , Sir Richard Dearlove , the head of MI6 , was reported as having told Mr Blair that Washington had fixed policy on a war against Iraq and was going to fit the intelligence around that policy . 
Despite the humiliation of losing its director general , Greg Dyke , over its allegations concerning David Kelly , the government arms control officer , the film contained powerful condemnation of the government . 
It included interviews with former officials who had al ready broken in public with the government 's Iraq strategy . 
It also quoted extensively from leaked documents first revealed by the Daily Telegraph . 
In the most startling revelation , the program claimed that at a meeting on July 23 2002 , Sir Richard said a war was inevitable , adding that the facts and the intelligence were being fixed round the policy set out by George Bush 's administration . 
The claim was based on several reliable sources , Panorama said . 
It claimed that Sir Richard briefed Mr Blair that the quality of intelligence sourcing for some claims made in the run-up to the publication of the intelligence dossier was developmental , adding : `` The source remains unproven . '' 
Nevertheless , Mr Blair told MPs two weeks later : `` The intelligence picture they paint is one accumulated over the past four years . 
It is extensive , detailed and authoritative . '' 
The program also claimed that British intelligence was unable to convince neutral members of the UN security council , such as Mexico , of the dangers of Iraq 's stockpile of weapons of mass destruction . 
The program quoted Adolfo Zinser , former Mexican ambassador to the UN , referring to a meeting with MI6 . 
Mr Zinser said : `` I asked them : ` Do you have full proof of the existence of these weapons at any one of these particular sites that you are referring to ? 
The MI6 officers told me : `` No. '' Mr Zinser added : `` It was very clear they did n't have proof , they had circumstantial evidence of a funny behavior , of a suspicious behavior . 
But I knew that ... because that was what we were getting from the -LRB- UN -RRB- inspectors . '' 
The program also interviewed Sir Stephen Wall , Mr Blair 's former European adviser , who said of the legal case for war : `` We stretched the legal argument to breaking point , and the fact that we do not have authority does set a dangerous precedent . '' 
Sir Stephen also alleged that No 10 wilfully misrepresented remarks by the French president , Jacques Chirac , on the eve of war to suggest that France would never support a second UN resolution necessary to go to war .

2005-03-22,"` I 'll hold Blair to account ' Reg Keys was n't interested in politics until his son Tom was killed in Iraq in a war he insists was ` illegal and immoral ' . 
Which makes him the ideal candidate to stand against the prime minister in his Sedgefield constituency , he tells Stuart Jeffries `` I 've always been a great fan of Muhammad Ali and his philosophy , '' says Reg Keys . 
`` Whenever he got into the ring with Sonny Liston or George Foreman , nobody gave him a chance . 
But he always believed that he could win . 
And , when it really mattered , he did . '' 
These are words that may well give Tony Blair a chill . 
For Keys intends to stand against the prime minister in his Sedgefield constituency in the general election , which is likely to be held on May 5 . 
And Keys is n't just the run-of-the-mill , third-rate Tory candidate who usually contests safe Labor seats like Sedgefield ; rather , he is someone who believes he has the singular moral authority to defeat Blair at the polls for taking Britain to war in Iraq . 
For several weeks now , a group of Westminster MPs , along with the musician and record producer - and former Blairite - Brian Eno , have been looking for an independent candidate with sufficient clout to topple Blair from his safe seat in County Durham . 
Their aim was to find someone akin to Martin Bell , the former BBC reporter who , as an independent candidate , ousted the disgraced Conservative MP for Tatton , Neil Hamilton , in 1997 . 
In Keys , a 52-year-old retired ambulance training manager from the West Midlands , they believe they have found their man . 
`` Unlike Martin Bell , I do n't wear a white suit and I 'm not used to the media . 
I 've got a Midlands accent and I 'm an introvert , '' says Keys . 
`` I 'm not exactly what you 'd expect of a politician , but I do know that I can embarrass Tony Blair . '' 
The reason he believes this is that Keys is a bereaved father who has entered the political process not out of personal ambition but to honor the memory of his dead son . 
Lance Corporal Tom Keys was a British military policeman killed by a 500-strong mob of Iraqis in the volatile Shia city of al Majarr al Kabir in June 2003 . 
Keys believes that his son went to Iraq trusting the false prospectus for war that Blair set before the House of Commons . 
`` I want to hold Tony Blair to account for his deceit , '' he says . 
`` I remember the last time I saw Tom , at New Street Station in Birmingham in February 2003 , when he marched off down that platform with his chest puffed out , proud to be off to do his duty for Britain . 
He believed what he was told ... But Blair lied to him , and to all those other 84 soldiers who came home in coffins after fighting in a war that was illegal and immoral . '' 
Does he really believe that he can topple the prime minister in a constituency where , historically , they do n't so much count Labor votes as weigh them ? 
`` I have got to believe that I can . 
Whenever I have any doubts about what I am doing I just think about Tom . 
I just think of when I dressed Tom and brushed his hair when his remains were returned to me , his body riddled with bullet holes . 
`` I suppose the Paxman question is ` Why are you standing in Sedgefield - you 're not from there at all ? ' 
But it 's also true that Tony Blair is n't a local . 
He was educated in Scotland and lives in London . 
Yes , he has a house in the constituency , but the only time he comes to Sedgefield is when he 's with his posh friends and he wants a photo opportunity . 
I am as local as he is . '' 
Keys longs for a face-to-face debate with Blair about the war . 
`` I would love that challenge . 
If he believes his actions were just and that no ministerial codes were broken , then he has nothing to fear . 
I do n't believe , though , that he has nothing to hide . 
He knew that the intelligence that was used to justify war was shaky . '' 
Keys had originally intended to stand against Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon in his Ashfield constituency . 
`` Then I met this hostage negotiator called Felicity Arbuthnot who worked with -LRB- the murdered aid worker -RRB- Margaret Hassan , and she said , why not stand against Blair ? 
She put me in touch with Brian Eno and some of his friends , and I realized that it would be a good idea . '' 
Who 's bankrolling your campaign ? 
`` Well , not Brian Eno . 
He 's given us his moral support and let us use his studio in London , but he is n't backing us financially . 
So far we 're just surviving on minor donations of # 100 and # 200 , but hopefully we 'll get some bigger donations as the campaign goes on . 
I 'm struggling to pay the # 50-a-night bed and breakfast bills . '' 
He says that a local pub has offered him the free use of a back room as campaign headquarters . 
Not the Dun Cow , the Sedgefield pub where Blair has entertained several world leaders in recent years ? 
`` No , the pub which offered us the room does n't want its name disclosed . '' 
The question now is whether Keys and his supporters can encourage other political parties that had intended to contest Sedgefield to stand down so that he can get a straight fight with Blair . 
`` The Tory candidate has already stood down . 
I do n't know for certain whether they 're going to put anyone else up in their place , but I think it 's unlikely , '' says Keys . 
`` I 'm not sure whether the Lib Dems are going to stand , but I am hoping that we can negotiate with them . 
Already an anti-war independent candidate has decided to throw his weight - both moral and financial - behind me . '' 
He also hopes to convince another potential independent candidate , the former spy David Shayler , to stand down . 
`` We 're trying to have a negotiation with him , but it may be that he has a book he wants to promote . '' 
Yesterday , Keys arrived in Sedgefield to test the water for his campaign . 
It would take a 22 % swing for him to defeat Blair , who , in 2001 , was elected with a majority of 17,713 . 
What struck him about the town ? 
`` It was how run down the school playgrounds looked , and it just made me think of the # 5bn that was wasted on the war , how far money like that would have gone in making places for our children to play properly . '' 
Is n't Sedgefield a constituency from which many British soldiers come and so would have strong views about your campaign ? 
`` That 's right . 
What amazed me , though , is that some people I have spoken to need to be educated . 
Some seemed to think that Saddam was involved in 9\/11 and that there were weapons of mass destruction . '' 
He says that one of the first people he met was a soldier on leave . 
`` He was just a young lad , like my son Tom was . 
And he really disagreed with what I was doing . 
He said : ' I signed on the dotted line , so no one can really complain when I 'm killed on active service . ' 
`` I can understand him saying that . 
But what happened with Tom was that he was killed in the middle of a war we should n't have been fighting , and killed in a manner that showed the army had underestimated the danger of the situation into which they were sending those young men . 
Tom had , when he was 18 , been part of a mission with the SAS to rescue a regiment . 
Had he been killed in that action , no argument . 
Or had he been killed by a weapon of mass destruction while on active service in Iraq , no argument . 
But he was n't . '' 
Keys argues that his son died as part of an army blunder . 
`` Three weeks before Tom was killed , the army had what it called a ` scale down ' . 
They took away his morphine , grenades and all his ammunition except just 50 rounds . 
It also took away the radio masts , so that all they had were vehicle-mounted , year-old Clansman radios , which were notoriously unreliable . 
They tried to get hold of satellite phones but for some reason they were refused . 
`` In that condition he was sent to this volatile Shia city where he and his section found a violent mob of 500 heading for the police station . 
They did n't have a chance . 
The Iraqi police fled , but Tom and the rest of them fought until they had no more ammunition . 
Then they were killed by a mob in a ritualistic fashion , which is common there . '' 
All six of the British Red Caps were murdered . 
`` There were no medals or honor for them . 
There was no letter from Tony Blair . 
Instead , he managed to find time to write a letter of condolence for Ozzy Osbourne when he fell off his quad bike . 
But not to my son , who was shot 31 times . 
I ca n't help but think angrily about that , and about Tom 's beautiful green eyes . 
He was four days short of his 21st birthday . '' 
He does have happier memories . 
`` Before Tom went to Iraq , everything was rosy . 
We were a family of four . 
I had retired , as had my wife , who was a hospital ward manager . 
We had moved to a barn conversion in Bala in north Wales . 
All that life has been ruined for us . '' 
Is it difficult to be a political candidate in these circumstances , when you are still clearly grieving ? 
`` Yes it is . 
It 's worse for my wife . 
We 're both very fragile , but it is worse for her . 
My son is buried in a beautiful grave at Llanaber near Barmouth in Wales . 
A very picturesque spot overlooking the sea . 
But my wife ca n't bring herself to go there . 
She ca n't quite bring herself to see his name on the grave . 
It 's too final . 
`` I feel , though , that I have a responsibility to Tom . 
I keep going back to the words of a widow of a man who died on the Kursk -LRB- the Soviet nuclear submarine whose crew perished in 2000 in an underwater disaster after a leakage of torpedo motor fuel exploded -RRB- . 
She said : ` If you betray your country you are a traitor and you will go to prison . 
But if your country betrays you , what can you do ? ' 
I think I have an answer to that : we can use our vote to get rid of those people who betrayed my son and other men like him . 
That 's what I want the people of Sedgefield to do . ''

2005-03-23,"Wednesday 23 March 2005 16.08 GMT Group Captain Al Lockwood , who was the official military spokesman during the Iraq war . 
Photograph : PA The Conservatives today picked a former RAF group captain who served in Iraq to fight Tony Blair in his Sedgefield constituency at the forthcoming general election . 
The prime minister will face Group Captain Al Lockwood - who appeared on TV screens as a military spokesman during the conflict - in his north-east constituency . 
In a local contest which is shaping up to focus on Iraq , Mr Blair will also face anti-war candidate Reg Keys , the father of a killed military policeman , and David Shayler , the ex-MI5 spy turned campaigner , who have declared their intention to stand against him . 
Today the Tories officially selected Group Capt Lockwood to take on Mr Blair 's seemingly impregnable 17,000 majority , after their former candidate , Danny Kruger , dropped out following the Guardian 's revelation that he had called for a `` period of creative destruction '' in the public services . 
The former fighter pilot , currently living in Lincolnshire , left the RAF earlier this year and has chosen to pursue a career in politics . 
The 53-year-old 's face was beamed into millions of British households during the Iraq conflict two years ago in his role as the official military spokesman . 
He said today : `` I am proud and honored to have been selected as the prospective Conservative candidate for Sedgefield . 
`` I am looking forward to the challenges ahead and relishing the opportunity to take on Tony Blair . '' 
`` Since this government came to power the people of Sedgefield have been subjected to an increased tax burden of 60 % . 
`` Mr Blair promised to cut crime , improve school standards and not to raise taxes but he has failed to deliver . 
The people of Sedgefield have a unique opportunity to send a signal to Mr Blair at the next election . 
`` Seven years of failing to deliver on his promises is long enough . 
It 's time for him to go . '' 
Mr Blair 's agent , John Burton , responded today : `` The Tories can change their candidate but they can not change their policies , they are still going to cut # 35bn from the public services budget . '' 
Mr Shayler and Mr Keys are expected to meet soon to see if one is willing to drop out to leave just one anti-war candidate . 
Mr Shayler said earlier he intended to challenge the prime minister on the `` illegal '' invasion of Iraq . 
Mr Keys , whose son , Lance Corporal Tom Keys , was one of six Red Caps killed by a mob in a small police station in Al Majar Al Kabir in June 2003 , also intends to bring Iraq to the forefront of the election , and said he wanted `` justice '' for his son . 
Meanwhile , in the national election battle , Labor 's election chief , Alan Milbur , n accused Michael Howard of drafting in a `` dodgy '' Australian aide . 
Mark Textor , an Australian colleague of the controversial Tory strategist Lynton Crosby , is expected to arrive in the UK in time for the start of the official election campaign . 
Mr Textor has been accused of using `` push polling '' in Australia , where telephone canvassing is used to camouflage disseminating misinformation about the opposition . 
Mr Milburn addressed what he termed the `` Australian question '' at a Labor press conference . 
`` Mr Howard 's campaign is being run by an Australian . 
Another Australian is about to arrive , someone who has a pretty dodgy track record and reputation . '' 
The pair were a `` fly-by-night operation '' he said , and Mr Howard was `` flitting from issue to issue , enhancing his reputation as a serial opportunist '' , he added . 
A Tory spokesman accused Mr Milburn of attempting to `` divert attention '' from campaign issues . 
`` Lynton Crosby and Mark Textor are both very talented campaigners , '' he said . 
Mr Milburn 's deputy , Fraser Kemp , raised the issue yesterday but a Conservative spokesman stressed : `` They did not do it . '' 
The spokesman added : `` We would never do it here . ''

2005-03-24,"Suppressed passage suggests that attorney general still believed invasion was illegal less than two weeks before the troops went in Thursday 24 March 2005 17.20 GMT The government yesterday tried to suppress evidence that the attorney general believed war against Iraq was illegal less than two weeks before British troops joined the US-led invasion of the country . 
It has removed a key passage in the resignation letter written by Elizabeth Wilmshurst , deputy chief legal adviser at the Foreign Office , on March 18 2003 , the eve of the invasion . 
The remainder of her letter - in which she described the planned invasion as a `` crime of aggression '' - was released yesterday under the Freedom of Information Act . 
The entire letter would have remained secret had not the Guardian published parts of it last month , the FO said . 
The passage suppressed yesterday has now been seen by this newspaper . 
In it , Ms Wilmshurst shows that the attorney , Lord Goldsmith , changed his view on the war twice before the invasion . 
She says that her view that a war would be illegal was the advice which the FO had consistently given before and after the UN security council resolution 1441 , agreed in November 2002 . 
She says that was also Lord Goldsmith 's view until March 7 , when he sent a 13-page written legal opinion to Tony Blair . 
Ms Wilmshurst does not reveal the content of this advice . 
However , reports that the at torney warned Mr Blair that British participation in the invasion could be ruled unlawful by an international court have not been denied by the government . 
In the censored passage of her letter , Ms Wilmshurst points out that the attorney 's view changed yet again into a new `` official line '' . 
That is a reference to a parliamentary answer released by Lord Goldsmith on March 17 , the eve of a crucial Commons vote on military action . 
In this , the attorney said - on the basis of advice from Mr Blair - that it was `` plain '' Iraq was in breach of its disarmament obligations . 
In the rest of her letter , Ms Wilmshurst , now on the staff of Chatham House , the Royal Institute of International Affairs , said she could not `` in conscience '' go along with the view that an invasion would be lawful without a second UN resolution clearly sanctioning war . 
Such a resolution , which Mr Blair was desperate to get , was not forthcoming . 
As that became clear , both Jack Straw , the foreign secretary , and Lord Goldsmith changed their view . 
Ms Wilmshurst described planned military action against Iraq as `` so detrimental to the international order and the rule of law '' . 
She also referred to her work , specifically negotiations on the `` crime of aggression '' . 
The FO yesterday cited exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act to justify sup pressing parts of the Wilmshurst letter . 
They covered `` the formulation or development of government policy '' , `` ministerial communications '' , and `` the provision of advice by any of the law officers '' . 
The FO also referred to an exemption relating to `` information in respect of which a claim to legal professional privilege _ could be maintained in legal proceedings '' . 
It said it was not in the `` public interest '' to release the deleted passage of the Wilmshurst letter . 
However , critics suggested the government had tried to censor the Wilmshurst letter . 
Sir Menzies Campbell QC , Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , said last night : `` The whole letter suggests that the attorney general went from a position of believing military action to be illegal to a more equivocal view and finally to a conclusion that military action would be legal . '' 
The former international development secretary Clare Short told Channel 4 News last night : `` I think the government had to try and cover it up because it is so devastating . 
`` The bit that was blacked out shows that the attorney general changed his mind twice in a matter of days before he gave advice to the cabinet when he just said unequivocally , ` My view is that there is legal authority for war ' , and kept from the cabinet any suggestion that he had had doubts about it . ''

2005-03-25,"Kofi Annan is embarking on an immediate and full-scale lobbying campaign to persuade members of the United Nations to adopt what he calls `` the most far-reaching reforms in the history of the UN '' . 
The UN secretary general 's blueprint for change , outlined on Monday , recommends abolishing the controversial human rights commission , enlarging the security council from 15 to 24 seats , setting new rules for military intervention , tightening oversight of the UN 's contracts and sanctions programs , and creating a new peace-building body to strengthen civil society in countries ravaged by conflict . 
Contained in a 63-page draft report to the general assembly , entitled In Larger Freedom : Towards Development , Security and Human Rights For All , the reform package ran into prompt criticism from several countries . 
But Mr Annan insisted that his plans should not be seen as an `` la carte menu '' from which member states took only the bits they liked . 
`` It 's going to take lots of work , lots of work here in this building with the permanent representatives , lots of work with capitals , with the heads of state and government , lots of work by certain envoys that I hope to send out , '' he said . 
`` I believe that , as difficult as it is , the member states -- the majority of the member states -- will come to conclude that what is on the table ... is in their long-term interest and go along with it , '' he added , noting at one point that this included the US . 
After the fierce divisions over the Iraq war , corruption in the oil-for-food program , and sexual abuse scandals involving peacekeepers , the reform package lifts the UN back on to the high ground of global concerns . 
It is an effort to find common ground between North and South . 
It tries to meet the priorities of rich countries , which put most store by security against terrorism and nuclear proliferation , and poor states more concerned with poverty and disease . 
Mr Annan warns that a catastrophic terrorist act in a big western city could undermine poorer countries ' economies , while an outbreak of disease in a poor region could spread to the developed world . 
The report gives equal weight to the UN 's three basic purposes : development , security and human rights . 
In the introduction Mr Annan says : `` We will not enjoy development without security , we will not enjoy security without development , and we will not enjoy either without respect for human rights . 
Unless all these causes are advanced , none will succeed . '' 
The report 's most radical proposal , to end the human rights commission , fits in with Bush administration wishes . 
In place of the commission , which meets for only six weeks a year , it proposes a smaller and less politicised council that can meet regularly . 
Mr Annan says the existing commission has `` been increasingly undermined by its declining credibility and professionalism '' . 
Echoing Washington 's argument , he said some states had sought membership on the commission `` not to strengthen human rights , but to protect themselves against criticism , or to criticise others '' . 
Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International applauded the proposal but said that any reforms should retain independent investigators and an ability for witnesses and victims to testify . 
Other controversial recommendations build on those of a high-level panel that Mr Annan set up last year to study security threats and challenges . 
It called for international agreement on a new definition of terrorism to outlaw all attacks on civilians , and proposed a change in the balance between state sovereignty and the right of states to intervene . 
The plan for a universal definition of terrorism ran into criticism from Algeria and other Arab states , who fear it may rule out the right of armed resistance to foreign occupation . 
In a move that will please developing countries , the report calls for new powers for the economic and social council that many feel has been sidelined by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund . 
It should hold annual ministerial-level meetings to review progress towards the UN millennium development goals , Mr Annan says . 
France 's UN ambassador , Jean-Marc de la Sabliere , summed up general reaction to the report when he said it was `` ambitious but achievable '' .

2005-03-26,"For one day only , I 'm a Lib Dem We must take the politics of the anti-war front into the electoral arena Saturday 26 March 2005 00.35 GMT The crucial events that led to the occupation of Iraq by the US and Britain are now classified , proven and documented . 
Tony Blair and his New Labor cohorts , backed by their Conservative allies , lied without shame to drag a reluctant country to war . 
A dung-heap of `` facts '' was manufactured by Alastair Campbell and hurled at television and the print media . 
Those who questioned them were traduced and harassed . 
The million and a half who marched to try to prevent the war were ignored . 
Despite the rushed and half-baked elections , a savage chaos still grips the country . 
The Archbishop of Canterbury remains silent . 
After the 2001 election , but well before 9\/11 , Rowan Williams offered the following advice to the nation : `` Without the perspective of religion our whole politics is likely to be in deep trouble . '' 
The cost of the Iraqi adventure was heavy . 
According to a team of medical investigators sent by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , more than 100,000 Iraqi civilians died . 
Torture , encouraged from above , became a fact of life . 
Perhaps some good liberal apologist for Blair will soon explain how democratic torture is much nicer than authoritarian torture . 
Perhaps the belligerati could take this further . 
Ian McEwan 's next novel could sensitively depict dilemmas of a liberal torturer faced with the barbaric Orient . 
We live , after all , in a world where illusions are sacred and truth profane . 
Meanwhile , as some -LRB- non-Labour -RRB- MPs contemplate impeaching Blair for lying and other misdemeanors , a general election draws near in Britain . 
What are we going to do ? 
If Blair wins this election -LRB- as appears likely -RRB- , he will claim , like Bush , that the country supports him in these difficult times . 
It is for this reason that those who opposed the war must think carefully before they cast their votes . 
Abstention is not a serious option . 
The aim should be to return an anti-war majority to the House of Commons . 
This requires tactical\/intelligent voting in every constituency . 
Normally , people vote to assert their political sympathies . 
But this is not a normal general election . 
It will be the first opportunity to punish the warmongers and , given the undemocratic voting system , the votes cast for the Greens , Respect and others will have no impact , with a possible exception in Bethnal Green and Bow , east London , where George Galloway confronts the warmonger Oona King . 
It is possible that in some constituencies the Green\/Respect vote could ensure the return of a warmonger , as we have seen in the odd byelection . 
So why not treat this election as special and take the politics of the broad anti-war front to the electoral arena ? 
If the result is a hung parliament or a tiny Blair majority , it will be seen as a victory for our side . 
Blair has led this country into more wars than Thatcher and Major combined . 
He is responsible for more deaths than his Tory predecessors and with fewer popular votes to back him . 
In 1992 , the year Neil Kinnock was defeated by John Major , the Labor vote was 11.5 million . 
In 2001 , New Labor 's indecent majority was based on a popular vote of 10.7 million . 
Turnout dropped from 71 % in 1997 to 59 % in 2001 . 
The rival claimant to the throne , Gordon Brown , provided a hallucinatory explanation : people were so relaxed and happy under New Labor that they could n't be bothered to vote . 
Psephology beckons , Gordon . 
In reality , it was the collapse of the Tories that distorted the results . 
New Labor 's massive majorities have been based on mass abstentions and a blatantly undemocratic electoral system . 
The assault on civil liberties mounted by Blair and Blunkett is far more serious than the appalling internment without trial that Edward Heath instituted during the Troubles . 
The tribal notion that New Labor is somehow qualitatively better than the Tories is pure sentimentality . 
It is not supported by the facts . 
With the abandonment of anything resembling traditional social democracy , New Labor has concentrated on intrigue , treachery and infamy . 
How else can one characterise the long Blair-Brown struggle for mastery of No 10 ? 
Despite the fact that politics has evaporated inside New Labor , the demonstration had its impact . 
A total of 139 Labor MPs voted against the war . 
Robin Cook resigned from the cabinet . 
Clare Short was pushed out . 
George Galloway , the most consistent opponent in parliament , was expelled from the Labor party . 
The Liberal Democrats , Scottish Nationalists and Plaid Cymru voted against as well . 
In constituencies where there are MPs belonging to the anti-war faction , one should vote for them despite disagreements on many other issues . 
In the warmonger constituencies we should vote tactically . 
In my north London constituency , the MP is Barbara Roche : pro-war and pro everything else this wretched government has done . 
I do n't simply want to vote against her . 
I want her to be defeated . 
That is why I will vote Liberal Democrat .

2005-03-30,"The highest-ranking US general in Iraq authorised the use of interrogation techniques that included sleep manipulation , stress positions and the use of dogs to `` exploit Arab fears '' of them , it emerged today . 
A memo signed by Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez authorised 29 interrogation techniques , including 12 that exceeded limits in the army 's own field manual and four that it admitted risked falling foul of international law , the Geneva conventions or accepted standards on the humane treatment of prisoners . 
The memo , dated September 14 2003 , also stated that the Iraq interrogation policy was modelled on the one used at Guantnamo Bay `` but modified for applicability to a theater -LRB- sic -RRB- of war in which the Geneva conventions apply '' . 
On Friday , a US court ordered the papers ' release under the American Freedom of Information Act , following a request by the American Civil Liberties Union . 
`` The memo clearly establishes that Gen Sanchez authorised unlawful interrogation techniques for use in Iraq , and , in particular , these techniques violate the Geneva conventions and the army 's own field manual governing interrogations , '' ACLU lawyer Amrit Singh said in a statement . 
`` He and other high-ranking officials who bear responsibility for the widespread abuse of detainees must be held accountable . '' 
The memo also authorised techniques to alter the environment of prisoners , such as adjusting temperatures or introducing unpleasant smells , in the full knowledge that `` some nations may view application of this technique in certain circumstances to be inhumane '' . 
Another technique , called `` fear-up harsh '' , aimed at `` significantly increasing the fear level of a detainee '' , was also given the green light . 
Yelling , loud music and light control were also cleared `` to create fear , disorientate -LRB- the -RRB- detainee and prolong capture shock '' . 
The existence of the memo had been widely rumored in the wake of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal over the abuse of detainees by US guards . 
The US administration has maintained any abuse was the result of improper individual action and was not sanctioned by leaders . 
The memo also laid out guidance for when the controversial interrogation techniques could be used . 
It stated there should be `` a reasonable basis to believe that the detainee possesses critical intelligence '' . 
Dogs should be muzzled and under the control of a military dog handler `` to prevent contact with -LRB- the -RRB- detainee '' . 
Gen Sanchez ordered that his personal approval should be gained before the most controversial techniques were used . 
He has denied that he gave that permission . 
The ACLU has a lawsuit pending against Gen Sanchez alleging direct responsibility for the torture and abuse of detainees in US military custody . 
The Abu Ghraib scandal , in which US forces physically abused and sexually humiliated Iraqi prisoners at a jail on the outskirts of Baghdad , occurred on during Gen Sanchez 's command . 
Gen George Casey replaced him as top commander in Iraq nine months ago . 
The ACLU said the Pentagon initially refused to release the memo on national security grounds .

2005-03-31,"Thursday 31 March 2005 00.05 BST A final analysis of the intelligence fiasco over Iraq 's non-existent weapons of mass destruction will today focus blame on the CIA and other spy agencies , largely clearing the White House and the Pentagon of allegations that they shaped the intelligence to justify the invasion , according to early accounts of the report . 
The assessment by a presidential commission on WMD intelligence follows 14 months of mostly secret inquiries in an undisclosed location in Virginia . 
It reportedly concentrates on mistakes in a multi-agency assessment in October 2002 , the national intelligence estimate , which portrayed Saddam Hussein 's weapons programs as a serious threat to the US . 
A year-long search by the US Iraq survey group later concluded that those programs had collapsed more than a decade before the invasion . 
The commission is expected to release a 400-page unclassified version of its report after delivering a complete version to George Bush this morning . 
According to leaks , the commission found that many of the intelligence shortcomings on Iraq are being repeated on Iran and North Korea . 
In all three cases , the commission is said to have found that human intelligence - actual spies - are in short supply , and intelligence has relied on satellite pictures , electronic intercepts , the testimony of exiles and guesswork . 
The Los Angeles Times yesterday quoted officials who had read some of the unclassified report as saying it pointed to `` glaring gaps in core US intelligence '' about nuclear programs pursued by Tehran and Pyongyang . 
According to the Washington Post the report will recommend that , in the light of `` group think '' over Iraq , dissent and debate should be encouraged among the nation 's 15 intelligence agencies . 
However , there will be relatively little scrutiny of alleged political pressure by senior administration officials to exaggerate the WMD claims . 
`` There 's nothing really about shaping the intelligence , '' said an intelligence source in Washington familiar with the report . 
A Senate inquiry into political manipulation of intelligence , postponed until after the November elections , now appears to have been quietly dropped by its Republican chairman , Pat Roberts . 
Ray McGovern , a former CIA official and persistent government critic , said the report was diverting the blame . 
`` I see it as part of the continuing attempt to blame the CIA and other intelligence agencies and divert attention away from the White House and the Pentagon . 
It 's worse than Butler -LRB- the inquiry into British intelligence shortcomings -RRB- , or anything you 've had over there . '' 
Dick Cheney made several trips to the CIA 's Langley headquarters in the months before the war to discuss findings on Iraq 's alleged WMD , and the agency 's ombudsman told the Senate that analysts had undergone constant `` hammering '' to come up with a connection between al-Qaida and Saddam . 
However , none of the CIA employees who testified before the Senate intelligence committee on the issue last year admitted changing their analysis to suit the administration 's wishes . 
Today 's report is expected to find that political pressure was not a significant factor , although it will advocate the creation of an ombudsman to hear from analysts who fear their work is being compromised , according to the Washington Post . 
It will reportedly include criticism of the Defense Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency , both under the Pentagon 's control . 
But the burden of blame will fall once more on the CIA . 
`` I 'm told it is going to make the CIA look even worse than before , '' said Melvin Goodman , a former CIA official . 
As for top administration officials , Mr Goodman said : `` It looks like they 're going to escape again . ''

2005-03-31,"US unilateralism was a means of breaking the old order . 
Now it is building new alliances Thursday 31 March 2005 01.37 BST With any new political phenomenon , there is always a tendency to underestimate its novelty and treat it as some kind of short-term aberration . 
I vividly recall how long it took commentators and analysts , on the right and left , to recognize that Thatcherism was something quite new and here to stay . 
Similar doubts greeted the Bush administration and the neocon revolution : its novelty would be short-lived , it would not last and it was just not viable . 
It is always hard to imagine a new kind of world , easier to think of the future as an extension of the past , and difficult to comprehend a paradigm shift and grasp a new kind of logic . 
There was speculation last autumn that the second Bush term would be different , that the breach with Europe would be healed as a matter of necessity , that the US could not afford another Iraq , that somehow the new position was unsustainable . 
Already , however , from last November 's presidential election it was clear that the neocon revolution had wide popular support and serious electoral roots , that it was establishing a new kind of domestic political hegemony . 
In fact , the right has been setting the political agenda in the US for at least 30 years and that is now true with a vengeance . 
All the indications suggest that the revolution is continuing apace . 
The appointment of John Bolton as the US ambassador to the United Nations and the nomination of Paul Wolfowitz as president of the World Bank reveal a determination to place the cadres of the neocon revolution in key positions of power and influence and thereby create the conditions for its continuation and expansion . 
This was heralded almost immediately after the presidential election with the decision to replace Colin Powell , a man of very different political hue , with Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state . 
During the first Bush administration , and especially in its conduct of the Iraq war , the neocon revolution was often characterised as unilateralist , but this was always somewhat simplistic . 
No nation can simply go it alone , certainly not one that seeks to dominate the world . 
However strong it may be , it is still required to pursue its power and ambitions through a system of alliances . 
The end of the cold war led to the realisation that the US was now the world 's sole superpower . 
The period following 9\/11 persuaded the Americans that they now had an opportunity to remake the world in their own image , that the alliances that had been necessary in pursuit of the cold war , notably that with Europe , were no longer appropriate , certainly not on the old terms . 
The US has similarly renounced , or chosen to ignore , many of the international treaties that it had previously been party to - Kyoto , the international criminal court , even the Geneva conventions - either because it no longer believed in them or because it regarded them as a threat to the exercise of a new kind of American power . 
But it would be more accurate to see this unilateralism as a phase rather than a permanent new condition , as a means of breaking the old order rather than a long-term strategy for the new . 
The Bush administration has displayed a differential calculus . 
The heart of its strategy has been concerned with the Middle East where it has deployed a unilateralist policy of pre-emptive strikes and regime change as part of a wider attempt to remake the region . 
The Europeans were disregarded and relegated to the role of bystanders . 
In East Asia , the Americans have behaved quite differently . 
North Korea , like Iraq and Iran , was part of the axis of evil , but there has been no attempt at regime change . 
North Korea 's nuclear weapons , the geographical proximity of Seoul , the opposition of South Korea towards precipitous action , and the role and interest of China , have obliged the Americans to move with caution . 
Far from unilateralism , they have vested their efforts in the six-party talks , and the hope that China might act as a restraining force on Pyongyang . 
In the longer run , China remains the greatest global challenge to the US . 
But here again the Americans have moved with care and restraint . 
They sought to enlist China in the war against terror following 9\/11 , and since then relations between the two have been relatively calm . 
Meanwhile , the Americans will continue to give tacit support to Taiwan and quietly encourage Japan 's growing nationalism as a bulwark against China and a means of protecting their own role in the region . 
It is clear , in this context , that there are three main elements to American unilateralism : Iraq and the Middle East ; the Atlantic alliance ; and the US 's attitude towards international treaties and law . 
Although the Americans flagrantly ignored the Europeans over Iraq , and have loosened the bonds that previously existed in a way that undermines the notion of the west as shaped in the crucible of the cold war , they will seek to build a new relationship with Europe , albeit one far less intimate and far more unequal than before . 
As for Europe , there would appear to be clear limits as to how far it is prepared to go to resist the Americans . 
There are two small defining moments in this process . 
The Europeans may feel decidedly uneasy about Wolfowitz becoming president of the World Bank - with the exception , of course , of Bush 's European lapdog , our prime minister - but they are evidently going to acquiesce . 
American and European dominance of the institutions of the international economy ensures that the two will continue to cooperate , even if the relationship is likely to be more tense and fractious . 
The other example is the European Union 's attitude towards the arms embargo with China . 
Under American pressure , the likely decision to lift it will now be postponed : the ties are still sufficiently strong for Europe not to wish to anger the Americans beyond a certain point . 
The prospects of a drift towards any form of triangulation in the relationship between the US , Europe and China , even at the edges , are still very distant . 
The withdrawal of the US from international treaties does not condemn international law to the dustbin of history . 
It is evident , however , that the Americans are determined either to render these treaties redundant simply by ignoring them , force them to be renegotiated or perhaps both . 
In effect , what the Americans are intent on doing is reordering the world system to take account of their newly defined power and interests . 
Every part of the world is likely to feel the consequences of this geo-political earthquake , but some much more than others . 
The restless determination of the Bush administration to reorder global affairs is well-illustrated by a classified document prepared by the US defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld as a prelude to a massive review of Pentagon spending . 
It requires the military to build a far more proactive force focused on changing the world rather than responding to specific conflicts such as the Korean peninsula . 
It sees the development of very differently trained troops who would be able to intervene on a much more widespread basis . 
`` The idea is that you would have lots of teams operating in lots of places throughout the world , '' a senior defense official was reported as saying . 
At the same time , there is an absolute belief that the US must maintain such a large lead in crucial technologies that growing powers - in other words , China - will decide that it is simply too expensive to try to compete . 
Welcome to the new world order as seen from Washington .

2005-03-31,"Thursday 31 March 2005 00.05 BST Acute malnutrition among Iraqi children aged under five nearly doubled last year because of chaos caused by the US-led occupation , a United Nations expert said yesterday . 
Jean Ziegler , the UN Human Rights Commission 's special expert on the right to food , said more than a quarter of Iraqi children do not have enough to eat and 7.7 % are acutely malnourished - a jump from 4 % recorded in the immediate aftermath of the US-led invasion . 
Reporting to the commission 's headquarters in Geneva , the Swiss professor claimed the situation was `` a result of the war led by coalition forces '' . 
If confirmed , the estimates would be an indictment of an occupation which was supposed to improve the lives of a population crushed by Saddam Hussein . 
Billions of dollars-worth of aid flowed into Iraq from the fall of Saddam Hussein regime 's in April 2003 . 
But the regime 's collapse and widespread violence destroyed jobs and made aid distribution difficult . 
Prof Ziegler based some of his analysis on a US study in October 2004 which estimated that up to 100,000 extra Iraqis , mostly women and children , had died since the invasion than would have been expected to before the war . 
`` Most died as a result of the violence , but many others died as a result of the increasingly difficult living conditions , reflected in increasing child mortality levels , '' he said . 
"
2005-04-01,"A presidential commission investigating the intelligence debacle that preceded the Iraq invasion reported yesterday that the damage done to US credibility would `` take years to undo '' . 
American intelligence was described by the report as being in chaos , often paralysed by the rivalry of 15 different spy agencies and affected by unchallenged assumptions about Baghdad 's supposed weapons of mass destruction . 
The incompetence described in the report occasionally descends into farce , particularly over an Iraqi defector codenamed Curveball , whose fabricated tales about mobile biological laboratories and their influence on US decision-makers were reminiscent of Graham Greene 's accidental spy in Our Man in Havana . 
Despite warnings that he was `` crazy '' , `` a waste of time '' , and that he had not even been in Iraq at the time of an event he supposedly saw , his claims became the subject of almost 100 Defense Intelligence Agency reports and a focus of the National Intelligence Estimate in October 2002 . 
Most critically , Curveball 's description of mobile laboratories provided one of the highlights of Colin Powell 's address to the UN security council on February 5 2003 , in which the then US secretary of state laid out the justification for the invasion . 
Curveball 's story has already been told in part , but yesterday 's account is the most comprehensive . 
He was an Iraqi chemical engineer who was first debriefed in 2000 by a foreign liaison service - not named in yesterday 's report but elsewhere reported as being German intelligence . 
Before the war , the Germans refused to let US interrogators question Curveball directly , saying that he `` would refuse to speak to Americans '' ; they just passed on his claims , according to the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction . 
Warning signs emerged in May 2000 when a military intelligence officer was allowed to visit Curveball . 
He reported : `` I do have a concern with the validity of the information , based on Curveball having a terrible hangover the morning of -LRB- the meeting -RRB- . '' 
The warning fell on deaf ears , but by autumn 2002 the CIA was growing increasingly nervous , knowing it had not met an important source . 
So a meeting was arranged between the local CIA division chief and German intelligence officers . 
When the division chief asked whether US agents could question the defector , `` the foreign intelligence service responded with words to the effect of ` You do n't want to see him because he 's crazy ' - furthermore , the -LRB- German -RRB- representative said that he worried that Curveball was ' a fabricator ' . '' 
The division chief passed on this alarming news to his superiors , but George Tenet , then CIA chief , and his deputy , John McLaughlin , both denied having been told of it . 
On the eve of Mr Powell 's UN speech , Mr Tenet and senior intelligence officers were cloistered with the secretary of state in New York , going over the administration 's claims . 
At midnight Mr Tenet called the division chief at home , but the two men have different recollections of the conversation . 
`` Although he did not remember his exact words , the division chief says that he told Mr Tenet something to the effect of ` You know that the -LRB- foreign service -RRB- reporting has problems ' . 
According to the division chief , Mr Tenet replied with words to the effect of ` Yeah , yeah ' and that he was ` exhausted ' , '' the report says . 
It continues : `` The division chief said that when he listened to the speech ... he was surprised the information from Curveball had been included . '' 
Questioned by the commission , however , Mr Tenet denied that the subject of Curveball had ever been raised . 
Curveball is reportedly related to a senior member of the Iraqi national congress -LRB- INC -RRB- , then an exile group . 
However , the commission found that the INC had not brought him forward . 
The report is another nail in the coffin of Mr Tenet 's reputation and clears the White House and Pentagon of trying to shape intelligence to justify war . 
It concludes : `` The commission found no evidence of political pressure to influence the intelligence community 's prewar assessments of Iraq 's weapons programs . '' 
It warns only of the dangers of intelligence leaders becoming too close to the president and risking the loss of objectivity . 
In other words , the commission found that Mr Tenet had been too eager to please .

2005-04-01,"The Guardian profile : Paul Wolfowitz The intellectual force behind the Bush administration 's neo-conservatives has been trying to charm his critics as he is crowned head of the World Bank . 
But whether he can - or will - put US interests to one side remains to be seen Friday 1 April 2005 00.03 BST For opponents of America 's war on Iraq and fans of Michael Moore , one of the most indelible moments of the film Fahrenheit 9\/11 is when Paul Wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and the intellectual high priest of the Bush administration 's hawks , puts a generous dollop of spit on his comb before smoothing his hair for a television appearance . 
Iffy grooming habits are the least of Wolfowitz 's worries as he takes on the presidency of the World Bank . 
His coronation yesterday was never seriously in doubt - the US is the bank 's largest shareholder . 
But it remains to be seen whether Wolfowitz can overcome the derision and anger that have been heaped on him as the architect of the Iraq war . 
And , after a lifetime spent trying to expand America 's power , is he capable of functioning in a multilateral environment where the focus will not be Washington 's strategic interest , but global poverty ? 
In the fortnight since his nomination , Wolfowitz has worked strenuously to try to temper his reputation as a raging neo-conservative , deploying his not inconsiderable charm to persuade critics in Europe and the Middle East that he does indeed have experience in finance and development , and that he will be able to divorce Washington 's interests from the bank 's . 
Many will prove impossible to convince , seeing in Wolfowitz 's appointment evidence of the White House 's intent to use the World Bank to advance US global interests . 
`` It 's a slap in the face , it 's a poke in the eye . 
It 's bad for the international community in general , and particularly for people already pushed to the brink in poor and marginalised communities , '' says Emira Woods , a fellow at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies . 
`` What this means is that the person who was the architect of the corporate-driven plan for Iraq that failed now gets a chance to do that in the rest of the world . '' 
Others believe that Wolfowitz , seen as the intellectual force among the administration 's neo-conservatives , was always an uneasy fit at the Pentagon . 
`` When he was named deputy of secretary of defense I thought of a number of positions where he would be even more in tune with what was going on , '' says Thomas Keaney , a defense expert who worked with Wolfowitz during one of his brief spells out of government at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University . 
`` I thought he was even more in tune with international development and globalisation . 
This is a good fit . '' 
It is also a welcome escape for Wolfowitz , who has spent much of the past two years trying to defend his policies to Congress . 
The academic high priest of the Vulcans , as the president 's coterie of security advisers called themselves , Wolfowitz is associated inextricably with the greatest disasters of the Iraq war : the rosy predictions on the eve of the conflict that US soldiers would be welcomed with open arms as liberators , and his insistence that reconstruction could be financed from Iraqi oil revenues . 
`` I think he and the Bush White House have slightly different agendas . 
The Bush White House wanted to promote and reward a guy without going through - though they would never say this - a bruising confirmation battle for some other US government job , '' says James Mann , the author of a history of the Bush war cabinet called Rise of the Vulcans . 
`` He sees it as a chance to launch into an entirely new area , and to get away from being stuck on defense and military issues . '' 
Now 61 , Wolfowitz was born into a Polish Jewish immigrant family , and grew up mainly in the university town of Ithaca , New York , where his father was a professor of statistical theory at Cornell University . 
At 14 he spent a year in Israel while his father was a visiting professor in Haifa , and his sister emigrated to the country . 
But he is one of the few neo-conservatives in the Bush administration to endorse the creation of a Palestinian state , and was heckled at a pro-Israeli rally in 2002 for acknowledging Palestinian suffering . 
To please his father , the younger Wolfowitz enrolled at Cornell , too , where he studied maths and was offered a full scholarship , but went on to pursue his own interests in political science , doing graduate studies at the University of Chicago . 
There he encountered such leading conservative figures as Leo Strauss and Albert Wohlstetter , under whom he wrote his doctorate on the dangers of a nuclearised Middle East . 
Significantly for a neo-conservative , that included the threat posed by a nuclear-armed Israel . 
Since coming to Washington to work as an intern in the arms control and disarmament agency in 1973 , Wolfowitz has worked almost exclusively in government , apart from a period of exile during the Clinton years , when he headed the School of Advanced International Studies . 
Even colleagues who disagree violently with his view of the world concede that Wolfowitz was far more congenial than the usual Washington apparatchik . 
`` He does n't do what I have often seen in Washington which is treat you like a piece of furniture , '' says Dan Gour , a fellow at the Lexington Institute , who met Wolfowitz 30 years ago when he gave him a job at the arms control agency . 
`` Even if he was critical of something you had done for him , it was not done in a way that would diminish you as an individual . '' 
But despite sharp intelligence , willingness to put in 18-hour work days , and a genial , low-key manner , Wolfowitz has never before held a leadership position . 
Instead , he became `` the most influential underling in Washington '' , as Mann writes in his book . 
Over the years he worked under six presidents , including the Democrat , Jimmy Carter . 
But Wolfowitz 's preoccupations have not radically changed since his days as a graduate student : a belief in the importance of military power and that America is a force for good in the world , a distrust of the Soviet Union and of America 's intelligence agencies , and a disdain for the Kissinger doctrines of detente and containment . 
Since 2001 Wolfowitz has added another pillar to his ideology : a belief that the September 11 terror attacks changed the world forever . 
Clues to the way in which Wolfowitz would respond to that change as deputy Pentagon chief were evident from his first days in Washington . 
As a junior official at the Pentagon in 1977 he presided over a project which looked at the possibility of a Soviet seizure of Gulf oilfields . 
He also explored the consequences of an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia or Kuwait . 
To Mann , that was typical . 
`` He stands out for me from many other neo-conservatives for the frequency with which he takes core beliefs and then asks the next question , '' he says . 
During the 80s , Wolfowitz 's interests shifted from the Middle East to Asia , when he moved to the state department as assistant secretary for east Asia , then ambassador to Indonesia . 
Supporters say those years convinced him of the importance of using American might to promote democratic change . 
He was , by all accounts , a successful ambassador . 
But some who acknowledge his popularity also discount the argument that Wolfowitz used his influence as an envoy to press for change . 
`` It is really too much to claim that he played any kind of role in leading Indonesia to democracy , '' says Jeffrey Winters , an expert on Indonesia at Chicago 's Northwestern University , who was in the country at the time . 
`` The real record when you dig into it is that he was very slow to respond to Indonesia 's movement for democracy . 
Indonesia 's citizens across the spectrum had been struggling against authoritarian rule . 
They had been tortured . 
They had been jailed . 
They had been ruined in various ways , and the Wolfowitz embassy did n't speak up for them - not once . '' 
He adds : `` He had his chance , and he toed the Reagan hawkish line . '' 
The World Bank will be watching for far more than that from Wolfowitz .

2005-04-02,"No home fit for heroes Around 130,000 veterans of the Iraqi conflict have already returned to the US . 
For some , all that awaits is a life of virtual destitution . 
So far , the numbers are small , but the fear is that they are just the start of a chronic problem that America will be dealing with for years to come . 
Gary Younge reports Like Martin Luther King , Herold Noel had a dream that was `` deeply rooted in the American dream '' . 
It did not involve anything as lofty as racial harmony or the brotherhood of man . 
Herold was after something far more basic . 
`` I wanted to have a white house with a picket fence , without drugs and all that , '' he says . 
`` That was my dream . 
I grew up in the ghetto , and in the ghetto you will see a 10-year-old smoking weed . 
That 's what I was raised around , and I wanted a better life for me and my kids . 
I did n't want to be like Puffy and pour $ 1,000 bottles of Cristal on the floor . 
I just wanted to throw a barbecue in my own backyard . '' 
So Herold joined the army . 
`` The army offered me a better life , '' he says . 
It was his passport out of the ghetto . 
He signed up in September 2000 , `` to check it out '' . 
`` I did n't really expect to be in a war before I joined , but when Bush came to office , I knew there would be one . '' 
Sure enough , in January 2003 , Herold went to the Middle East and eventually to Iraq , where he worked as a fuel handler . 
He did n't think much of the politics involved in his mission . 
`` I let the politicians handle that . '' 
To the extent that he did think about it , his views did not go beyond basic revenge for the terrorist attacks of September 11 . 
`` My views were , we 're fighting for our country , because they 're bombing our country . 
We 're going to go and fuck these guys up , because they fucked up our country . 
I was fighting for our freedom . '' 
But in August 2003 , Herold returned to the US to find the personal dream he had been struggling for more elusive than ever . 
Herold had gone abroad to fight for his country and came back to find he was homeless . 
First he went to shelters , but he had his war medals stolen and felt harassed . 
By the middle of January , the 25-year-old father of four found a place to sleep not behind a white picket fence but in the back of his red 1994 Jeep Cherokee . 
He had sent three of his children to live with their grandmother in Florida . 
Meanwhile , his wife and toddler son were poised to join him in the car . 
The sister-in-law with whom they had been staying was about to move to a smaller apartment . 
`` Now I 'm fighting a different kind of war , but it 's still a war for survival , '' Herold says . 
Two years into the war in Iraq , and a growing number of isolated cases such as Herold 's have emerged of US veterans from the war on terror returning home to a life of virtual destitution . 
So far , the numbers are small . 
A couple of dozen unemployed veterans enrolling in a job-training program at a New England shelter for homeless veterans ; three men seeking help in Ohio ; a handful showing up in a survey in Minnesota ; 30 looking for assistance at the Black Veterans for Social Justice Centre in Brooklyn . 
According to the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans , the total is 67 nationwide . 
That figure amounts to a small fraction of the 130,000 who have already served and come home . 
And yet those who work with homeless veterans already see this as a terrible sign . 
`` We fear that we are going to see this big wave , '' says Linda Boone , director of the National Coalition For Homeless Veterans . 
`` It 's too early for that yet , but it could happen . 
People have these yellow ribbons saying Support The Troops . 
They support them when they 're in the war , but it 's when they take off the uniform that things get bad . '' 
Nicole Goodwin , 24 , found herself shuttling her one-year-old daughter Shylah between New York 's homeless shelters last year after she returned from Iraq . 
`` I thought my story was one in a million , '' she says . 
`` But it 's not . 
There are around 40 in New York alone ; we 're pushing for a congressional hearing . '' 
Dan Louhous , director of Special Projects Veterans Affairs at Ohio Valley Goodwill , says the worst is yet to come . 
`` It has n't been dramatic up to this point , because it 's just beginning . 
We have n't learned a damned thing since Vietnam . '' 
`` A true war story is never moral , '' wrote Tim O'Brien in The Things They Carried , his book about Vietnam . 
`` If at the end of a war story you feel uplifted , or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste , then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie ... You can tell a true war story by the way it never seems to end . 
Not then , not ever . '' 
Herold describes his experience in Iraq as `` a living hell '' that shows little sign of ending . 
`` We saw dead bodies everywhere . 
People walked over dead bodies like they were n't there . 
Women and children played with AK-47s . 
When you see a crowd in Iraq , you know that something bad 's going to happen when the sun goes down . '' 
More than once , something bad nearly did happen to Herold . 
One time , he was filling a fuel tank when he came under fire . 
The tank fell on its side . 
It would have taken one good shot to pierce the tank and blow him up . 
`` I could n't see anything . 
One of the other soldiers broke my window and got me out of there . 
I thought I was n't going to see my kids or nothing . 
I went through all that . 
I got religious over there . 
I thought somebody 's got to be looking out for me . '' 
Now Herold finds riding the subway difficult because he ca n't be around a lot of people . 
`` I was a happy-go-lucky person . 
Now I 'm angry and agitated . 
I get angry quick . 
I have bad dreams . 
I started hearing kids crying . 
I hear a lot of screaming , like there 's a riot going on . '' 
Vietnam hangs heavy on the American psyche . 
It is the moral weight against which any military adventure is measured : a flexible fable used as often by those who support war as by those who oppose it . 
Military veterans comprise 9 % of the overall population and 23 % of the homeless . 
Most of those are from the Vietnam era , but on average they did not become homeless until they had been back home from Vietnam for between nine and 12 years . 
That was how long it often took for the mental health problems to take their toll in the loss of family , job and home . 
It is also why providers of services believe the early trickle of homeless veterans from the Iraq war could presage something far more dramatic . 
The legacy of Vietnam shapes the public response to troops and veterans . 
Conscious that conscripted soldiers paid the price for a political mistake 35 years ago , Americans hold the troops sacrosanct - and this regardless of their politics . 
The nation is split over the war in Iraq , but the metallic yellow ribbons saying Support The Troops give no indication of whether a person is for or against the war . 
When Herold and Nicole 's stories became public last year , the response was breathtaking . 
New York Times readers offered Nicole rooms in their homes , baby supplies and pledges of more than $ 17,000 . 
A woman in California sent a cheque for $ 10 , to be used for `` a better life '' ; an anonymous donor sent a cheque for $ 1,000 , with a note that said , `` You risked your life in Iraq for your country ... for all of us . '' 
Nicole was also offered a $ 12-an-hour job by a community housing company , which she took so that she could rent a one-room apartment in Harlem from the Coalition for the Homeless . 
When Herold explained his situation on the radio , a caller offered him a job - he declined , saying that campaigning for veterans ' housing is his job . 
A couple of weeks later , Herold was given $ 18,500 and an apartment in the Bronx big enough to reunite his family . 
So long as the homeless veterans are few , such kindness from strangers is possible . 
But a recent study published by the New England Journal of Medicine found that 15 % -17 % of veterans from Iraq meet `` the screening criteria for major depression , generalised anxiety or PTSD '' . 
Of those , just 23 % -40 % are looking for help . 
Add mental illness to poor education and poverty , and many returning vets find themselves , like most of America 's working poor , just one routine mishap away from destitution - medical bills for an unexpected illness , an inescapable repair to a house or harsh weather blocking your way to work . 
In Herold 's case , he was living in Georgia waiting to re-enlist in the army when his car engine blew up . 
Living in a place where you needed a car to get around , Herold had a tough choice : `` It cost $ 2,500 to mend it , and I did n't have no $ 2,500 . 
So it was either pay rent or get the car fixed . 
I had to pay the rent , but then we both lost our jobs because we did n't have a car . 
That 's how come I came to New York with no job and no home . '' 
Like Herold , Nicole has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder . 
Like Herold , she has yet to receive any state benefits . 
Nicole , who went to the same high school as former secretary of state Colin Powell , became homeless last year after she fell out with her mother . 
Given the living conditions , it was not surprising . 
She came back from Iraq to a two-bedroom flat in the projects that served as home to her mother , her two sisters , a four-year old nephew , Nicole and her daughter Shylah . 
It took a week for the situation to deteriorate to the point where she and her mother could not share the same roof . 
`` It was n't any one thing , '' she says . 
`` Just the same old same old . '' 
After a spell in shelters , she now has a place in Harlem . 
When I arrived , Nicole apologised for the mess . 
A smart young woman with plans to go to university and study political science and journalism , Nicole 's outlook on life is generally upbeat . 
`` They throw you a lot of lemons and you have to make lemonade , '' she says . 
But since her return , she 's had trouble sleeping and is struggling to cope . 
Sometimes she feels numb . 
Walking down the street with Shylah recently , she almost got hit by a car . 
`` I felt nothing , '' she says . 
`` The only thought in my head was that people die every day . 
In Iraq , there were so many situations that you could n't help that I just got used to feeling that way . 
The worst thing was n't the war , it was coming back , because nobody understood why I was the way I was . '' 
The government body that is supposed to deal with these issues is the Veterans ' Association . 
But the VA is hopelessly overstretched , capable of helping just 100,000 of the 500,000 homeless veterans each year . 
And they can hope for little improvement . 
Recently the Bush administration offered generous benefits to those who died in battle , including an increase from $ 12,420 to $ 100,000 to the families of fallen soldiers , plus an extra $ 150,000 in life insurance . 
But for the living there were cuts in the number of nursing care beds and plans to charge wealthier veterans with non-service related problems an annual fee and double their prescription payments . 
`` Congress has gone too far in expanding military retiree benefits , '' David Chu , a defense under - secretary , told the Wall Street Journal in February . 
He went on to say the growth in veterans ' benefits was `` starting to crowd out two things : first , our ability to reward the person who is bearing the burden right now in Iraq or Afghanistan ... -LRB- second -RRB- we are undercutting our ability to finance the new gear that is going to make that military person successful , five , 10 , 15 years from now . '' 
It 's an analysis that conflicts with the way Americans like to think about themselves . 
America 's Promise is a standard history textbook , used by many of the nation 's high-school students , which tells the story of the country from the ice age to the present day . 
At the end of 690 pages detailing , among other things , the genocide of the native Americans , slavery , segregation , Vietnam , Watergate , the final paragraph reads : `` The history of the United States is one of challenges faced , problems resolved and crises overcome . 
Throughout their history Americans have remained an optimistic people , carrying this optimism into the new century . 
The full promise of America has yet to be realized . 
This is the real promise of America ; the ability to dream of a better world to come . '' 
It is difficult to overstress just how deeply ingrained this belief goes . 
The US is the only country in the world where -LRB- apart from a few years in the mid-1970s -RRB- people consistently believe that the next year will be better than the current one . 
To many US citizens , America is synonymous with `` freedom '' , `` democracy '' and `` opportunity '' . 
These are the ideals that many believe the nation is exporting to the Middle East in the present war ; they are also the ideals that many believe they are defending at home . 
Nicole and Herold were no different . 
As they talk about why they went to war and what they think of it now , they will waver between nationalistic pride and disappointment . 
Pride in what they believe America should be ; disappointment in what it has actually been for them . 
Both volunteered for the army for their own particular reasons , but they were , in essence , conscripted by poverty . 
`` I did it to get away from all the negativity in my life , '' says Nicole . 
`` I did n't think I was going to get involved in a war . 
I did n't have a sense of direction and I thought the army would give me that . '' 
Nicole is part of a trend that has seen a huge increase in minority women serving in the US army in noncombat roles . 
Black women , who comprise only 16 % of the civilian population , now outnumber white in the army . 
`` A survey of the American military 's endlessly compiled and analyzed demographics paints a picture of a fighting force that is anything but a cross-section of America , '' wrote the New York Times last year . 
`` With minorities over-represented and the wealthy and the underclass essentially absent . '' 
Both Herold and Nicole say they could not dwell on the rights or wrongs of this particular war . 
They were soldiers and this was their job . 
But events over the past few years have forced them to rethink . 
`` There 's not a day goes by that I do n't ask myself what was I fighting for , '' says Nicole . 
`` There were no WMD . 
We were lied to , and it hurts me to think I went there for somebody 's lie . '' 
Herold thinks the war was primarily about money . 
`` I thought I was fighting for a better world , '' he says . 
`` I thought I was fighting so my kids and maybe their kids could go to Iraq on vacation if they wanted to . 
But if you 're fighting this war for your own personal gain , that 's another thing . 
If you 're fighting for world peace , then I agree with it . 
It looks like we 're fighting for somebody else 's pocket . 
So that Halliburton can get rich . '' 
Yet neither the meager opportunities that forced them to join the army nor the dire conditions of their return can undermine their investment in the very American dream that progress and individual success are , if not inevitable , then universally possible . 
`` I saw Jay-Z -LRB- the rap star -RRB- going to these beautiful places , and I believe that if Jay-Z could come out of the ghetto , then I could come out of the ghetto , '' says Herold . 
`` The ideals of this country are that anybody could come back to America and make a better life for yourself . 
It 's a land of opportunity . 
In this country alone , if you put forth the effort , you can bear fruit . '' 
Squaring these mantras with their material conditions , however , is becoming increasingly difficult . 
They are caught between a need to believe in America 's Promise and the realisation that in some way it has failed to deliver . 
Abandoned by institutional indifference , but rescued by individual generosity , they remain intensely patriotic , though their understanding of what that means has shifted subtly . 
`` I was fighting for freedom for the Iraqi people , '' says Herold , '' but I never had that decent life myself . '' 
`` I think it 's ironic that I could go and fight for freedom abroad and can not find this kind of freedom in my own city , '' says Nicole . 
`` What America thinks of as freedom and what I think of as freedom are two different things . 
I want to get a house , day care and go to school . 
My freedoms are small . 
But I ca n't give up , '' she adds . 
`` That 's what I learned when I was getting shot at - if millions of Iraqis could n't stop me , my own country 's not going to stop me . ''

2005-04-03,"A history in the life of Karol Wojtyla 1920 : The Bolsheviks win civil war in Russia ; League of Nations is established 1931 : Gandhi leads Salt March in India 1939 : Germany invades Poland , Second World War begins 1946 : Winston Churchill makes ` Iron Curtain ' speech 1949 : Israel admitted to the new United Nations Karol Jozef Wojtyla , the second son of a retired army officer and tailor , and a schoolteacher , was born in Wadowice , a town of 8,000 Catholics and 2,000 Jews 35 miles south west of Krakow , in 1920 . 
Europe was still reeling from the First World War and the cataclysmic changes that the conflict had wrought . 
Poland was at war with a Russia that was racked by civil war . 
The forces that were to plague the twentieth century - chaos , totalitarian mass politics , ideology , racial hatred , violence - were in full cry . 
As a schoolboy , Wojtyla was largely oblivious to the tensions around him . 
In 1938 , he and his father moved to Krakow where he studied literature and philosophy . 
It was a time of cultural ferment as modernist art broadened from merely being the preserve of the avant garde and Wojtyla joined an experimental theater group . 
But no young Pole could remain oblivious to outside events . 
Over the next six years , Poland would suffer more than most nations from the mass ideologies gripping millions in Europe . 
Wojtyla escaped deportation and imprisonment by the German invaders by taking a job as a stone cutter in a quarry . 
In late 1942 , he began studying at an underground seminary in Krakow . 
Around him all was chaos . 
When the Germans began rounding up Polish men , Wojtyla fled to the archbishop of Krakow 's residence , where he remained until the end of the war . 
The future Pope was ordained in 1946 and the experience of war would mark him deeply . 
Both fascism and communism seemed products of the modern industrialised world , a world stripped of tradition , faith and the mystery of the church . 
Post-war , the Iron Curtain descended on Europe . 
To Wojtyla neither American-style capitalism nor communism could answer to the existential questions posed by the events of the previous decade . 
Only religion could preserve the world from a repeat of the nightmare of the Forties . 
The questions were about strategy , not conviction . 
In 1962 , the year Vatican Council II began the debates that would spark widespread reform of the church , Wojtyla was named Bishop of Krakow . 
He was an enthusiast for the changes , made an important intellectual contribution to the debate and , with his firsthand experience of repression in his native land , took special interest in religious freedom . 
The task he would pursue throughout his life , reconciling modernity with tradition , preserving the core message of the church without letting it become out of touch in a new , increasingly globalised world was taking shape . 
His appointment as cardinal in 1967 was welcomed by the communist Polish government who saw him as a useful moderate . 
He continued quiet , subtly subversive activities such as ordaining priests to work underground in Czechoslovakia , without angering the authorities . 
1985 : Mikhail Gorbachev calls for Glasnost and Perestroika , Ethiopian Famine On 16 October 1978 Wojtyla was elected the first non-Italian Pope since Adrian VI , a Dutchman , in 1523 . 
He took the name of his predecessor , John Paul , to symbolise his desire to consolidate the innovation of Pope John XXIII , who had presided over the Second Vatican Council , and the caution of Pope Paul VI . 
The years of physical and spiritual survival in testing circumstances had shown him the value of conservatism , yet his intellectual curiosity and his understanding of the huge resources now offered the church by modern communications , technology and travel convinced him that the church could not stand still . 
From the start the Pope was almost frenzied . 
In his first year as pontiff , he visited Mexico , Poland , the US and Ireland . 
In Poland , he received an ecstatic welcome from huge crowds , giving a massive boost to the trade union , Solidarity . 
His appointment came at a critical time . 
With the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union and the election of Ronald Reagan in the US . 
the Cold War suddenly got much colder . 
Though lauded as a modernist because of his informal style and his willingness to intervene to influence current affairs , his conservatism was often evident too . 
In 1985 the Vatican declared that homosexuality was an ` intrinsic moral evil ' and must be seen as an ` objective disorder ' . 
In 1988 the Pope ruled out women becoming priests . 
His aim was to preserve the Catholic church by making it fitter for the modern world , not to change the church itself . 
And when in 1989 nearly 300 theologians signed The Cologne Declaration criticising the Vatican for its authoritarianism , Rome imposed an oath of obedience on anyone in authority in the church to the teachings laid down by the Pope and the college of bishops . 
1989 : The means of transmitting Aids is discovered , Berlin Wall falls . 
In his last years , the Pope again showed his extraordinary capacity to respond to world events . 
Shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall , he held a historic meeting with the Soviet President , Mikhail Gorbachev , in the Vatican . 
In 1998 he made an astonishing trip to Cuba - continuing his lifelong work of subverting Communism in particular and totalitarianism in general - after which Fidel Castro agreed to allow Catholics to celebrate Christmas . 
He visited Jerusalem and made an unprecedented apology for the role the Catholic church had played in the persecution of the Jews , became the first Pope to enter a mosque , reached out to Orthodox Christians on trips to Greece and Armenia , and even publicly rebuked President Bush over the invasion of Iraq . 
Yet , though resolutely modern in style , the Pope continued to remain largely conservative in substance . 
His Veritatis Splendor encyclical claims there is a ` culture of death ' in which abortion , in-vitro fertilisation and embryology have become widely accepted . 
He condemned birth control as an ` intrinsic evil ' and condemned gay marriage .

2005-04-03,"` Crazy ' Iraqi spy was full of misinformation , says report Sunday 3 April 2005 02.26 BST An alcoholic cousin of an aide to Ahmed Chalabi has emerged as the key source in the US rationale for going to war in Iraq . 
According to a US presidential commission looking into pre-war intelligence failures , the basis for pivotal intelligence on Iraq 's alleged biological weapons programs and fleet of mobile labs was a spy described as ` crazy ' by his intelligence handlers and a ` congenital liar ' by his friends . 
The defector , given the code-name Curveball by the CIA , has emerged as the central figure in the corruption of US intelligence estimates on Iraq . 
Despite considerable doubts over Curveball 's credibility , his claims were included in the administration 's case for war without caveat . 
According to the report , the failure of US spy agencies to scrutinise his claims are the ` primary reason ' that they ` fundamentally misjudged the status of Iraq 's -LRB- biological weapons -RRB- programs ' . 
The catalogue of failures and the gullibility of US intelligence make for darkly comic reading , even by the standards of failure detailed in previous investigations . 
Of all the disproven pre-war weapons claims , from aluminium centrifuge tubes to yellow cake uranium from Niger , none points to greater levels of incompetence than those found within the misadventures of Curveball . 
The Americans never had direct access to Curveball - he was controlled by the German intelligence services who passed his reports on to the Defense Intelligence Agency , the Pentagon 's spy agency . 
Between January 2000 and September 2001 , Curveball offered 100 reports , among them the claims of mobile biological weapons labs that were central in the US evidence of an illicit weapons program , but subsequently turned out to be trucks equipped with machinery to make helium for weather balloons . 
The commission concluded that Curveball 's information was worse than none at all . 
` Worse than having no human sources , ' it said , ` is being seduced by a human source who is telling lies . ' 
Although the defector has never been formally identified , it appears he was an Iraqi chemical engineer who defected after UN inspectors left the country in 1998 . 
In the aftermath of the US-led invasion , Iraqis whom Curveball claimed were co-workers in Saddam 's alleged biological weapons program did not know who he was . 
He claimed he 'd witnessed a deadly biological weapons accident when he was not even in Iraq when it was meant to have happened . 
After September 2001 , his claims were given greater credibility despite the fact that he was not in Iraq at the time he claimed to have taken part in illicit weapons work . 
His information was central to an October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate that concluded Iraq ` has ' biological weapons , and was widely used by President Bush and Dick Cheney to make their case for war . 
It now appears there were problems with Curveball from the start , but the intelligence community was willing to believe him ` because the tales he told were consistent with what they already believed . ' 
In May 2000 doubts about his credibility surfaced when he was examined for signs that he had been exposed to biological agents . 
While the results were inconclusive , a US official was surprised to find Curveball had a hangover and said he ` might be an alcoholic . ' 
By early 2001 , the Germans were having doubts of their own , telling the CIA their spy was ` out of control ' . 
But warnings were dismissed . 
Intelligence analysts who voiced concern were ` forced to leave ' the unit mainly responsible for analyzing his claims , the commission found . 
At every turn analysts were blocked by spy chiefs and their warning never passed on to policy-makers . 
The commission 's report is unlikely to renew confidence in America 's intelligence network as it attempts to uncover evidence of WMDs in Iran and elsewhere . 
The report concludes that US intelligence agencies remain poorly coordinated , have resisted reform and produce ` irrelevant ' work . 
Dozens of insurgents attacked Abu Ghraib prison outside Baghdad yesterday , detonating two suicide car bombs and firing rocket-propelled grenades at US forces before the assault was repelled . 
At least 20 US soldiers and 12 detainees were wounded in the fighting , which lasted around an hour .

2005-04-03,"Fury at ` shoot for fun ' memo Outburst by US security firm in Iraq is attacked by human rights groups Sunday 3 April 2005 02.26 BST One of the biggest private security firms in Iraq has created outrage after a memo to staff claimed it is ` fun ' to shoot people . 
Emails seen by The Observer reveal that employees of Blackwater Security were recently sent a message stating that ` actually it is `` fun '' to shoot some people . ' 
Dated 7 March and bearing the name of Blackwater 's president , Gary Jackson , the electronic newsletter adds that terrorists ` need to get creamed , and it 's fun , meaning satisfying , to do the shooting of such folk . ' 
Human rights groups said yesterday that the comments raised fresh questions over the role of civilian contractors operating in Iraq and other world flashpoints . 
` We are very concerned about the increased use of security companies , there needs to be more inspection and regulation of these companies , ' said a spokesman for Amnesty International . 
Blackwater has already been the subject of lobbying efforts to introduce tighter regulations on private military operations in Iraq . 
It is one of the fastest growing private security firms in the world , and achieved global prominence last year when four of its men were ambushed by a crowd of Iraqis and their bodies mutilated and dragged around the Iraqi city of Falluja . 
The controversial wording of the Blackwater bulletin appears to be an attempt to criticise the ` righteous outcry ' that followed a recent statement from a senior US Marine general who , on returning home from Iraq , claimed it was ` fun to shoot some people ' . 
While the views of Lieutenant-General James Mattis drew a frosty response from the Pentagon , others said his observations reflected the harsh realities of war . 
Blackwater 's entry to the debate appears to suggest that satisfaction can be drawn from combat if ` the bad guys ' get what they deserve . 
` All of us who have ever waited through an hour and a half movie , or read some 300 pages of a thriller , to the point when the bad guys finally get their comeuppance know this perfectly well , ' says the opening address of the six-page bulletin , which The Observer believes to be authentic . 
Called Blackwater Tactical Weekly , the newsletter was sent to environmental activist Frank Hewetson as well as the firm 's staff . 
Last year Hewetson was offered a job by Blackwater with a salary of up to # 85,000 plus health benefits to work with its ` military crisis operations support team . ' 
Although he declined , Hewetson remains on the firm 's database . 
The 7 March bulletin also features a plug for Blackwater 's training academy which offers potential recruits an eight-week course that includes training in various firearms , close quarter protection , physical security as well as ` ground fighting . ' 
Among its various roles in post-war Iraq , Blackwater has guarded provincial outposts for the Iraqi coalition provisional authority and had the contract to keep former chief US envoy Paul Bremer alive . 
The company has been praised for its role in the rescue of a wounded soldier in Najaf . 
Defense experts have described Blackwater as a major player in the field of private arms with an important role to play in aiding American security in the war on terror . 
Other Blackwater emails seen by The Observer , from last year , indicate the large market for civilian contractors in war zones . 
` We will probably require at least 3000-4000 professionals above and beyond what we have in the Blackwater employment and resource system , ' states one . 
There are thought to be as many as 20,000 private enterprise soldiers in Iraq , with the US military an advocate of their use . 
This system allows governments to save money on paying permanent soldiers , and offers the political bonus that it is unlikely to attract as much media attention as conventional troops . 
The Observer made numerous attempts to contact Blackwater 's head office in North Carolina , but no calls were returned . 
There is , however , no evidence that company staff have ever shot people for fun . 
The firm is understood to have disciplined and well-trained recruits . 
A number are thought to be elite soldiers who have retired from military special-operations units . 
Blackwater also offers extensive psychological counselling programs to combat potentially traumatic battlefield stress .

2005-04-06,"The Iraqi president , Jalal Talabani . 
Photograph : Vahid Salemi\/AP The two-month political deadlock over the make-up of Iraq 's new leadership ended with the election of the Kurdish leader Jalal Talabani as president today . 
More than nine weeks after the January 30 elections , the Iraqi parliament voted in Mr Talabani - a veteran of the Kurds ' Saddam-era struggles for independence - and paved the way for a new government in Baghdad . 
A presidential council of Mr Talabani and his two deputies , the former president Ghazi Yawer , a Sunni Arab tribal leader , and the finance minister , Adel Abdul Mahdi - who is a Shia - will now appoint a prime minister to lead Iraq until the next set of elections take place in December . 
Their choice , to be announced within the next two weeks , is expected to be Ibrahim al-Jaafari , a conservative Islamist also from the majority Shia community . 
However , the election of Mr Talabani , Iraq 's first Kurdish president , reflects the largely pro-US minority 's clout in post-war Iraq . 
On paper , the Iraqi presidency is a largely ceremonial post , but the presence of 72-year-old Mr Talabani in Baghdad will prove influential . 
`` This is the new Iraq - an Iraq that elects a Kurd to be president and an Arab former president as his deputy , '' the parliamentary speaker , Hajem al-Hassani , said after the vote . 
`` What more could the world want from us ? '' 
Mr Talabani , who was hailed by a standing ovation in parliament , pledged to work with all ethnic and religious factions to rebuild Iraq after decades of conflict and dictatorship . 
For weeks , the Islamist-led Shia alliance that won a slim majority in parliament and the Kurdish coalition that came second in the polls have been arguing about forming a government . 
Kurdish parties were especially keen to counter Shia influence by including representatives of the Sunni Arab minority in a national unity government . 
Disagreement over which Sunni would be vice-president held up a deal , but political leaders decided late yesterday to favor Mr Yawar over elder statesman Adnan Pachachi . 
Frustration among Iraqis who braved suicide bombs and threats to vote grew as the wrangling went on . 
Some key decisions - such as who occupies the important oil and defense ministries - remain to be made . 
Many Iraqis complained that politicians had let them down by taking so long to form a government , fearing the delay could have benefited Iraq 's still active insurgency . 
A western diplomat in Baghdad told the Associated Press : `` The people are waiting for success , while the insurgents are waiting for failure . '' 
According to the interim law , Mr Jaafari will have two weeks to form a government , which must be approved by a two-thirds vote in parliament . 
Even if an administration can be named , the future of a Shia-Kurdish alliance looks shaky . 
The secular Kurds are seeking to distance their region from the central government . 
The Shia-led alliance is backed by the religious establishment in Najaf , and is dominated by Islamists , many of whom are centralisers . 
There have been suspicions that some secular-minded leaders were deliberately holding up progress to undermine Mr Jaafari . 
`` There is little common ground other than a shared past of resistance against Saddam Hussein , '' one western observer in Baghdad said . 
`` There does not seem to be any clarity about the future . ''

2005-04-06,"Wednesday 6 April 2005 12.47 BST It looks like a Naomi Klein book . 
It has her name emblazoned on the cover . 
In a tilt to her bestseller , No Logo , it 's called No War . 
The design is strikingly similar . 
The book 's synopsis on Amazon namechecks the activist writer in the first sentence . 
But , according to Klein , No War by Naomi Klein is not by her at all . 
It is an anthology of essays which , says Klein , `` contains one previously published magazine article by me that has been available free-of-charge on my website for eight months '' . 
Klein is adamant that `` No War is not my book ; I had no role in choosing the title , and will accept no revenue from its sales . 
`` I am very concerned that readers will mistakenly believe that they are purchasing original writing , despite my best efforts to convince the publisher to clearly label the book what it is : an anthology of previously published articles by multiple authors , '' she adds . 
So what 's going on ? 
The # 4.99 paperback is published by Gibson Square books , a publishing company founded in 2001 by Martin Rynja , the former commissioning editor of Duckworth 's . 
According to its website , Gibson Square `` specialises in books with either a strong biographical element , or those which are based in some relevant way on personal experience . 
They will , in addition , have a high publicity potential and be able to provoke or contribute to a current debate '' . 
Gibson Square Books is certainly no stranger to controversy . 
Last July the independent publisher picked up Craig Unger 's House of Bush , House of Saud after Random House pulled out of a deal amid fears it could be sued for libel . 
The book inspired some of the more sensational allegations contained in Michael Moore 's film Farenheit 9\/11 and Amazon . 
co. uk refused to stock the book although all the major bookchains and Amazon 's US site carried it . 
According to Martin Rynja , the confusion over No War has arisen because of a last minute change of format of the book . 
Gibson Square had originally intended to publish Klein 's article on its own . 
Rynja says that he read the piece and thought it was `` mind-blowing - it 's long but it 's punchy and casts a light on the Iraq war which I found completely compelling . 
It has the ` a-ha ! ' 
element - after you have read it , something you have always vaguely thought becomes crystal clear '' . 
He sought rights from Klein via her website and was sent a standard response email about the essay which said that the rights were controlled by Harper 's , the original publishers of the article . 
The magazine agreed to sub-licence the article . 
Rynja says that all was running smoothly until about three weeks before the publication date when he had two long conversations with Klein about the book . 
`` I heard that she is working on a new book on the subject and did n't want the essay published on its own , '' he says . 
`` She felt passionately that the book should be turned into an anthology with more authors included . 
We could have gone ahead and published the essay on its own , as planned , if we had wanted as we had the rights , but because she felt very strongly and I admire her as a great thinker and writer - in the calibre of Noam Chomsky or Hannah Arendt - I did what I could and we missed the original publication date in order to include three other extremely strong authors who develop the seam of the lead article further . '' 
The three other contributors are Susan Watkins , writing on the Iraq war as a front for US commercial , interests , Brian Miller on selling Iraq and Walter Lecoeur on terrorism . 
According to Rynja , the reason the other contributors are not mentioned on any of the online information about the book is because the revised data submitted to Neilson Bookdata and Amazon has not yet been updated and the sites are still displaying information referring to the original version of the Klein-only book . 
In response to Klein 's claim that the writing in the book is not `` original '' , Ryjna argues that many books are published first in the US and then in the UK , or carried from one medium to another and that the work itself stays original . 
`` There is a market for books in their physical form rather than in electronic form , '' he says , `` it 's simply bringing her very important message to different markets . '' 
However , the situation may be murkier than it first appears . 
While it is true that Harper 's had syndication rights on Klein 's essay , the author retained the book contract rights and the sale of them to Ryjna by Harper 's was a mistake - one about which Klein says she knew nothing until three weeks before the book was due to be published . 
At this point , having failed to persuade Ryjna to withdraw the book , Klein and her agent tried to salvage the situation as best they could , and avoid a protracted legal battle , by mooting the possibility of an anthology in which all the contributors would be equally credited . 
Again , however , Gibson Square have a different take on events : they reiterate that they did approach Klein , via her website , to ask for the rights to publish the essay in book form in the UK and were told to approach the magazine , from whom the rights were obtained . 
They then claim they went back to Klein in the first week of March to ask for corrections or additions , at which point the idea to include three other writers came up , and was agreed to . 
Politico 's , the specialist political online bookstore , is advertising No War as being `` by Naomi Klein '' on its website , and reports no complaints about it from customers but they have not yet sold a single copy of the book . 
`` I was not aware of Naomi Klein 's statement but I will look into it , '' said a spokesman for Politicos , `` If the book is being mis-sold we will take it off the site . '' 
Waterstone 's Economist 's Bookshop at the LSE said that they had sold three copies of the book , from a stock of about 25 , and had received no complaints from customers . 
The book is officially published on April 18 and , says Rynja , Gibson Square 's wholesalers have already sold nearly a thousand copies of the book . 
Meanwhile , Naomi Klein is encouraging readers interested in her essay , Baghdad Year Zero , to download it for free from her website , nologo.org .

2005-04-09,"A slow rebirth for Baghdad the beautiful Two years after US tanks rolled in , Iraq 's capital is part ruin , part building site . 
Now locals are trying to restore some color to their city It boasts alliteration but the concept seems fanciful : beautiful Baghdad . 
Iraq 's capital is famous for violence , degradation , occupation and blackouts , not aesthetic appeal . 
Everywhere there are concrete blast barriers , sandbags and razor wire . 
Rubbish lines streets which are sometimes ankle-deep in sewage . 
Bombed buildings remain in ruins . 
Giant mosques commissioned by Saddam Hussein lie unfinished on idle building sites . 
April 9 2003 was the day American troops took the city and toppled the dictator 's statue in Firdos square . 
Two years later debate over the war still rages , but one point Baghdadis agree on is that today marks the anniversary of when their city became an eyesore . 
`` The place looks awful , '' said Hussein Abd Emir , 52 , a cafe owner in Karrada , a district for the well-heeled . 
`` It 's like a military base . 
A dirty military base . 
My God , it 's ugly . '' 
But in big and small ways things are changing . 
City authorities and residents themselves are injecting color and vitality through initiatives designed to beautify Baghdad . 
Municipal workers have planted thousands of bushes and trees along thoroughfares and intersections . 
It is easy to miss them now but within six months some species will be waist-high foliage , said Mustafa al-Ubadi , 35 , pointing to freshly planted rows of leafless saplings opposite his fish restaurant on Abu Nawas street . 
Emboldened by better security and business , he plans to return paintings he stored at home for safety to the bare walls of his restaurant . 
This week trucks unloaded tonnes of soil on to the east bank of the Tigris , which is to be laid with grass , dotted with benches and linked to a new park due to open later this year . 
There will be a fountain , swings and slides , said Kadhim Radhi , 40 , a council worker at the site . 
This weekend the city will regain a favorite playground : Jadriya lake , formerly known as Saddam lake . 
Built on farmland a year before his fall , the 36-hectare -LRB- 90-acre -RRB- expanse of water with kiosks along its banks was popular with families and couples . 
But American tanks smashed the paving and when looters stole electric cables and pumps the lake drained into the Tigris , leaving the site dry and desolate . 
Six months ago the tourist board , part of the culture ministry , funded its restoration and the lake is back . 
Kiosks with pictures of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck have been painted in vivid blue , red and yellow . 
Speedboats were tested on the lake yesterday and musicians practiced for the opening ceremony . 
`` It 's like a lung for the city , '' said Abdul Razaq Ali , a supervisor . 
He looked forward to the return of foreigners . 
`` Give me security and I 'll give you tourists , '' he said . 
Hilal Shawkat , head of the Iraqi investment firm which restored the lake , said he would build restaurants and amusement parks around the shore . 
`` This will revive the nightlife of Baghdad , '' he said , carrying an armful of glossy company brochures for architectural plans . 
One of them , entitled Happy Land in Baghdad , included a 500-room , five-star hotel near the lake . 
`` Iraq will be back to normal in two years , '' said Mr Shawkat , ignoring a burst of gunfire and sirens in the distance . 
Ordinary Baghdadis are puncturing the drab greyness with flowers and potted plants which have become more visible in homes and shops , cheering the likes of Talab Hadi , 38 , a third-generation horticulturist . 
`` Business is 10 times better than six months ago , '' he beamed . 
`` People want color . '' 
But the city is far removed from its glorious heritage . 
Said by some historians to be the site of the Garden of Eden , it was founded in AD762 by Caliph Abu Ja ` far al-Mansour and became the heart of medieval Muslim civilisation , a political capital as well as an architectural wonder immortalised in stories such as the 1001 Nights . 
The Mongols , among others , razed it several times , but Baghdad recovered and 19th century visitors proclaimed it the most beautiful city in the east . 
In the 70s it began to deteriorate . 
Saddam Hussein erected brutalist apartment blocks and kitsch monuments , and uprooted trees from river banks lest they provide cover for assassins . 
War with Iran and the first Gulf war drained resources , while economic sanctions and an explosion in population , estimated at 5.6 million , crippled the infrastructure . 
US dollars gushed with the occupation , but they did little to alleviate banes such as the green zone , a heavily fortified swath of embassies and government buildings which burned a hole in the city 's heart , closing bridges and roads . 
In addition to concrete and razor wire , the security crisis necessitated a curfew which prevents night-time street cleaning , producing mounds of waste . 
Four children collecting litter yesterday were killed by a bomb hidden in the rubbish which was probably intended for US or Iraqi security forces . 
When Saddam fell the new-found freedom eroded civic mindedness because there was no authority to fear , said Adnan Omran , 57 , a municipal manager . 
Drivers would park their cars anywhere they liked and rubbish was dumped at random . 
Increased staffing and pay have given him the means to crack down on these nuisances , starting with shops which displayed wares on pavements . 
`` What about pedestrians ? '' 
said Mr Omran , indignant . 
Six months ago Bradt Travel Guides published what was probably the first postwar guidebook for Baghdad . 
If you do not enjoy Iraq 's capital , at least appreciate the residents , it said . 
`` They are a justifiably proud people , whose city was the capital of the world when London was an overgrown village and Columbus several centuries away from America . 
`` War has not destroyed this and western condescension is met with the scorn it deserves . '' 
"
2005-04-12,"Tuesday 12 April 2005 01.52 BST A report to the UN human rights commission in Geneva has concluded that Iraqi children were actually better off under Saddam Hussein than they are now . 
This , of course , comes as a bitter blow for all those of us who , like George Bush and Tony Blair , honestly believe that children thrive best when we drop bombs on them from a great height , destroy their cities and blow up hospitals , schools and power stations . 
It now appears that , far from improving the quality of life for Iraqi youngsters , the US-led military assault on Iraq has inexplicably doubled the number of children under five suffering from malnutrition . 
Under Saddam , about 4 % of children under five were going hungry , whereas by the end of last year almost 8 % were suffering . 
These results are even more disheartening for those of us in the Department of Making Things Better for Children in the Middle East By Military Force , since the previous attempts by Britain and America to improve the lot of Iraqi children also proved disappointing . 
For example , the policy of applying the most draconian sanctions in living memory totally failed to improve conditions . 
After they were imposed in 1990 , the number of children under five who died increased by a factor of six . 
By 1995 something like half a million Iraqi children were dead as a result of our efforts to help them . 
A year later , Madeleine Albright , then the US ambassador to the United Nations , tried to put a brave face on it . 
When a TV interviewer remarked that more children had died in Iraq through sanctions than were killed in Hiroshima , Mrs Albright famously replied : `` We think the price is worth it . '' 
But clearly George Bush did n't . 
So he hit on the idea of bombing them instead . 
And not just bombing , but capturing and torturing their fathers , humiliating their mothers , shooting at them from road blocks - but none of it seems to do any good . 
Iraqi children simply refuse to be better nourished , healthier and less inclined to die . 
It is truly baffling . 
And this is why we at the department are appealing to you - the general public - for ideas . 
If you can think of any other military techniques that we have so far failed to apply to the children of Iraq , please let us know as a matter of urgency . 
We assure you that , under our present leadership , there is no limit to the amount of money we are prepared to invest in a military solution to the problems of Iraqi children . 
In the UK there may now be 3.6 million children living below the poverty line , and 12.9 million in the US , with no prospect of either government finding any cash to change that . 
But surely this is a price worth paying , if it means that George Bush and Tony Blair can make any amount of money available for bombs , shells and bullets to improve the lives of Iraqi kids . 
You know it makes sense .

2005-04-13,"Wednesday 13 April 2005 01.03 BST The number of soldiers to desert the army or go absent without leave has more than doubled over the past year , the Ministry of Defense has revealed . 
There are now more than 500 soldiers whose whereabouts are unknown . 
The rise coincided with the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath . 
Independent sources said yesterday that the war was clearly a factor . 
However , the rising trend over four years suggests that other issues also played a part . 
The number of soldiers still illegally absent last year totalled 530 , compared with 205 in 2003 , 150 in 2002 , and 100 in 2001 . 
The figures show that soldiers went Awol more than 3,000 times last year , with only a third of that figure accounting for returns to base within 21 days . 
The largest number of soldiers going Awol came from the infantry , followed by the Royal Logistic Corps and the Royal Artillery , according to the MoD . 
The figures were released to Bob Russell , the Liberal Democrat MP for Colchester , a garrison town . 
Though he first asked for the information in January , the MoD did not respond until it was too late for him to pursue the matter . 
The response to his original question came more than two months later in a letter from the armed forces minister , Adam Ingram . 
`` The mere fact they took so long to answer the question is significant , '' Mr Russell said yesterday . 
He asked for the information after being told by a source that a growing number of soldiers disapproved of the government 's stand on Iraq . 
He still has not seen Mr Ingram 's letter , which was addressed to the Commons on the last full working day of parliament and gives no explanation for the rise . 
The MoD said yesterday that it was unable to comment . 
Gilbert Blades , a lawyer representing Awol soldiers , said Iraq was `` probably the biggest factor '' . 
But he said a growing number of young soldiers were also not prepared to `` suffer the indignities and discipline '' of army life . 
Justin Houston-Roberts , who also represents soldiers , said : `` There 's been a very noticeable increase of not only soldiers but airmen as well asking our advice on being absent without leave , '' he said . 
`` Some are subjected to horrific bullying and run away to save themselves ... There are huge amounts of reasons but the conflict in Iraq is significant . '' 
He added : `` When the conflict started we had a very noticeable increase in requests to assist soldiers who wanted to leave the services or had done so without permission . 
`` I think Iraq has had an impact . 
It 's not necessarily people who do n't want to fight but people who have found themselves in situations upon their return that they ca n't necessarily cope with . '' 
Mark McGhee , another solicitor , said : `` Certainly from my experience of dealing with soldiers returning from Iraq , I would be very concerned about the fact that there 's been a doubling up of the numbers going Awol . ''

2005-04-17,"` Everyone should know about it ' Are today 's young people as ignorant of history as we fear ? 
We asked Six London teenagers to tell us about the war ... Sixty years on from the end of war in Europe , how much do today 's teenagers actually know about the events surrounding the Second World War ? 
If popular opinion is to be believed , not a lot . 
We decided to put this assumption to the test by gathering together a panel of six London teenagers to discuss what they know about the war and what it means to them today . 
Our team are : Lebbie Larbi , 16 , Efe Olokpa , 17 , Marlin Khondoker , 17 and Jessie McGavin , 17 - who were all born and live in London . 
Bulgarian-born Iva Kazalova , 17 , moved to London with her family about 18 months ago and Enrique Grande , 17 , is from Madrid and is in the UK on a one-year exchange . 
Enrique 's passion is international politics , while Lebbie likes football , basketball and table tennis ; Efe and Iva are into reading , socialising and listening to music ; Jessie loves films and wants to travel ; and Marlin likes history and her cat , Peanut . 
What do you know about the Second World War ? 
Lebbie Larbi : Over 60 million people died . 
Efe Olokpa : Although the war ended in , like , Europe , there was still the war in the Far East , in the Pacific , with the US and Japan . 
Iva Kazalova : I know that over 6 million Jews died . 
Enrique Grande : Germany was blamed for the whole war , and Japan as well . 
Marlin Khondoker : Germany was upset about the Versailles Treaty and they retaliated after they were treated so badly . 
Jessie McGavin : VE Day was on 8 May . 
VJ Day , the victory against Japan , was later , in September . 
What countried were involved in the war and when did it begin ? 
Enrique : I think when Great Britain declared war on Germany was when the Germans invaded Poland in 1939 , was n't it ? 
Then basically the States and everyone joined the Allies and everything started . 
There were two main sides , there was the Allies , France , Great Britain , the States , and Russia . 
Then there was Germany and their partner . 
Efe : Well the USA did n't really join the war , but ... Efe : ... when Japan bombed them ... Marlin : They sort of supported from the sidelines , they gave money to help . 
Efe : Yeah , but they were n't really in it until Japan bombed Pearl Harbour . 
How do you find out about these events ? 
Efe : Well recently there was that thing on television about the Second World War in color . 
Marlin : Occasionally the teachers recommend watching something like the documentary on Auschwitz . 
Jessie : We touch on things about the war in other subjects too , like RE when we used to have general discussions . 
You pick up things that way . 
Was the war fought for a good cause and was Germany fighting for an evil one ? 
Lebbie : I think it was a good cause . 
If the Germans had won I would n't be here . 
The Germans wanted blond-haired , blue-eyed people , and I 'm not blond-haired and blue-eyed ! 
Jessie : I do n't know , I do n't think you can ever say it 's just the goodies and the baddies . 
I think you have to look deeper . 
On the whole , though , it was good that the war happened against Germany and that Germany did n't win . 
Enrique : They were suggesting that we should kill some races just because they thought they were superior to them . 
They were suggesting we should get rid of disabled people , mentally incapable people , things like that . 
I think it was a good cause to fight against them . 
I do n't think it was good that so many people died , but it 's better than having Hitler for 80 years . 
Do you think of the Iraq war in the same terms as the Second World War ? 
Jessie : The Iraq war does n't seem like a war to me at all . 
I think that it 's good that the Second World War happened and that the Germans did n't win . 
Whereas I do n't think the Iraq war should have gone ahead at all . 
Enrique : There were two sides in the Second World War and they were roughly equally powerful in everything . 
In the Iraq war you basically had the States and some other countries crushing these poor people with AK-47s , and they have really powerful guns and planes and everything so I do n't think it 's a war , it 's not fair , it 's not a fair fight . 
Efe : Is n't a war supposed to end and it has n't really ended ? 
They say it 's war and people are dying but there is n't really a reason why ... Iva : You can relate Iraq to the Second World War because it 's something so global , it makes you think ... It 's something that everyone should reflect on . 
It 's the same today , even though we should have learned from the Second World War , with all the extremists and the American invasion and everything ... Lebbie : I agree . 
We get a broader view of the war than other people who do n't know about the Second World War . 
What was life like after the war ? 
Jessie : I think it was still hard , I mean it did n't just end , and everyone was happy and there was plenty to eat . 
There was still rationing and they were still fighting . 
Even after VE Day . 
There was n't really a cut-off point . 
Enrique : Japan and the United States carried on fighting for quite a long time . 
They said officially the war was over , but there was still fighting . 
How do you think being invoved in the war affected the lives of the people living here ? 
Jessie : I think everyone had a member of their family who died or at least everyone knew someone who had died . 
It was very real with the Blitz in London . 
But even though it was really depressing , people were better off during the war . 
Everyone had a sort of aim and that was lost when the war ended . 
Marlin : Because the men were away fighting , everyone bonded together , people had to work together a lot more . 
The war brought more independence for women as well so there was more of a community then than there is now . 
Do you think people were n't totally aware of what was going on ? 
Iva : Everyone was stuck to their radios , it was a major thing , everyone fought in it . 
Obviously today everyone cares about the Iraq war , but it 's not like we 're really participating in it . 
We are definitely more informed with television and newspapers and the internet today . 
Marlin : I think we get both perspectives now . 
Before , if you were in Britain they would have shown Britain as the winning side and they would n't have shown anything bad that was going on in Germany , what they 'd inflicted , kind of thing . 
Before the war started they would 've been excited to be fighting for their country . 
Now , at the start of the Iraq war , we did all those protests and marches against it rather than for it . 
Jessie : There 's more confusion as to who 's the good side and who 's the bad side today . 
Enrique : Germany was doing something bad to Poland , that 's why all the countries felt they should help . 
But what was Iraq doing ? 
Why are the States at war there ? 
It was more clear-cut in the Second World War . 
Jessie : It 's easier to be against war today . 
How will you celebrate on 8 May and do you think you should celebrate ? 
Efe : Maybe in my own special way . 
I 'll read the newspaper that day . 
Iva : At the time it must have been such a relief to know the war was finally ending . 
Today I think we should pay some sort of tribute , I mean more like quiet reflection . 
I do n't think it 's something we should drink to . 
It should make you think about what 's going on in the world today . 
Jessie : The deaths of all those people is not something to celebrate . 
Marlin : It 's a celebration of peace is n't it . 
Like at the end of the war . 
Lebbie : It depends how you see it . 
It is a celebration of the end of a horrible war . 
That 's why people party and drink because it 's a celebration of life . 
Do you think the Second World War should be kept in people 's minds ? 
Lebbie : You ca n't force people to know about it , but if they choose to know about it there should be the resources available . 
Enrique : I disagree . 
Everyone should know a bit about it so we can avoid it happening again . 
If everyone knows what happened , if everyone knows what 's going on , we could avoid it in the future . 
Marlin : Our school does encourage us . 
They brought in a speaker once who was a survivor of Auschwitz . 
He talked to us in assembly . 
Iva : It will fade away . 
There are just fewer and fewer memories and less personal experience to be told . 
Enrique : We 're studying the Nazis in Germany and a lot of people do n't know what happened in Germany just before the war . 
We 've been to Berlin and basically people just blank it out . 
They act like it did n't happen , but our teacher gave a talk about her family in early Nazi Germany and it 's something we would n't get to know otherwise . 
It was shocking because it 's the sort of thing that textbooks do n't tell you and people in Germany would never tell you . 
I think that 's a good way of keeping history going and getting people to know about it because otherwise we would forget about it . 
I do n't think we should forget about what happened . 
"
2005-04-19,"Tuesday 19 April 2005 08.43 BST Marla Ruzicka , who has been killed by a car bomber near Baghdad airport , was an extraordinary , one-person American aid agency , who worked tirelessly to get compensation for victims of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
Though only 28 when she died , she was an unusual mixture of charm , ebullience , adventure-seeking and tireless dedication to helping ordinary people whose lives had been shattered . 
She lobbied journalists and diplomats with equal persistence , but loved nothing better than to sit with wretched families after the spotlight had moved on , record every detail of their stories , go out and campaign for official apologies and compensation - and then stay in touch to keep them informed . 
On the day she died , on Iraq 's most dangerous road , she had been out talking to bereaved families . 
Her driver\/translator , Faiz Al Salaam , who also died , worked with her for almost two years . 
An unemployed pilot when she hired him , he had started flying for Iraq Air again , and , as the father of a two-month-old daughter , wanted to give up the danger of his work with Marla . 
But she was due to leave Baghdad this week , and he stayed on out of loyalty . 
They were driving , by chance , near a convoy of foreign contractors ' vehicles , which were the bomber 's target . 
Dressed in a long black abbaya , the head-to-toe covering which most western women now wear in Baghdad as protection , Marla used an ordinary car . 
Looking like a teenager - and with her bubbly enthusiasm and girlish shriek of a laugh - she was not always taken seriously when she arrived in her first big war zone , Afghanistan , just after the Taliban were ousted in December 2001 . 
Unlike most aid workers , she cultivated journalists , and wanted to know where the next party was . 
But her commitment to getting help for the forgotten was ferocious . 
One of her first actions in Kabul was to help organise a visit by American women who had lost family members on 9\/11 . 
They wanted to meet Afghan families whose homes had been destroyed by American bombs . 
Marla campaigned relentlessly by telephone and email , as well as by personal lobbying , and persuaded US Senator Patrick Leahy to put an amendment into a foreign aid bill to give $ 2.5 m for Afghan victims . 
It was not described as compensation , since the US did not wish to take formal responsibility , but Marla visited families all over Afghanistan , drew up lists of names , and helped to ensure that the money was distributed to the right people . 
In Afghanistan , she was working for Global Exchange , a non-governmental organization based in San Francisco . 
After the Iraq war , she created her own charity , CIVIC -LRB- Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict -RRB- . 
One aim was to keep a running account of the number of civilian deaths , but it quickly became an effort to help individuals . 
In an essay sent to Human Rights Watch shortly before she died , Marla wrote : `` A number is important not only to quantify the cost of the war , but , to me , each number is also a story of someone whose hopes , dreams and potential will never be realized , and who left behind a family . '' 
She continued her lobbying and got $ 20m for victims in Iraq . 
She also developed contacts in the US military , trying to get them to describe otherwise unreported incidents , and take responsibility . 
In a typical entry from her journal , published on AlterNet on November 6 2003 , she reported : `` On October 24 , former teacher Mohammad Kadhum Mansoor , 59 , and his wife , Hamdia Radhi Kadhum , 45 , were traveling with their three daughters - Beraa , 21 , Fatima , 8 , and Ayat , 5 - when they were tragically run over by an American tank . 
`` A grenade was thrown at the tank , causing it to lose control and veer on to the highway , over the family 's small Volkswagen . 
Mohammad and Hamdia were killed instantly , orphaning the three girls in the back seat . 
The girls survived , but with broken and fractured bodies . 
We are not sure of Ayat 's fate ; her backbone is broken . 
`` CIVIC staff member Faiz Al Salaam monitors the girls ' condition each day . 
Nobody in the military or the US army has visited them , nor has anyone offered to help this very poor family . '' 
Born in the small town of Lakeport , California , Marla became politically active at the age of 15 , when she was suspended from high school for leading a protest against the first Gulf war . 
While at Long Island University , she traveled extensively , visiting Cuba , Guatemala , southern Africa and the West Bank . 
She was already working as a volunteer for Global Exchange . 
Despite her exuberant exterior , she was not always happy , and her activism was sometimes both an obsession and a therapy . 
For exercise in Baghdad , she regularly stormed up and down the pool at the al Hamra hotel , the headquarters of the newspapers which preferred not to have large , guarded villas . 
Last new year 's eve , she emailed friends : `` 2005 is going to rock for you all and me too ... I write to you from the Himalayan mountains , where I am on a seven-day trek . 
Wow , is my mind clear , and I have many goals for 2005 . 
After my trek , I 'll work on a campaign to protect Nepalese activists - there have been over 3,000 disappearances here - more than Colombia . 
Then I am off to Afghanistan to check on the families who lost loved ones in Operation Enduring Freedom . '' 
Marla had also been planning to spend more time fundraising in the US . 
She had an initial grant from George Soros 's Open Society Institute , but wanted to develop more sources . 
After the Iraq election in January , she decided to make another trip to Baghdad . 
Medea Benjamin , her original mentor at Global Exchange , tried to dissuade her because of the increased danger . 
`` I thought it would be better to wait for a while and see if the situation got better than to put her life at risk , '' she told the Los Angeles Times . 
`` She was determined to go because the people she worked with did n't have the luxury not to be at risk . ''

2005-04-19,"The man who would not die Ten months ago , a BBC journalist and Irish cameraman set off on a seemingly safe assignment in Saudi Arabia . 
The trip left the reporter fighting for his life and his colleague dead . 
Now , for the first time , Frank Gardner tells his extraordinary tale of survival . 
By James Meek In spite of all he has endured , Frank Gardner retains his BBC voice - clear , measured , concise , registering on my old tape recorder perfectly through the din of helicopters and passenger jets passing over the cafe where we meet . 
His wheelchair is pulled up to the table . 
He has put back a little of the weight he lost in hospital . 
It 's a glorious early spring day , in a pleasant spot , 10 months after he was shot , but on his face , almost all the time , apart from the occasional smile , is an expression of frowning concentration , such as you see on the face of TV reporters who are first on the scene of a terrible disaster . 
It is quite unaffected : Gardner is still reporting from inside himself , from the war which entered him last summer , scene of his grief at the death of his colleague Simon Cumbers , his anger towards the killers , and the physical destruction of his body , which goes on causing him pain - pain that ca n't be eased without punishing side effects . 
`` I just think it 's cowardice to shoot somebody who 's defenceless . 
That is n't brave , that 's not making a stand for your beliefs , that 's just cowardice . 
What kind of a battle is that ? 
It 's one thing for them to be taking on the police in a shootout , but taking on a couple of unarmed , defenceless journalists ? '' 
There were times when Gardner and Cumbers would feel nervous about where they were going , but June 6 2004 , in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , was n't one of them . 
The district of the Saudi capital they were visiting had , it is true , been the scene of a shootout between security forces and Islamist fundamentalist militants six months earlier - that was why the two BBC men were going , to film some general footage of the area - but they did n't feel they were taking a risk . 
This was n't Fallujah , or some Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan . 
This was neat , rich , outwardly modern , usually safe Riyadh . 
Gardner , the BBC 's security correspondent , a fluent Arab speaker at home in the Gulf , and Cumbers , an experienced cameraman , had waited for permission from the Saudi ministry of information before going . 
They even had a government minder with them , and a government driver in a government van . 
It was their last job , on the last day of their assignment to Saudi . 
Their flights to London were booked for the next day . 
In war zones , journalists on their final day tend to get jumpy but this was n't a war zone . 
The only anxiety left was over the story - had they got good material ? 
- blending with warm anticipation of going home . 
Gardner and Cumbers reached the area in the late afternoon . 
`` It looked a completely normal Gulf residential suburb ... peachy colored villas , bougainvillea coming down the walls , very average , a couple of kids playing in the street , nobody suspicious lurking in doorways and whispering or anything like that , '' says Gardner . 
They filmed for half an hour , and prepared to leave . 
Cumbers was taking his camera off its tripod . 
They might as well have been on the plane home already . 
Gardner registered a car parking a short distance away , but it did n't come to a halt with a screech of tires and brakes . 
The banal sound of car doors , the two nondescript young men strolling towards them in ordinary white Saudi tunics : at first Gardner assumed they were friends of the driver . 
Too late , as the men advanced , Gardner understood . 
One of them - a beardless , completely average young man , in Gardner 's description - took out a pistol . 
`` I shouted , in Arabic , stupidly : ` No , do n't do this ! ' 
as soon as I saw him pulling out the pistol , '' says Gardner . 
`` He was probably 30 metres from me and I took off at once - and I presume Simon ran at the same time . 
We ran in different directions . 
We had no time to make a plan . '' 
Gardner ran from the gunman , deeper into the district . 
He heard a shot and something stung his shoulder . 
A bullet had passed through him . 
There were more shots . 
He was hit in the leg , his leg bone was fractured , and he fell , on a patch of waste ground . 
`` The adrenalin was really pumping so initially the shooting did n't hurt . 
It felt like a massive thump . 
With each bullet that went in it was like being picked up by a giant hand and slammed on the ground . '' 
Still , these were not deadly wounds . 
He would have made a full recovery . 
But the militants were n't finished . 
A second vehicle drew up alongside him , a cargo van . 
Gardner found himself looking up into the side doorway of the van where three militants crouched , looking at him . 
One of them was pointing a pistol . 
`` I pleaded with them in Arabic not to shoot me , '' says Gardner . 
`` They had a very quick discussion among themselves . 
I could n't pick up what they were saying . 
Then they emptied the pistol into me at pretty much point-blank range . '' 
Four 9mm bullets smashed into Gardner 's spinal nerves , pelvis and abdomen . 
Gardner remembers the expression on the face of the man who shot him . 
`` It was a sneer . 
It was a sneer of contempt , of hatred . 
Maybe he saw in me President Bush , Tony Blair , Ariel Sharon , Donald Rumsfeld , all rolled into one . 
I do n't know . 
He did n't see me as a non-partisan reporter who 's simply just trying to report what 's going on . 
He saw me as the enemy . '' 
Gardner found himself lying on his front , amazed to be still alive and conscious . 
He closed his eyes and pretended to be dead . 
He heard the feet of one of the militants walking around him and prepared to die . 
`` I thought this is it , this is going to be the execution shot in the back of the head . '' 
He felt the gunman rooting in his back trouser pockets . 
In one , he found Cumbers ' radio mike . 
In the other he found a miniature Qur ` an of the kind Gardner often gave out as gifts . 
That discovery , Gardner believes , may have saved his life , by giving the killer pause for thought . 
The militants drove off , leaving him bleeding in the dust . 
Gardner rolled over and cried for help . 
His legs were paralysed . 
`` My cries were just a sort of animal pain ... it was almost beyond pain . 
I 'm amazed I did n't black out . 
Maybe some of the stomach acid had leaked , I do n't know . '' 
The locals who gathered at the scene astonished Gardner by their behavior . 
It was as if , by being shot , he had put himself in a world beyond them . 
`` They did n't help at all . 
To me this was extraordinary , they offered no reassurance , no glass of water , no blanket , no cushion , nothing . 
They were discussing the cartridge cases around . 
They were saying , ` Look , I think he 's been shot , has he been shot , yes , he has , look at the bullet cases there , ' as if I was just an exhibit in a museum . 
It was bizarre because I 've had so much hospitality in the Middle East , so much kindness . '' 
Instead of an ambulance , two police cars arrived . 
He was manhandled into the back of one of them and driven off , screaming in pain , to hospital . 
`` It took them a long time to get me out of the police car and on to a hospital trolley , there was pulling and pushing and arguing . 
I remember them wheeling me into the operating theater and me shouting for painkiller and somebody injected me - and then I was out and I did n't come back up for eight days . '' 
When he woke up , he saw his wife , Amanda . 
`` It was fantastic to sort of swim up the surface of consciousness and open my eyes and see her there and although I was pretty groggy I asked a number of questions . 
I said : ` What 's happened to Simon ? ' 
And she said : ` He did n't make it . ' '' 
Cumbers , Gardner found out later , ran at right angles to him . 
He managed to run for about a kilometre , carrying his heavy Betacam camera , but could n't find any cover . 
The militants shot him in the head . 
In his eight days of drug-induced unconsciousness , Gardner himself came close to death . 
The first team of surgeons was well-intentioned but inexperienced . 
While they tried to patch him up , bullet hole by bullet hole , his life was slipping away . 
Two things saved him . 
One was that the governor of Riyadh heard what had happened and dispatched an emergency team , with a mobile intensive-care unit , from one of the city 's best hospitals , the King Faisal . 
The other was that the team was led by a South African , Peter Bautz , who happened to specialise in gunshot wounds . 
Bautz 's team operated on Gardner for the next 40 hours as he went in and out of surgery . 
They operated on his stomach so many times - nine - that they did n't even close it up between operations , just kept it covered . 
`` My intestines were very shot up , they had to take out quite a lot of them , there was internal bleeding , there was pus , fecal matter in there , there were infections , I had acute lead poisoning from one of the bullets . 
Dr Bautz told me one bullet went in , out and in again , somehow . 
So I was in quite a state . '' 
This was the beginning of a medical ordeal that continues . 
The Saudis paid for Gardner 's air ambulance back to Britain . 
Months of operations and recovery followed at the Royal London - where , despite superb care from a constellation of specialists , Gardner endured weeks of fever and vomiting as the result of infection from a feeding tube - and the Chelsea and Westminster . 
Incredibly , his major organs - liver , kidney , lungs , liver , stomach , heart - are relatively undamaged , and he now digests his food . 
He has lost part of his colon and his intestines , but has been told that he can do without them . 
His shoulder and leg wounds have healed . 
Even his spine is largely intact . 
Yet none of this is much comfort to Gardner and his family , because he still can not walk , and will never fully recover the use of his legs . 
The militant 's bullets severely damaged the cascade of nerves connecting the spine with the legs . 
Some were cut , and they do n't grow back . 
Gardner has not experienced any of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress as a result of the horror he experienced . 
All his troubles now are related to being suddenly thrust into the ranks of Britain 's estimated 40,000 spinal cord injury sufferers . 
`` The most stressful thing is coping with being disabled . 
Spinal injury is a complete life changer , '' he says . 
`` There is life before the injury and life afterwards and in a way that has dwarfed the horror of what happened . '' 
After the attack , when he was lying in the dirt , says Gardner , `` I never reconciled myself to dying , no , absolutely not . 
I never , ever thought this is all too difficult , I 'll just give up and die . 
It was thoughts of my family that kept me going . 
I love my family so much I want to carry on being a father and a husband to them . '' 
Now the family - Gardner and his wife have two daughters , aged six and seven - are reunited , and it has been hard . 
`` My wife has just been an amazing support , she has been so understanding . 
She married an able-bodied person and she 's now got a disabled husband . 
That 's tough for her as well . 
Physically , I 've gone from being a runner who 's quite robust to being somebody who 's in a wheelchair and quite vulnerable , essentially . '' 
`` The younger one has taken it in her stride , I think she 's fine . 
The older one , it 's been quite tough for her . 
She was very shocked when it happened , she was wandering round the playground in a daze . 
She was asking , ` Why did n't they shoot daddy with a water pistol ? 
Why did it have to be bullets ? ' 
For a six year old , as she was last year , she should n't be having to ask questions like that , she should n't even know what a bullet is . 
`` They 're much better now that I 'm back home . 
I was away in hospital for seven or eight months . 
At least now I 'm able to read them their bedtime story every night . 
The tough thing is that I was very physical with them before . 
Particularly with the older one . 
I 'd take her rock climbing and teach her rollerblading and take them swimming every weekend ... I 'm getting stronger , but when I first came back from my operation in January I would eat a few morsels of food and then have to go and lie down feeling sick . 
So I 've not had the same energy and dynamism that I had before . 
But I 'm having to find new things to do with them , like chess . 
They both love chess . '' 
Gardner 's fascination with the Arab world , which took him around the Middle East as an investment banker and , since 1995 , as a BBC journalist , began when he was 16 . 
His mother took him to meet a friend , the late Wilfred Thesiger , the writer and explorer who had lived among the Arabs of the Empty Quarter in Arabia and the marshes of Iraq . 
Sitting in Thesiger 's little flat in Chelsea , drinking tea , the young Gardner was not put off by the veteran 's disgust with the modernisation of the oil-era Middle East . 
He was inspired by Thesiger 's pictures and stories from the older Arab milieux of the 1940s and 1950s , and resolved to become an Arabist . 
He read Arabic and Islamic studies at Exeter , but found the academic course tough going . 
It was only when the university sent him to Cairo for a year that he blossomed . 
He stopped going to classes , moved in with an Egyptian family in one of the city 's medieval slums , and acquired fluent Arabic . 
A few years later he spent time living with the Bedu in Jordan , in the desert near Aqaba . 
`` By day I would go out with the shepherds and we 'd wander for miles with the goats and sheep over the dunes , drinking goat 's milk , but then when it was Ramadan we had to fast , and I fasted with them , and at night there would be these huge feasts , tribes would come from all around ... it was a wonderful time . 
They would tell stories under the stars and somebody would play a rababo , a stringed instrument that makes a very mournful sound , and then somebody would recite traditional poetry . 
`` Since then I 've made many Arab friends , mostly Muslim , some Christian . 
I 've loved living in the Middle East . 
It has been good to us . 
I met my wife in the Gulf . 
Some of the nicest people I 've ever met were in Bahrain , Oman and Saudi Arabia . 
`` Would I go back to Saudi Arabia now ? 
I would n't put my family , my parents , through that , even if I wanted to . 
Also I would n't want to go back and be seeming to thumb my nose at al-Qaida and say ` Na-na-na-na-na , you did n't get me . ' 
I 'm sure they were n't deliberately targeting me because of the job I do . 
If they were , it 's an own goal , because they knocked out almost the only western broadcaster who bothers to explain what al-Qaida 's complaints are , what their motivation is , so taking me off the air for nearly a year would be a pretty stupid thing to do . '' 
Gardner has just gone back to his old job at the BBC - effectively , the Corporation 's `` war on terror '' correspondent . 
He remains a tough critic of the Iraq war , dismissing the popular US belief that there was a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida . 
But would what had happened to him influence his wider reporting ? 
By way of an answer , Gardner says he had found inspiration in Daniel Pearl , the Wall Street Journal reporter executed by Islamic radicals in 2002 . 
Before his death , he had used his knowledge of these terror groups to explain , not condemn . 
Gardner says that having survived a similar execution attempt he wanted to show that , by targeting journalists who sought to explain the reasons behind their actions , the militants were only hurting their cause . 
Not that this means forgiving the individuals who shot him and Cumbers . 
`` I will try very hard to be as objective as I was before . 
Do I forgive the people who did this to me ? 
No , of course not . 
They have n't apologised , they showed no mercy . 
I 've had no little note saying , ` Gosh , we feel sorry about what we did . ' '' 
The Saudis claim that two of the five men who shot Gardner and Cumbers have been killed in subsequent shootouts , but have not made clear how they reached this conclusion . 
Nor have they allowed British investigators to talk to the unarmed government minder , whose actions during the attack remain a mystery to Gardner . 
`` It 's particularly tough for Simon 's widow , because , of course , she 'd like to know that the people who killed her husband have been brought to justice or that there 's some kind of accountability . '' 
Gardner gets tired easily these days , but seems astonishingly busy . 
Besides going back to work , writing a book and spending time with his family , he is doing all he can to start walking again . 
He is undergoing physiotherapy at Stanmore hospital . 
`` By the time this piece comes out I will be starting to walk with calipers , but only for an hour or two a day , because it 's pretty exhausting , and it 's not terribly efficient either , which is why a lot of spinally injured patients tend to just stick with a wheelchair , '' he says . 
`` There is still hope , but the prognosis from Stanmore is that I will be a long-term wheelchair user . 
The best end point I think I can hope for is that I will only need splints from the knees downwards . 
I 've been told I will never get my feet back ; my feet are gone , basically . 
They 're still there , but I ca n't feel anything . 
I have continual nerve pain in my legs . 
It keeps me awake at night . 
I never thought that nearly a year on from the injuries I 'd still be in so much pain . '' 
Gardner 's pain specialists have told him they can not increase medication without giving him side effects such as drowsiness and headaches , which he refuses to countenance . 
What he had not realized before about spinal injury , he says , is that feeling sorry for someone in a wheelchair because they ca n't walk is not the half of it . 
`` What you do n't see is the internal stuff . 
When you 're spinally injured you also usually lose control of your bladder and bowels . 
In my case mine were so shot up that I had to have things like catheters and bags anyhow , so it 's irrelevant for me , but for other people , that is one of the hardest things . 
They 're having to use suppositories to empty their bowels , they 're having to put these awful catheters up their genitals - it 's really tough . 
Which is why I think a lot of spinally injured people have this sort of pained expression on their face . 
`` Several things have kept me smiling : being back with my family , writing a book and improving with physio . 
I think there will come a time when my locomotive improvement will hit the buffers , and I think that will be quite a depressing time . 
At which point I 'll start investigating disabled sports such as disabled skiing and scuba diving . 
Life 's got to go on . 
`` I want my life back . 
I accept it 's never going to be the same as the life I had before injury but I 'm determined to make the most of it . 
And one day I 'll go off and do something completely different . '' 
"
2005-04-19,"Tuesday 19 April 2005 00.01 BST Iraq 's new rulers split yesterday over whether to execute Saddam Hussein if he is convicted of war crimes , with President Jalal Talabani facing calls to resign if he refuses to sign a death warrant . 
The Kurdish rebel-turned president said he opposed capital punishment on principle . 
`` Personally , no , I wo n't sign , '' he told the BBC . 
But he hinted he may abstain and pass the decision to the two vice-presidents , Adel Abdul Mahdi , a Shia , and Ghazi Yawar , a Sunni Arab , who with him comprise the presidential council . 
`` My two partners in the presidency , the government , the house , all of them are for sentencing Saddam Hussein to death before the court will decide . 
So , I think I will be alone in this field . '' 
Mr Talabani 's stance prompted a sharp rebuke from the Kurdish bloc 's main coalition ally , a cleric-backed Shia list . 
A parliamentary deputy and spokesman , Ali al-Dabagh , said the United Iraqi Alliance unanimously favored executing Saddam if so ordered by the special tribunal which is expected to start the trial next year . 
`` If the court says he 's a criminal , we will follow it , '' Mr al-Dabagh said . '' 
-LRB- Talabani -RRB- is the president , and he should follow the law . 
If he does n't want to sign it , he should resign the presidency . '' 
Meanwhile , a hostage crisis evaporated when security forces entered Madaen , a town south of Baghdad , and found no evidence that Arab Sunni gunmen had kidnapped scores of Shias and forced others to flee . 
Shia politicians were accused of gross exaggerations for having made claims of `` sectarian cleansing '' .

2005-04-19,"Al-Jazeera : the broadcaster has fallen foul of governments across the Middle East The Iranian authorities have shut down the Tehran offices of al-Jazeera , accusing the broadcaster of inflaming ethnic riots in the south of the country . 
Al-Jazeera said today it had appealed to the government to reverse its decision . 
`` Al-Jazeera assures its audience that it will continue to cover Iranian affairs objectively , comprehensively and in a balanced way , and calls on the relevant Iranian authorities to reconsider the decision to suspend its bureau 's activities , '' the broadcaster said . 
The Arabic news network was first to report the unrest in Iran 's south-west Khuzestan province near the Iraq border , which has led to 200 arrests over the past few days . 
The unrest was also discussed on al-Jazeera 's talkshows , prompting a government investigation into its coverage . 
`` We suspended its activity in Iran to investigate the network 's role in unrest in Ahvaz , '' Mohammad Khoshvaght of the culture and Islamic guidance ministry told state television . 
`` We expect the network to respect Iran 's national integrity and security . 
If it is proved that al-Jazeera committed a crime , it will be prosecuted . '' 
Al-Jazeera is popular among Iran 's Arabs , who are the majority in Khuzestan 's capital Ahwaz but make up only 3 % of the country 's population . 
Persians account for 51 % . 
Al-Jazeera , owned by the government of Qatar , has fallen foul of governments across the Middle East . 
It was banned from reporting in Iraq last year and has angered authorities in Saudi Arabia , Bahrain , Jordan and Kuwait for its policy of airing opposition views and criticisms . 
The US government has also attacked the network for its coverage of the Iraq war .

2005-04-20,"Blonde and giggly , Marla Ruzicka was at first easy to dismiss . 
Yet , single-handedly , the idealistic aid worker secured millions of dollars ' worth of compensation from America for the victims of its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
After her death in a bomb attack in Baghdad last weekend , Rory Carroll mourns his friend It was Christmas in Kabul and she walked into the Mustafa hotel looking like a rumpled doll . 
Blonde hair streaked out from a black headscarf and dust shrouded a beaten-up coat . 
She dumped her backpack on the floor and beamed around a lobby filled with the smell of tobacco and stewed mutton and the stares of Afghan guards and western reporters , all male . 
I 'm Marla ! '' 
It was an exclamation more than a statement . 
This was indeed Marla , a 25-year-old Californian with no satellite phone , very little cash , a shoestring organization and an impossible mission , but any anxieties she may have felt were concealed by a toothy grin . 
It was December 2001 . 
She had come , she said , to document civilian casualties of the recently concluded US-led campaign to oust the Taliban . 
She not only wanted to find them - difficult enough amid lawless chaos - she wanted Washington to compensate them , to take responsibility for mistakes in its post-September 11 offensive . 
It was easy , at first , to patronise and belittle , and many reporters did . 
She gushed and fawned and giggled . 
Everything seemed either cool or awesome . 
She complained about broken nails , wondered whether the market on Chicken Street sold conditioner and asked about parties . 
Planet Marla was located in a parallel , ditzy universe . 
After rising at 4am one morning , the hotel dark and slumbering , I was taken aback to see Bubbles , as she had been nicknamed , waiting in the corridor . 
`` Thanks for letting me come . '' 
I had n't mentioned the trip , nor invited her , but she wedged between a colleague and me for the ride to Qalaye Niazi , a village recently attacked by American bombers on the grounds it harboured fugitive members of the Taliban and al-Qaida . 
The Pentagon had claimed a clean hit with no collateral damage , but amid the debris were bloodied children 's shoes , the scalp of a woman with braided gray hair , and wedding decorations . 
Survivors said dozens of men , women and children had died . 
Marla wrote it all down , asked lots of questions and returned to Kabul silent and thoughtful . 
Last Saturday , almost three and a half years later , a journey which started in the Afghan winter ended on a balmy spring afternoon in Baghdad . 
A suicide car bomber attacked a convoy of SUVs on the airport road . 
Marla Ruzicka and her colleague Faiz Al Salaam , 43 , were separate from the convoy but their ordinary car took the force of the blast , killing them both . 
She had summoned the foreign press corps to a party that night at the Hamra hotel and her failure to show was our first inkling that something was wrong . 
The next morning the deaths were confirmed . 
Marla suffered burns to 90 % of her body . 
A medic who treated her at the scene reported her last words : `` I 'm alive . '' 
Her friends , a global community since she befriended pretty much everyone she met , are stunned . 
There is a hush around the Hamra hotel , low-voiced huddles swapping Marla stories . 
The best is one that relates how she came to be taken seriously , touched countless lives and changed US policy . 
`` Everyone who met Marla was struck by her incredible effervescence and commitment , '' said Kenneth Roth , executive director of Human Rights Watch . 
`` She was courageous and relentless in pursuit of accurate information about civilians caught up in war . '' 
Senator Patrick Leahy , a Vermont Democrat , said it was Marla 's idea to put a special fund in last year 's foreign aid bill to compensate Iraqis whose businesses had been bombed by mistake . 
`` Just from the force of her personality , we decided to take a chance on it . '' 
Leahy said $ 10m was added to the foreign aid bill last year and another $ 10m had been set aside for next year . 
A memorial will be held in Washington this week and the senator will pay tribute from the Senate floor . 
`` I said to her father this morning : ' A lot of people spend their whole lives and do not begin to accomplish what she 's done . ' '' 
It is not difficult to reconcile Bubbles of Kabul with the human rights heroine whose face has filled newspapers and television screens during the past few days . 
Marla did not change . 
The lobbying grew more polished and sophisticated but she was as bubbly at the beginning as the end . 
What changed was that powerful people took notice . 
She was born in Lakeport , near San Francisco , with her twin brother Mark the youngest of six children of Clifford and Nancy Ruzicka , middle-class Republicans . 
She was suspended for leading a school protest against the first Gulf war and as a student at Long Island University visited Cuba , Guatemala , Costa Rica and Israel , including Palestinian areas . 
Police carted her away when she whipped off a sarong with a protest slogan at a speech by George Bush , then governor of Texas . 
On behalf of Global Exchange , a San Francisco-based advocacy group that is run by Medea Benjamin , she visited Afghanistan in 2001 to document cases of wounded and bereaved civilians . 
The US government was not counting them and much of the media and other human rights groups balked at visiting remote , dangerous areas to interview survivors . 
Some of us called it Marla 's mad mission . 
After a break I returned to Kabul in April 2002 and found the wide-eyed wonder of December transformed into a networking queen who knew all the journalists , peacekeepers , aid workers and politicians . 
She had lured Bianca Jagger to the capital . 
Marla would totter around parties in heels and slinky dresses , vodka in hand , making introductions . 
The socialising bordered on the frenzied and sometimes ended with Marla slumped , but not before the room had been worked for anything useful for an unofficial survey which confirmed 824 dead . 
The US embassy loathed Marla , not least for the day she assembled dozens of mostly Pashtun tribesmen , some bandaged and limping , in front of its walls to demand compensation . 
The stunt received wide coverage . 
Marla was becoming a media star , popping up on CNN and becoming the subject of a biography . 
Publicity for the cause , she said , relishing the attention . 
Boyfriends came and went , but she often hinted at loneliness . 
In a recent online journal entry she wrote : `` I am young , and new at this and developing ways to cope , but in honesty I have tried red wine a little too much for medicine , deprived myself of sleep and felt extremely inadequate . '' 
The furious energy never abated . 
Lobbying , traveling , kickboxing and partying were her therapy . 
After Afghanistan she founded her own NGO , the Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict -LRB- Civic -RRB- , rented an office in Washington DC and forged ties with congressmen such as Leahy . 
When Donald Rumsfeld testified at a Senate hearing , she engaged him on his way out and quietly made her case , figuring it would be more effective than protesting . 
She was in Baghdad for the March 2003 invasion and mobilised 150 volunteers to visit hospitals and attempt to make the first proper list of people killed or injured by US forces . 
Their total of more than 2,000 dead formed the basis for subsequent estimates which touched 20,000 . 
For a time she stayed at the Guardian house before worsening security forced her and the correspondents into the Hamra hotel . 
Counting became a means to gain attention and help for casualties who would otherwise be ignored . 
In an essay sent to Human Rights Watch shortly before she died , Marla wrote : `` A number is important not only to quantify the cost of the war , but to me each number is also a story of someone whose hopes , dreams and potential will never be realized , and who left behind a family . '' 
Some Iraqis were bemused by the blonde who would burst from a black ankle-length abaya , worn to disguise herself as a local , hugging and kissing their children , but she won the respect of families who were given the hope of financial and medical aid . 
It would not have been possible without Faiz Al Salaam , a commercial pilot with Iraq Air who had become Marla 's driver , fixer and translator . 
A witty , urbane man , he recently became a father and hinted at quitting his perilous sideline . 
Last June , Marla wrote about the airport road in her online journal : `` The ride is not pleasant . 
Military convoys passing every moment . 
Faiz and I hold our breath . '' 
The target of Saturday 's attack appears to have been a convoy of civilian contractors who happened to be passing the couple when the bomber struck . 
Witnesses described the car of Faiz and Marla bursting into flames . 
A French national also died and six people were injured . 
Faiz 's relatives identified Marla 's body but have yet to retrieve his corpse , possibly because it was so badly damaged . 
Friends had advised Marla against returning to Baghdad . 
But the 28-year-old said she needed to collect fresh stories for fundraising and so checked back into the Hamra last month , bearing cheese , chocolate and cigars for fellow guests . 
She knocked on the doors of the few people she did not know . 
I 'm Marla ! '' 
Helping the relatives of an infant whose parents were killed when their vehicle was hit by what was believed to be an American rocket became a particular passion . 
She praised individual US commanders for wanting to do the right thing but complained about bureaucratic obstacles . 
Last Friday , Marla left a telephone message to her parents : `` Mom and Dad , I love you . 
I 'm OK . '' 
Her mother , Nancy , said they were worried but knew better than to tell their children to do anything . 
`` We were supportive and just reminded her to be careful . '' 
At a Marla-instigated gathering that same night , her last , she was in her element , taking people aside for chats , raving about the food and promising to quit smoking any minute . 
To my eyes she had not aged a day since Kabul but she batted away the remark . 
Something about the air in Baghdad dried the skin , she said , rubbing her temples . 
`` Once I hit 30 I 'm going to get old really quickly . '' 
The thought struck her as funny and she laughed . 
Like a MacBook Pro '' says @Mister_Solomon : Westminster Dog Show - live !

2005-04-20,"Wednesday 20 April 2005 16.26 BST The bodies of 69 people , apparently victims of separate insurgent attacks , were discovered in two locations in Iraq today . 
The Iraqi president , Jalal Talabani , reported that the bodies of 50 people had been dragged from the Tigris river south of Baghdad . 
They are believed to be hostages held by insurgents in Madaen , a town south of Baghdad , since earlier this week . 
`` More than 50 bodies have been brought out from the Tigris , and we have the full names of those who were killed and those criminals who committed these crimes , '' Mr Talabani told reporters . 
`` We will give you details in the coming days ... terrorists committed crimes there . '' 
Mr Talabani gave no details about when or where the victims were abducted or found , saying only that the interim prime minister , Ayad Allawi , would deal with the matter . 
However , he provided the information in response to a question about the search for hostages reportedly seized from the Madaen region , south of Baghdad . 
Shia leaders and government officials claimed last week that Sunni militants had abducted as many as 100 Shia residents from the area , but when Iraqi forces moved into Madaen , they found no captives . 
Later , Shia officials said that dozens of bodies had been found in the Tigris river south of Madaen , but residents and police in the area who spoke to the Reuters news agency said they had not seen any bodies . 
Today Mr Talabani insisted : `` It is not true that there were no hostages . 
There were , but they were killed and they threw the bodies into the Tigris . '' 
Meanwhile , residents said they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of 19 Iraqi men in a soccer stadium in Haditha , a town 140 miles north of Baghad . 
Usama Rauf and Ousama Halim , both taxi drivers , said they heard gunshots and rushed to the stadium where they saw the bodies lined up against a bloodstained wall . 
An Iraqi reporter and other residents counted 19 bodies and said all of them appeared to have been shot . 
Residents said they believed the victims , all men in civilian clothes , were soldiers abducted by insurgents as they headed home for tomorrow 's holiday marking the birthday of the prophet Muhammad . 
Walid al-Hadithi , a doctor in the town 's hospital , told Reuters that the murders followed clashes in the area between national guardsmen , US troops and rebels . 
US forces said they were investigating , and Iraqi military officials said they had no immediate information .

2005-04-20,"Wednesday 20 April 2005 19.40 BST Tony Blair will receive a major boost tomorrow when the Sun endorses Labor for the general election on May 5 , citing the prime minister 's bravery over the Iraq war . 
Labor strategists , who regarded the Sun 's endorsement in 1997 as one of the key moments of the campaign , will sigh with relief that Rupert Murdoch has not consummated his flirtation with Michael Howard . 
No Tory leader since Margaret Thatcher has been wooed in the same way as Mr Howard , who was invited to address the News Corporation annual jamboree in Cancun , Mexico . 
The decision by the Sun editor , Rebekah Wade , after close consultation with her Australian born boss , will come as little surprise to Labor and the Conservatives . 
Mr Murdoch is always careful to back winners and he has regularly lavished praise on the prime minister for standing firm during the Iraq war . 
But speculation that the Sun might return to the Tory fold for the first time since 1992 was fuelled when Mr Murdoch told the BBC 's business editor , Jeff Randall , that he was impressed by Mr Howard 's leadership of the Tory party . 
But in remarks which received little attention at the time , he also said he would never forget Mr Blair 's steadfastness during the Iraq war . 
The move by the Sun , which comes mid-way through the election campaign , will add to a growing sense that the Tories are struggling . 
The paper has consistently been in tune with the national mood , not least after it famously asked the readers to turn out the lights if Neil Kinnock won in 1992 . 
The Conservative leadership is likely to be relaxed about the result because they knew they were only likely to receive the paper 's backing if they were well ahead in the polls . 
It is understood that the Sun will be critical of the prime minister 's handling of domestic policies , echoing many of the Tories ' criticisms .

2005-04-21,"Full text : Blair 's Newsnight interview The prime minister talked about tax , immigration and his own future with the BBC 's Jeremy Paxman . 
But first , as ever , came the war Thursday 21 April 2005 17.48 BST Paxman : Hello , welcome to the second of three interviews with the leaders of the three big parties , who want our votes on May 5 . 
On Friday , it 's Michael Howard ; this evening I 'm in Leeds with the prime minister , Tony Blair . 
Prime Minister , is there anything you would like to apologise for ? 
Blair : Well , if you want me apologise for the war in Iraq , I 'm afraid I ca n't say sorry we removed Saddam . 
No , if you 're asking me other things I 've got wrong over the past eight years , I 've already said there are certain things that any government gets wrong . 
I suppose I 've had my share of those . 
Paxman : But do you accept that there is a trust issue , and that the reason opposition parties can talk about wiping the smirk off your face is because you ca n't any longer say : ` Look at me . 
I 'm a pretty straight kind of guy ' ? 
Blair : Well , trust is an issue . 
But then people are going to have decide , you know : are we to be trusted when we say we 've run a strong economy and we 'll continue to do so with low interest rates and low unemployment and low inflation ? 
I said that we would put investment into the public services ; we have . 
You go and look at any school or hospital ; you look at this city here and how it 's been transformed in the past few years . 
Look at the investment in the local regeneration of an inner city such as Leeds . 
Now , if you 're talking about Iraq , yes , there 's an issue because people , some people , feel they were misled over the war and some people powerfully disagree with the reason why we went to war . 
Paxman : All right , let 's look at Iraq . 
When you told parliament that the intelligence was `` extensive , detailed and authoritative '' , that was n't true , was it ? 
Blair : No , it was true . 
There was no doubt about ... Paxman : It was n't extensive , it was n't detailed and it was n't authoritative . 
Blair : I 'm sorry : it was . 
And the great thing about this now for any member of the public is that thanks to the Butler report - and remember , we 've had four separate inquiries into whether this intelligence was misused or not - each of them have come to the same conclusion , and people can actually go and look on the website and they can go and study the Joint Intelligence Committee reports that I got . 
Blair : And see the intelligence that was given to us . 
Paxman : OK , but you know , do n't you , that just two weeks before you made that statement the Joint Intelligence Committee said that ` intelligence remains limited '' . 
Blair : Of course , intelligence always is limited , but ... Paxman : Well , therefore it 's not extensive , detailed and authoritative , is it ? 
Blair : No , it ... I 'm sorry , their judgment was absolutely clear . 
Look , the one , the one thing you can do is go and read it . 
It said that Saddam Hussein ... Blair : -LRB- It said he -RRB- had chemical and biological weapons ; that he could manufacture new stocks of VX and sarin agent within months of doing so . 
That he could use those weapons against not just military targets but strategic targets . 
You can go and read it . 
Paxman : They said it was limited ; you said it was ` extensive , detailed and authoritative ' . 
Blair : They also made it clear that there was extensive intelligence about Saddam . 
They said , however , of course it 's necessarily limited : intelligence always is . 
Paxman : So was the JIC , the Joint Intelligence Committee , report wrong ? 
Blair : No , they were n't wrong in what they reported at the time ; they were absolutely right . 
But later it transpired that ... Blair : Some , not all , of that intelligence was wrong . 
But the decision I had to take at the time was whether as a result of that intelligence we could conclude Saddam was in breach of United Nations resolutions , and I concluded he was . 
And I may say the evidence is that he indeed was in breach of UN resolutions . 
Paxman : Well , so when you wrote in the forward to the dossier that the threat from Saddam was ` serious and current ' , it was n't . 
And indeed your own chief of staff , Jonathan Powell , had said the dossier did nothing to demonstrate a threat . 
Blair : No , I 'm sorry . 
The evidence that we presented was absolutely clearly set out in the Joint Intelligence Committee reports . 
You 've had four inquires in to this . 
We subjected ourselves as a government , me as a prime minister , to a more extensive inquiry than any government has ever given , and what I 'd simply ask people to do , instead of continually attacking my integrity over Iraq ... I 've never disrespected people who have taken a different point of view . 
But I had to take a decision in the best interests of the country ; I took that decision . 
I can not , I 'm afraid , apologise for having taken it . 
I believe still it was the right thing to do . 
I understand the fact ... Paxman : Despite the fact there were no weapons of mass destruction Blair : That disagree with ... Yes , because ... Paxman : And you told us there were . 
Blair : The legal case was the breach of United Nations resolutions . 
The evidence from the Iraq survey group is that he was indeed in breach of UN resolutions , and incidentally it was n't just us in Britain that concluded he had WMD : the entire United Nations concluded that , which is why they passed resolution 14.41 . 
Paxman : Did you see the Foreign Office legal advice which said military action against Iraq would be ` illegal without a further UN resolution ' ? 
BLAIR : No , I had the attorney general 's advice to guide me . 
But again this thing has been built in to , you know , a Paxman : You did n't see that Foreign Office advice saying that an invasion would be illegal without a second UN resolution ? 
Blair : No , because I had the attorney general 's advice . 
Paxman : You did n't see it ? 
Blair : Yes , I did n't see it . 
But I had the attorney general 's advice , and the attorney general made it absolutely clear that provided we could show that there were breaches of the United Nations resolutions ... Paxman : The attorney general is a political appointment , Prime Minister . 
Should n't you have seen the Foreign Office legal advice ? 
BLAIR : But the attorney general 's advice is the advice he gives us as the law officer . 
He acts in an independent way in doing that . 
Paxman : Do you accept any responsibility at all for the death of Dr David Kelly . 
Blair : It was a terrible , terrible thing to have happened . 
I do n't believe we had any option , however , but to disclose his name because I think had we failed to do so , that would have been seen as attempting to conceal something from the committee that was looking into this at the time . 
And again ... Paxman : Do you accept any responsibility at all ? 
Blair : In relation to this . 
Blair : No , I 've said what I 've said , and I feel desperately sorry for his family and indeed for the terrible ordeal that they were put through . 
But as I said at the time - and again , this has been gone into time and time again - if we had concealed the fact , because this whole row was about the information that - as you know , we 've been over this many , many times - had been given to the BBC reporter , he had then come forward and said to his superiors : `` This is me . 
I think it 's me who 's responsible for having given this story '' ... There was a Foreign affairs select committee report going at the time . 
I think if we 'd concealed that from people , we would have been subject to a different type of allocation . 
Paxman : So the short answer to the question is , you do n't accept any responsibility . 
Blair : Well , it 's not a question of not accepting responsibility ; it is a question of simply explaining the circumstances . 
Paxman : It 's a question to which you could give a yes or no answer , Prime Minister . 
Blair : Yeah , but it 's maybe not a question you need to give a yes or no answer to . 
Paxman : All right . 
You keep referring to these inquiries . 
The inquiry that you set up under Lord Butler concluded that what went wrong there was partly the consequence of your style of government , so-called sofa government . 
Will your next government , if you have one , be any different ? 
Blair : I do n't run a sofa style of government . 
There were over 20 cabinet discussions of the Iraq war . 
Paxman : Lord Butler said : `` We are concerned that the informality and circumscribed character of the government 's procedures , which we saw in the context of policymaking towards Iraq , risks reducing the scope for informed , collective , political judgment . '' 
Are we going to see a different style of government in future , if you are in government ? 
Blair : We have a government that involves people fully . 
I 'm sorry , I do n't accept that we did not discuss Iraq in a proper way : we did . 
Paxman : How many times did the ministerial defense and overseas policy committee meet in the run-up to war ? 
Blair : It did n't have to meet the whole ... Paxman : It did n't meet at all , did it . 
Blair : Well , hang on . 
It did n't have to meet , Jeremy , because we had an ad hoc committee of ministers that were meeting virtually daily at points . 
Paxman : And that is precisely what Lord Butler criticised . 
Blair : No , he does n't criticise that , actually ; that 's completely different from the so-called sofa style of government . 
Look , I want to make this point to you because you can go on , over and over and over , about these events that have happened . 
In the end , I had a decision to make back in March 2003 . 
We had 250,000 UK and US troops there ; we had Saddam not in compliance with UN resolutions . 
I tried desperately hard to get a second UN resolution . 
I could n't get one . 
Now I had a decision to make as to whether to leave Saddam there , in breach of UN resolutions , and end up in a situation with the international community humiliated and him emboldened , or to remove him . 
I decided to remove him . 
Now , you can go through these issues about my integrity , my character , the legal advice - because the legal advice , actually , the legal issue , was exactly the same as the political issue - or you can accept that in the end a decision had to be taken ; there was no middle way , there was no fence to sit on . 
I took that decision . 
Now , I know people strongly disagreed with it . 
In the end , I had to take the decision as prime minister that I thought was right for the country , and I did so . 
Paxman : The problem is , Prime Minister , that the next time the Joint Intelligence Committee come to you and say , `` We have extensive , authoritative intelligence of a threat or possible threat to this country . 
We urge pre-emptive action , '' you wo n't be able to sell it to the public . 
Blair : Well , let 's wait and see if that ever happens - and I hope it never does . 
But I think that people , actually , when they look at this , despite all the stuff , because continually this argument is conducted ... Paxman : Why should they believe you again ? 
Blair : Because in the end , people have got to make a judgment about this . 
This was not an easy decision to take ; it was a hard decision . 
Blair : I took the decision I thought was right , and if I had not taken that decision , then what ? 
You 'd have Saddam Hussein and his sons still running Iraq ; you would n't have 8 million Iraqis going out voting at the polls ; you would n't have change spreading across the Middle East as it is . 
There has been a lot that has happened on the other side of the argument that , just occasionally , we should also pay attention to . 
Paxman : Although those , of course , are not the grounds on which you told us we should go to war at the time . 
Blair : The grounds were , the legal case was , breaches of UN resolutions . 
He was in breach of UN resolutions . 
But again , if I may say , this again has been completely rewritten afterwards . 
Blair : I spoke about the regime and the nature of regime continually , because what I said to people was : `` This is a difficult situation but let us , if we have to remove them , remove them with a clear conscience , because this is a man responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths . '' 
Paxman : This matters also , Prime Minister , because during your time in office you have committed British forces to battle on five separate occasions . 
On past form , we can expect if you 're returned to Downing Street they might be committed another couple of times in another Blair government . 
You have n't given George Bush any undertakings about anywhere else in the world , have you ? 
Blair : I have n't given him any undertakings about anywhere and I do n't make the decision according to what the president of the United States might want . 
I make it according to what I think are in the interests of this country , and if you look at the military action we 've taken in respect of Kosovo , right , well , we could have opted out of that , too , but look what happened in the early 1990s , when hundreds of thousands of people died in the Balkans . 
We took military action in Afghanistan . 
Look at the democratic election that 's happening there . 
We took the action in Iraq , and I explained that already . 
We took the action in Sierra Leone , where we saved a country ' democracy from a gang of murderous gangsters , you know , and I going to do ... No , I 'm sorry . 
I think we can be proud of what the magnificent British armed forces have done , and those decisions , some of them , particularly Iraq , were very difficult . 
Paxman : While we 're on defense , Prime Minister , the British independent nuclear deterrent is going to need replacing , probably a decision that has to be taken in the next government that takes office after May 5 . 
Will you replace it . 
Blair : Well , we 've got to retain our nuclear deterrent , and we 've had an independent nuclear deterrent for a long time . 
Now that decision is for another time , but in principle I believe it 's important to retain our own independent deterrent . 
Paxman : A continuing independent nuclear deterrent . 
Blair : I believe that is the right thing for the country . 
I think it 's important that however we look at all the different aspects of it ... And a decision has n't yet been taken . 
Paxman : And the billions of pounds that are involved , you 're prepared to make available ? 
Blair : Well , we have to see . 
Cost is one aspect to it . 
But I think it 's important this country retains a strong defense at all times . 
Paxman : Would cost convince you not to go ahead with it ? 
Blair : You just ... Look , there 's no point in speculating about that at the moment because we 're a long way off taking the decision . 
Paxman : Just while we 're on foreign affairs : there 's a new Pope appointed . 
Do you agree that ... Blair : Now , that 's one election I ca n't comment on , I 'm afraid . 
Paxman : Do you agree that condoms prevent the spread of Aids ? 
Blair : Yes , I do . 
Paxman : Would you be prepared to tell the Pope that ? 
Blair : Jeremy , I mean , you know , I 've ... I do n't know . 
If I ever have this conversation with him , I 'm sure we will talk about how we can do lots of things to help the world , but I do n't want to ... I 've got enough issues in my own election without getting into his . 
Paxman : Let 's look at tax . 
Before the last election , you made exactly the same promise you 're making this time : no increase in the basic rate of tax ; no increase the higher rate of tax ; no commitment at all on national insurance . 
You spoke to us , very kindly , before that election , and I suggested to you that any reasonable person would therefore conclude that after the election , you would raise the basic rate of national insurance . 
You said that we should n't make such an assumption , and then you did it . 
You 're not expecting us to fall for that a second time are you ? 
Blair : Well , it was n't a question of falling for it the first time . 
The fact is ... Paxman : Well , we did . 
We took you at your word . 
Hang on a minute . 
I was asked the question , is there a reason why , in the government 's proposal you should raise national insurance ? 
I said you should n't make any assumption about that at all . 
Paxman : Would n't any reasonable person suppose that you therefore propose to increase national insurance contributions ? 
Blair : For exactly the reason I 've just given . 
Blair : Yeah , but you were saying to me , as I recall it : `` Look , your spending proposals mean you 're going to have to put up taxes . '' 
Now the reason why we ended up putting 1 % on national insurance was because subsequent to the election we got a report on the National Health Service that said you 're going to have to raise spending by more than you had thought in order to make sure that you get a proper and full financing of the National Health Service . 
So the actual commitments ... Paxman : But Prime Minister , you had committed before the election to raise the National Health spending to the European average . 
You made that commitment before the election . 
And in the manifesto what we said was that the commitments we had could be financed by the taxes that had been set aside . 
What happened after the election was , we got a report that said : no , actually , if you want to reach the European Union average , the figures are n't as you supposed they are . 
You 're going to have to raise it further in order to do that . 
And that 's why we did it , and that 's why we 've got the 1 % national insurance . 
Now that was a catch-up in the health service , but you know , it was necessary . 
Paxman : There could be any old report coming along after this election which will necessitate you raising taxes again . 
Blair : I think the health service is a special case . 
But look , in the end people again are going to have to make a judgment about it . 
I ca n't , I ca n't sit here and write the budget for every year of a Labor government . 
What I can say to people is , overall , our taxes are actually lower than the European average , and they 're lower as a proportion of our national income than most of the years that Margaret Thatcher was in power . 
Paxman : You are going to have to raise taxes after the election , are n't you ? 
Blair : No , you ca n't say that on the basis of the spending plans we have . 
Paxman : Well , you ca n't give us a commitment ; you wo n't . 
Blair : Well ... if you remember , we had precisely the same discussion before , and not just in relation to national insurance but other taxes , too . 
And what I said to you then , and I say it to you now , is the spending proposals that we have are adequately catered for by the tax plans that we 've got . 
Paxman : And there is no question , on your watch , of a local income tax ever being introduced . 
I mean , well ... We have a review into the council tax and what 's the right way to replace it , so you ca n't as it were foreclose options but for , for me the local income tax has always been a problem because it 's all very well for the Lib Dems to say , get rid of the council tax , and everyone says , well , that 's fantastic . 
But if you 're a two-earner or three-earner household , you 're going to pay a lot more money under local income tax . 
Paxman : So no local income tax on your watch . 
Blair : Well , as I say , we 've got a review , so I 'm not going to , I ca n't start closing everything off , but what I can say to you is , personally , and I think I 've said this on many occasions , I think there are big problems of local income tax . 
Paxman : You 've promised assistance to those people at the Rover works who will lose their jobs . 
What is the moral difference between those people losing their jobs and the tens of thousands of civil servants you propose should lose their jobs ? 
Blair : Well , one is happening as an immediate redundancy . 
I mean , they 've actually been handed their redundancy notices . 
The other will happen over time . 
Paxman : They 've still got mortgages to pay . 
Which is why it 's being structured over a period of time , so that we can help people , retrain and get other jobs , and the one thing we 've done as a government , I think quite successfully , is , wherever there are large-scale job losses ... But Rover is different : you 've got 6,000 jobs going immediately , jobs in the supply chain going immediately . 
You should go there and try and support them and give some support to the infrastructure . 
Paxman : And what was it in your analysis of what was wrong with Britain that convinced you that what this country needed was 40 super casinos ? 
BLAIR : Well , the question is : how do you prevent that happening ? 
It 's not a question of , do you think it 's what the country needs . 
Is n't it sensible to have an overhaul of the gambling laws ? 
Paxman : Despite , you know , the social damage that is caused by addictive gambling ? 
Blair : Yeah , but that 's not the question . 
We actually are setting up for the first time a gambling commission that will look into these issues and make recommendations . 
People think you can go down the street now and gamble . 
You can gamble your mortgage away on putting money on a horse or , you know , take a bet on the election . 
The point is , this type of larger casino , which is a big leisure complex , properly run , is it a disaster for the country ? 
I do n't think so . 
I think that if you look at the evidence of where these large-scale casinos have been introduced , it does n't bear out the opponents ' case at all , and I might just point out to you that until , certainly the newspapers started running a campaign on this , virtually everyone was in favor of these proposals . 
Paxman : Can you tell us how many failed asylum seekers there are in this country ? 
Blair : No , I ca n't be sure of the numbers of people who are illegals in this country . 
For the same reason that the previous government could n't . 
What I can say is that the asylum system has been toughened up and tightened up hugely , and according to the United Nations commission for refugees and not us , asylum figures have fallen by more than a half in the past two or three years . 
Paxman : Can you give us a rough idea of how many there may be ? 
Is it tens of thousands ? 
Blair : I 've said I do n't think there 's any point in speculating . 
Paxman : But you have no idea . 
Blair : Well , it 's not a question of having no idea . 
Paxman : Well , what is your idea , Prime Minister ? 
Blair : What you can say is , how people are applying for asylum , month by month , how many people you are removing and what is the backlog , and we are dealing with all of those issues . 
Paxman : Prime Minister , you have really no idea of how many failed asylum seekers there are illegally in this country ? 
Blair : It is difficult , for the very reason that ... Blair : Hang on . 
For the very reason that the previous government gave , you can not determine specifically how many people are here illegally . 
Paxman : You have no idea . 
Blair : What you can say is , here are the number of people that are actually currently applying for asylum . 
Blair : This is the backlog of claims that you 're dealing with . 
And these are the people who are being removed from the country . 
Paxman : Do people not come to you and say : we think , Prime Minister , there may be 100,000 or 250,000 , or 500,000 ... Blair : They do n't come and say that . 
Paxman : So you have no idea . 
Blair : No , hang on a minute . 
You have an idea of the numbers that are claiming , the backlog , and the numbers that are being removed . 
Some of those asylum seekers , when they fail and their claim fails , they will go back voluntarily . 
Paxman : What 's your working assumption ? 
Blair : I do n't make a working assumption about it . 
What I do is I concentrate on the bits that are absolutely vital to concentrate on , which is - hang on , just let me finish - which is the numbers who are coming in , the numbers we 're removing and the backlog . 
The only long-term way of dealing with this issue , however , is to introduce the proper controls of borders through an electronic visa regime . 
And the other thing is identity cards . 
Paxman : Does the fact that you 're unable or unwilling to tell us indicate that you have in fact lost control of our borders ? 
Blair : No , it does n't indicate that , beause no government has ever been able to say that . 
What you are able to say however is , here are the measures that we 're taking to control it properly , to deal with the abuses , and you are also able to say , which I can say to you very clearly because we keep the proper statistics of this , is the numbers that are claiming now and the numbers that we 're removing , and the way to get asylum figures down so that it 's only genuine refugees you 're taking ; to do precisely what we 've done : clean up the system , remove the tiers of appeal , make sure that people ca n't destroy their documentation when they come here and improve the removal system . 
We 're doing all of those things . 
Paxman : And just one final time , you have no figure that you can give us for the number of refused asylum seekers who are in this country . 
Blair : I 'm giving you the information that I 've got , and I 've answered that question . 
Paxman : You ca n't give us any kind of figure . 
Blair : The reason is because some people will return after their asylum claim has failed . 
So you have no idea . 
Blair : Well , what you have is an idea of the numbers that are coming in and claiming and the numbers that you 're removing . 
Now , those are the two important things to concentrate on . 
Paxman : Well , what is that number ? 
Blair : The number coming in now , it 's fallen to just over about 2,000 a month who are claiming asylum , and that 's down from , at its height , around 8,000 a month . 
And actually , that is lower than the figure in March 1997 . 
Paxman : But it gives us no indication of the backlog , of course . 
Blair : Well , no , sorry , it does give me an indication . 
Blair : No , no , no , Jeremy . 
You can say what the backlog is of claims . 
The backlog of claims , I think , is down to round about 10,000 . 
That 's down from 60,000 that we inherited . 
In respect of removals , there were one in five asylum seekers who failed , were being removed . 
It 's now half of them that are being removed . 
And the answer that I have given to you on the numbers of illegals here is precisely the answer we have always given , and the last government gave . 
Paxman : Although you 've not given us a number . 
Blair : Well , I 've just explained to you why it 's impossible to do that . 
But what you can do is give numbers for the other things . 
Paxman : Let 's look at economic migrants . 
Is there an upper limit to the number of economic migrants who should be allowed into this country ? 
Blair : Well , there 's an arbitrary limit or a quota , in my view , but there 's going to be a limit set by what your economy needs . 
Paxman : What does our economy need ? 
Blair : And the points system that we 're introducing will make sure that only people get work permits who actually come in and we need for our economy . 
Paxman : What does our economy need ? 
Blair : Well , at the moment , I think ... Well , I have n't got the exact figure off the top of my head , but I think it 's about 130,000 come in with work permits , but most of those people will come in , work for a time and go again . 
Paxman : Your previous home secretary , David Blunkett , told us that he saw no obvious upper limit . 
Blair : No , what he 's saying is exactly the same as me . 
The Tories say you set a quota . 
Supposing you get a major company that says - I mean , here we are , a company of law offices here which is actually connected with an American company - supposing they need someone to come in from abroad for a short time . 
Why should n't you have them in ? 
The point is to make sure that you have strict controls that mean the only people your economy needs to come into this country come into this country . 
Paxman : But you have predictions of the economic growth of this country . 
You know roughly what 's going to happen with the labor market . 
Why are you so shy of just putting a rough figure on it ? 
Blair : Well , you can take the figures now . 
I do n't think the figures on work permits have changed that much in the past few years . 
But the reason I should n't put a figure on it , is that I do n't run every business in the country . 
Supposing you get a business in the City of London that says , actually , we need 50 people in this specialty to come in and work here for six months . 
You 'll do tremendous damage to your economy if you start taking out all migrant labor . 
Or for , even more absurdly , parliament to come along and say we , parliament , suddenly know what the needs of employers are in the country , it makes no sense to do that . 
Paxman : Prime Minister , if you are returned to Downing Street on May 6 , can you at least give us a guarantee that within , say , 12 months of your handing in your cards as prime minister , there would be a general election ? 
Blair : Well , I 've said I 'll service a full term , and you know ... Again , I mean , I 've been over this . 
Paxman : But people are entitled to know what they 're voting for , are n't they ? 
Blair : Yeah , absolutely . 
That 's why I 've said ... Paxman : Or what they 're going to get . 
Blair : I 'll serve the full term . 
And they 'll get New Labor . 
Paxman : So that means , by the time there 's a new American President coming on his first visit to Britain in 2009 , you will still be in Downing Street . 
Blair : Well , people elect me , but I have n't won the election yet . 
Paxman : But if you 're elected , you will still be in Downing Street ? 
Blair : I 've said I 'll serve the full term , and exactly what situation happens then and how you hand over , well you can leave that to a later time . 
But it 's not unknown , you know , for there are countries with fixed-term parliaments . 
Paxman : Oh , absolutely . 
Blair : There are other prime ministers who 've said : `` Look , this is my ... I 'll serve this term but I wo n't serve another term . '' 
I mean , I think the public actually has a very clear and sensible view of this . 
Paxman : Have you told Gordon Brown when you 're going to stand down ? 
Blair : No , I 've said to Gordon the same as I 've said to everyone : if you elect the prime minister , you serve the term . 
Paxman : So if there is any deal between the two of you , it 's a deal just in Gordon Brown 's mind . 
Blair : You do n't do deals about jobs like this . 
And Gordon and I have actually been working extremely closely together . 
It 's been a great partnership . 
I hope it 's also been a good partnership for the country . 
I mean , we 've known each other for 20 years , and he 's been a magnificent chancellor . 
He 's produced tremendous economic strength in this country , and you know , we can be proud , I hope , of what we 've achieved for the country . 
Paxman : So this deal is just in his mind . 
Blair : Well , I think you going on about what is in his mind ... As far as I 'm aware , as I think he was saying this morning , as we sat on the sofa together , , you know , we were there together to serve as prime minister and chancellor . 
Paxman : When you look at your time in Downing Street , when you came in 1997 , you were a young man . 
You were talking about the ... Blair : You 're not going to show the old pictures , are you ? 
None of us can really survive that . 
Paxman : But you came in , a young prime minister talking about a young country . 
Now they talk about how you 've got a fake tan . 
You have n't got a fake tan , I take it . 
Blair : I have n't got a fake tan . 
As a matter of fact , you look as if you 've been sitting out in the sun as well . 
Paxman : Well , actually , I have n't , no. . 
I know that 's your story . 
You ca n't make that claim any more that you 're a young man in a young country . 
Is n't there a point where you think : God , it 's going to be great to be shot of all of this ? 
Blair : Well , not at the moment because I still think we 've got things to do . 
I 'm not saying the irony of this job is that you 're less popular as you go on , but in some ways you 're better equipped to do the job . 
And I feel that we 're just really poised on the health service , education reform , a lot of the stuff we 're doing on law and order . 
I think with the economy there 's a whole new series of things we 've got to do about science , technology , apprenticeship , vocational skills and , you know , there 's masses for me to do . 
And that 's what gets you up in the morning : it 's recognizing that whatever ghastly stuff is appearing from time to time in the media , you 've still got the energy and the determination to do the job . 
And then I 've a limit on my time doing it and then it 's for somebody else to take on the baton and run with it . 
But I still feel there 's things we 've got to do , and I think we can accelerate the change , drive it faster in this third term . 
But we 've got to get elected first . 
Paxman : Tony Blair , thank you .

2005-04-26,"Brian Sedgemore -LRB- r -RRB- with Charles Kennedy this morning . 
Photograph : Gareth Fuller\/PA Brian Sedgemore , a Labor MP for 27 years , has defected to the Liberal Democrats and urged voters to give Tony Blair a `` bloody nose '' at the general election next week . 
Mr Sedgemore , who is standing down from parliament and not contesting his Hackney South and Shoreditch seat , said he was leaving Labor after becoming increasingly disillusioned with the government over the Iraq war and `` authoritarian '' anti-terrorism legislation . 
He accused the prime minister of telling `` stomach-turning lies '' over Iraq and using the `` politics of fear to drive through parliament a deeply authoritarian set of law and order measures '' . 
Making his first appearance as a Lib Dem this morning , he said : `` It is against this background I decided I could no longer support the Labor party and would join the Liberal Democrats . '' 
`` I urge everyone from the center and the left of British politics to give Tony Blair a bloody nose in the general election . '' 
The Liberal Democrat leader , Charles Kennedy , sought to use Mr Sedgemore 's defection as evidence that voting for his party would not be a `` wasted '' vote , resulting merely in the election of a Tory government . 
`` The Conservatives self-evidently can not win this general election , '' he said . 
`` People who want to vote against Tony Blair for a variety of reasons can and should vote Liberal Democrat in that knowledge . 
`` Let us have no more ridiculous scare stories from Labor 's high command that voting for the Liberal Democrats will let the Conservatives in . '' 
Mr Kennedy was reacting to Mr Blair 's repeated claim - made again in an interview in the Guardian today - that people who plan to vote Liberal Democrat risk waking up to a Tory government on May 6 . 
The Liberal Democrats have published a series of newspaper adverts today claiming that they would be Britain 's most popular party if everyone who wanted to vote for them did . 
Mr Kennedy also rejected suggestions that the defection of such a long-standing leftwing critic of the government as Mr Sedgemore proved that the Liberal Democrats were now to the left of Labor . 
Disillusioned Tory and Labor voters were equally attracted to the party 's commitment to scrap university tuition fees and provide free long-term care for the elderly , he said . 
Mr Sedgemore , meanwhile , denied that he was a hard-left Labor MP of the old school , and pointed to the health secretary , John Reid , and his predecessor , Alan Milburn , as examples of politicians with Marxist baggage . 
He would not , however , elaborate on a claim he made in the Independent today that there were more Labor politicians waiting to follow him out of the party . 
`` I am not alone , '' he wrote . 
`` A small group of us - all MPs who are standing down - decided we would leave the Labor party immediately after the election . '' 
Guardian Unlimited contacted a number of retiring Labor MPs , who all denied that they were planning to leave the party after the election . 
Veteran leftwinger Tony Banks said Mr Sedgemore 's claim that there were more Labor defectors in the wings was `` the easiest claim on earth '' to make . 
`` If he has any evidence he should put it forward . 
I just think Brian was looking around for company . 
Frankly , I deeply regret what he has done . '' 
Tam Dalyell also denied planning to leave Labor , but said he wanted to see Mr Blair deposed . 
`` As far as I am concerned it is until death do us part . '' 
The Labor leader himself was circumspect about Mr Sedgemore 's defection . 
Mr Blair told reporters at Labor 's morning press conference that the election was about issues such as health , education and the economy . 
`` Let 's not allow the fate of one individual to distract us from that . '' 
Mr Blair 's predecessor as Labor leader , Lord Kinnock , was more outspoken . 
`` What I am most concerned about is the feelings that will be engendered amongst his colleagues of three or four weeks ago from the parliamentary Labor party fighting marginal seats , '' he said . 
`` For them , his statement will appear to be a lance right through the spine . '' 
"
2005-04-26,"Tuesday 26 April 2005 01.44 BST As the prime minister cleaves to the jaw-droppingly offensive premise that continued opposition to his Iraq adventure is born of his detractors having `` nothing serious to say '' , we are grateful to the brilliant internet comic strip Get Your War On , which alerts us to a tale of such powerful irony that it 's once again worth recalling why we went to war in the first place . 
Obviously , as far as terms of engagement go , international law has now been supplanted by Mr Blair 's personal reckoning of what `` the right thing to do '' is , but back then we vaguely remember some stuff about chemical weapons and , as evidence of the old boy 's willingness to use them , a load of glottal-stopped lip-quivering from the PM about what happened to the Kurds at Halabja . 
And so to one of the surest signs that this was merely what Alfred Hitchcock called a McGuffin -LRB- a plot device with no intrinsic value in itself -RRB- , with news of the fate of a coalition project , announced after Saddam 's fall in 2003 , to bring clean drinking water to Halabja 's hapless citizens . 
Specifically , it 's not happening any more . 
Well , you know how it gets . 
Security , more security - these things cost money . 
And hey : if Halabja 's residents want to raise a glass of sewage-contaminated water to their liberation , almost 50 % of them are hooked up to sporadically running supplies of it . 
Naturally , Downing Street are far too grand to bother getting back to us with a comment on the subject , so do assume the official response is along the lines of `` whatever '' . 
That said , the prime minister does allow us a glimpse into the tone of his thinking on such matters in the pages of the Daily Mirror . 
Quizzed by a reader panel on a variety of issues , Mr T is eventually forced to mention the war . 
`` And now we come to Iraq , '' he says . 
`` You know that feeling when you 're 5-0 down and your goalkeeper gets sent off ... '' Um ... kind of . 
Meanwhile , as part of our One to Watch series , we journey to Twickenham , where the Labor candidate disports himself with all the academic rigor of the attorney general . 
At last Wednesday 's public meeting , a constituent questioned Brian Whitington 's defense of the 45-minute justification by asking why we never attacked the WMD-possessing Moscow during the cold war . 
Absurd , retorted Brian - they 'd have only retaliated with WMD . 
Crystalline logic , but quite overshadowed when after the briefest of pauses he produced his trump card . 
`` But we did attack Russia , '' he explained . 
`` That 's why we backed Iraq in the war against Iran . 
Iran was supported by Russia , so by backing Saddam we were attacking Russia . '' 
Brian is challenging Lib Dem treasury spokesman Vince Cable , though evidently not in any intellectual sense . 
There is no such dumbing down in Crewe and Nantwich . 
`` While Cheshire county council is battling with a # 91m backlog of repairs , '' Tory candidate Eveleigh Moore-Dutton 's newsletter states , `` the government has seen fit to slash almost # 3m from the road maintenance fund . '' 
Perhaps it 's just us , but at this point things do seem to take a turn towards the opaque . 
`` Oratori agnascor quadrupei , '' Eveleigh goes on . 
`` Quinquennalis cathedras miscere agricolae , quamquam chirographi circumgrediet plane . '' 
But how 's it playing on the streets ? 
`` It 's very simple , '' agent Donald Potter replies briskly . 
`` It 's just a printing error . '' 
Well , one can quite see how it happened . 
Warmest congratulations , finally , to police in Sutton 's Worcester Park area , who after a four-month surveillance operation have at last amassed sufficient evidence to shut down a notorious local crack house . 
The property is located directly above Worcester Park police station , but splendid work for all that . 
"
2005-04-26,"The prime minister is a war criminal Like Chamberlain in the 30s , Blair is an appeaser of a dangerous global power . 
He should be in prison , not standing for election Tuesday 26 April 2005 01.44 BST Tony Blair has been the worst prime minister since Neville Chamberlain , a figure with whom he shares a number of significant characteristics . 
Chamberlain was a supremely confident and arrogant politician , an excellent speaker and a deeply religious man with a hotline to God . 
He had an unassailable majority in parliament , was popular in the country and presided over a cabinet stuffed with nonentities . 
Unfamiliar with the outside world , he conducted his own disastrous foreign policy with the help of backroom advisers as ignorant as himself . 
By seeking to appease the German government , the principal threat to world peace at the time , he onlysucceeded in encouraging that country 's appetite for aggression and expansionism . 
His egregious errors played a not insignificant role in the outbreak of the second world war , the principal tragedy of the 20th century . 
Blair has followed in his footsteps , and is destined for the same place in history 's hall of infamy . 
Like Chamberlain , he is an arrogant and God-fuelled appeaser , the unseemly ally of an unbridled country that presents a global threat similar to Germany in the 1930s . 
Instead of seeking a grand alliance to confront this new danger - `` a coalition of the unwilling '' that would include the Europeans , the Russians and the Chinese - Blair has sided with the evil empire . 
He has taken up a role as its principal cheerleader , obliging Britain to become a participant in its wars of aggression . 
Today 's Labor party has been a supine collaborator in this policy of appeasement , just like the Tory party in the 1930s . 
Blair 's war party must be defeated at the polls . 
The most popular slogan at the moment is `` Blair must go '' . 
This simple message echoes across the political spectrum from the Conservative party to Respect , and even into the ranks of Labor itself . 
It clearly has majority support in the country . 
Blair is a war criminal who should be locked up behind bars without a vote , not standing for election . 
Yet Labor party supporters who dislike Blair have a bitter pill to swallow . 
The entire party shares in the war guilt of its leader and his silently complicit government . 
New Labor may be self-destructing , but old Labor is in no better shape . 
It was already in a terminal state of collapse in the 1970s , as the recent obituaries of Jim Callaghan have recalled . 
The idea that a lively party exists that might rally behind Gordon Brown is a forlorn hope . 
The Labor party is a shadow of its former self , as damaged and decimated as the trade union movement , and it will have no further role to play in the 21st century . 
Given its recent record , that is an outcome to be welcomed . 
The Tories , of course , are in no better shape . 
They too are led by war criminals , caught up in supporting a war of aggression that their traditional Arabist loyalties might perhaps have led them to greet with less enthusiasm had they been in power at the time . 
Their passivity over the war has occurred against a background of wider collapse , for the Tory party , like the monarchy , the Church of England and the BBC , is in terminal decline . 
There will be no return to the automatic Tory majorities of the 20th century . 
A freak Tory victory would hardly last a twelvemonth . 
At the last election I chose the Abstention party , and it romped home to a spectacular victory . 
Many may feel disposed to support it again , since the choices on offer are so singularly unattractive . 
The degeneration of British politics and the inability of a pusillanimous generation of MPs to prevent the slide to war continue to make abstention an attractive option . 
Yet the background mood to this election , not necessarily reflected in the opinion polls , remains this deep sense of anger and resentment against the Blair government , even of disgust , and this may yet drive people to vote rather than abstain , and lead to an unusual result . 
This year , because of the serious and lasting disaffection of a large slice of the electorate that traditionally sees it as its duty to vote , there is a slim but realistic chance of a change . 
Votes cast thoughtfully rather than tribally could bring about a breakthrough that would not only destroy the Blair government but create a new political framework . 
Each individual voter must use the vote to secure an anti-war majority in parliament , and to this end it will be necessary to vote in most cases , for the Liberal Democrats and occasionally for Respect or the Greens . 
Yet no one should be ashamed of voting for Tories who voted in parliament against the war . 
Ancient animosities must be set aside , as they were in the Commons vote that brought down Chamberlain . 
The ideal outcome would be that the vagaries of the existing electoral system , which requires the selection of a local MP rather than a party leader , throws up a result in which the three main parties would each have approximately 30 % of the MPs in the new House of Commons . 
The resulting hung parliament would bring home the troops from Iraq , just as the Spanish electorate was able to do . 
It would also have a further benefit , producing fresh electoral arrangements and the possible revival of interest in politics within the parliamentary arena . 
That might be unlikely , but is the most optimistic scenario that might emerge from the current contest .

2005-04-27,"It is the duty of the young to go to the barricades for foolish causes , but today 's students would rather drink than demonstrate Wednesday 27 April 2005 01.50 BST At a recent Oxbridge dinner , I heard a college dean remark that he had taken part in two political demonstrations lately , one against the Iraq war and the other against the ban on foxhunting . 
By contrast , it was some years since his students had marched further than the pub . 
When undergraduates were told about a forthcoming rent review , college authorities awaited a howl of outrage . 
Instead , to their amazement , the proposal was received with polite acquiescence . 
This was not because the students in question are rich . 
Rather , it is because few today are willing to rouse themselves to protest about anything at all . 
Our conversation about all this seemed comic . 
Here we were , a gathering of men and women of whom few were under 40 and most a good deal more , lamenting campus tranquillity . 
It is fair to suggest that more anger was apparent at our dinner table about the shortcomings of Blair 's government , the Iraq war and WMD , than among a host of twenty-somethings in their rooms across the quad . 
Evidence suggests that this lack of student excitement is endemic , as it has been for a couple of decades . 
There are pockets of activism . 
The Iraq war prompted one huge spasm of protest in London , but this was exceptional . 
How can we be surprised that the Apathy party is likely to prevail at this general election ? 
If the best-educated section of British voters do not see any point in making a fuss , then why should millions living in relative economic contentment up and down the land ? 
Real anger today seems the privilege of a small metropolitan circle focused on the media , though characteristically many of its members kid themselves that they reflect popular views . 
I never thought I should hear myself , well , protesting , about student inertia . 
In the 1960s and thereafter , when successive generations of long-haired weirdos seemed never to leave the streets , when a banner was a more important part of a student 's equipment than his library ticket , I was a cross little Conservative . 
My kind watched in disdain as university faculty buildings were trashed , files ransacked , teachers abused . 
There seemed a silliness about many protests , which attained its nadir in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament . 
The eagerness of Foots and Benns to offer a cry of anguish against their own society as a substitute for rational thought about the threat from the Soviet Union appeared pathetic . 
Forty years on , it seems much easier than I found it then to recognize how important it is for the young to be angry about something - it does not much matter what . 
Old Jacob Bronowski , a 60s figure if ever there was one , was surely right when he wrote about university life in 1973 : `` It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin , barefoot irreverence to their studies ; they are not here to worship what is known , but to question it . '' 
This principle obviously extends beyond the lecture room , to life . 
Today , I feel a respect for the 60s protesters -LRB- if not for the decade 's violent extremists -RRB- that at the time I lacked the imagination to muster . 
True , they were often protesting for the fun of the game , rather than because they had thought coherently about the merits of the cause . 
Their enthusiasm for Mao Zedong and Ho Chi Minh -LRB- no liberal democrat , he -RRB- was absurdly naive , as even Jane Fonda concedes . 
Yet they were right that the Vietnam war was a barbaric American folly . 
It was good that they shouted slogans and asked questions , because somebody had to . 
Maybe even the CND protesters contributed something , by articulating revulsion . 
The wise men on both sides of the Atlantic knew that a nuclear conflict meant the end of civilisation , but we now know that some generals , on the American as well as the Soviet side , were occasionally tempted to think otherwise . 
All this brings us back to today 's students . 
It is said that they are too preoccupied with the struggle to prepare themselves to find jobs to have time for political frivolities . 
These are the university kids whom Camille Paglia described contemptuously as `` an army of pedestrian , toadying careerists '' . 
I do not buy this line . 
Even if a minority are working harder than we ever did , most still have plenty of leisure . 
They simply choose to spend it in different ways . 
They would rather drink than demonstrate . 
They are more passionate about sport than the fate of Iraq . 
It seems bizarre to be promoting the cause of student activism . 
Yet surely anyone who cares about British democracy should be bothered about our culture of acquiescence , not least in the re-election of a British prime minister who committed the nation to war on the basis of massive falsehoods , some of George Bush 's making but most of his own . 
Where are the Peter Hains , Jack Straws , Tariq Alis ? 
Where is the fierce , intolerant conviction that old men and women are getting it wrong , that it is time for a new generation to seize the levers ? 
The excuse will not wash that life has become so serious that , for a student , self-preservation is all . 
It seems more plausible that the young are succumbing to the material complacency that is paralysing the peoples of several western democracies , rendering them apparently unwilling to consider idealistic issues at all . 
They profess some interest in the environment . 
They want to save whales , but it is hard to imagine them renouncing the wares of Sony and Sanyo in the cause , as the Hains renounced apartheid sherry . 
They are dismayed by horrors in Africa , but would rather spend Saturday afternoon watching Man U than demonstrating outside Downing Street about western supineness . 
They shrug : what difference can we make ? 
Yet the young are supposed to cherish vain hopes and go to the barricades for foolish causes . 
A world in which a college dean protests while his students swot in their rooms or head for the pub is topsy-turvy indeed . 
It does not matter what they protest about , if they will only bestir themselves to become agitated about something . 
They might even demonstrate against Peter Hain . 
"
2005-04-27,"What was the legal advice ? 
Three days before the first US missiles hit Baghdad , Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , answered a question in the Lords on the legal basis for the use of military force . 
In nine short paragraphs he set out his reasoning : that even without the `` second resolution '' UK diplomats had been frantically trying to secure , existing UN resolutions permitted an invasion . 
His argument was that the security council 's authorisation for the 1991 Gulf war -LRB- resolution 678 -RRB- could be reactivated if Iraq were found to be in material breach of its ceasefire conditions -LRB- resolution 687 -RRB- . 
Since resolution 1441 , unanimously passed the previous November , stated that Iraq had not `` fully complied with its obligations to disarm '' , the authority to use force was automatically revived , Lord Goldsmith wrote . 
His view was that if the resolution demanded another meeting of the security council to authorise war it would have said so . 
All 1441 required , he wrote , was `` discussion by the security council of the Iraq 's failures '' . 
Key UN personnel including Kofi Annan , the secretary general , and Hans Blix , the chief weapons inspector , later disputed the legal status of the invasion under international law . 
Plenty of international lawyers also disagree with the reasoning of Lord Goldsmith 's nine paragraphs . 
Tony Blair , the prime minister , insists the written answer of March 17 was a `` fair summary '' of the advice he was given and Lord Goldsmith said it was `` consistent '' with the longer document . 
But leaked documents and disclosures suggest the full 13 pages Lord Goldsmith wrote for the prime minister 10 days before were more ambiguous . 
A summary of the advice , obtained by the Guardian and Channel 4 News , said resolution 1441 was `` capable in principle '' of reauthorising 678 -LRB- the gist of his written answer -RRB- but it added two qualifications omitted on March 17 . 
First , that the language of 1441 suggests `` differences of view within the -LRB- security -RRB- council '' on the legal impact of 1441 so the safest legal course would be to secure a second resolution . 
Second , that the eventual argument he did deploy - the reactivation of 678 - would only be `` sustainable if there are strong factual grounds for concluding Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity '' to comply with the Gulf war ceasefire . 
`` In other words , '' read the summary of Lord Goldsmith 's advice to the prime minister , `` we would need to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-cooperation . 
Given the structure of the resolution as a whole , the views of Unmovic and the IAEA -LRB- the two UN weapons inspections authorities -RRB- will be highly significant in this respect . '' 
What were the views of the weapons inspectors ? 
Hans Blix , the head of Unmovic , moved to the opinion that Iraq was beginning to comply with 1441 's call for it demonstrate it had disarmed . 
On February 14 2003 he delivered a report to the security council listing examples of Iraqi compliance and questioning some of the US intelligence behind Colin Powell UN presentation on Saddam Hussein 's weapons programs . 
He followed up on February 28 with a more mixed assessment but marked out Iraq 's commitment to comply with a deadline to destroy its illegal Samoud 2 missiles as a positive development . 
The Swede 's final report to the council , delivered on March 7 , was also ambivalent but Mr Blix stressed the disarmament under way : `` We are not watching the destruction of toothpicks , '' he told the security council . 
Mr Blix 's reports divided security council opinion . 
March 7 , the day Lord Goldsmith suggested a second resolution to authorise force would offer the `` safest legal course '' and the day of the final Unmovic report , was the day this second resolution became increasingly unlikely . 
Jack Straw , the foreign secretary , proposed the UN set an ultimatum for Iraq to demonstrate `` full , unconditional , immediate and active cooperation '' by March 17 , but France made it clear it would veto such a resolution . 
Britain then proposed setting `` six tests '' for Iraq to meet if it was to avoid war . 
The idea galvanised some diplomatic support but not enough to suggest Britain and the US could win a second resolution . 
On March 12 , with the hope of a such a resolution fading , Admiral Sir Michael Boyce , chief of defense staff , asked the prime minister for an unequivocal statement on the legality of war under resolution 1441 . 
The next day , Lord Goldsmith saw Lord Falconer and Baroness Morgan , two of Mr Blair 's closest advisers , at an unminuted Downing Street meeting , and expressed his `` clear view '' that war would be lawful under 1441 . 
Did Lord Goldsmith change his mind ? 
Previous disclosures suggest he did . 
Elizabeth Wilmshurst , deputy legal adviser to the Foreign Office , resigned in March 2003 because she did not believe war with Iraq was legal . 
Her letter setting out why said Lord Goldsmith `` gave us to understand '' he agreed with Foreign Office lawyers that the war was illegal without a new UN resolution but changed his advice twice just before the war to bring it in line with `` what is now the official line '' . 
The summary certainly reveals doubts . 
The attorney general says in conclusion that he could not be sure that if the `` reasonable case '' for reactivating 678 -LRB- the case that became the nine published paragraphs -RRB- ever came to court `` the court would agree with the view '' . 
This detail - and the reference that the published argument was one he heard in Washington - appear to make for a tricky week ahead for the prime minister .

2005-04-27,"Wednesday 27 April 2005 16.50 BST Private Johnson Beharry after receiving his Victoria Cross for his deeds in Iraq . 
Photograph : Fiona Hanson\/PA The Iraq war hero Johnson Beharry , who twice saved the crew of his armored vehicle from ambushes , received the Victoria Cross today and was told by the Queen : `` You 're very special . '' 
Private Beharry , 25 , who is originally from the Caribbean island of Grenada , is the first person to receive Britain 's highest military honor since the Falklands war in 1982 and the first living recipient of a VC since 1965 . 
It is thought that his actions in Iraq saved the lives of more than 30 of his colleagues . 
Speaking today after receiving the medal at a ceremony at Buckingham Palace , Pte Beharry , of the Princess of Wales 's Royal Regiment , said the Queen had told him that `` she does n't get to present the VC very often '' . 
Pte Beharry , from Tidworth , Hampshire , was struck by a bullet as he guided a Warrior armored convoy through the flashpoint Iraqi town of Al-Amara last May . 
He jumped into a hail of bullets three times to rescue injured colleagues before driving his vehicle to safety . 
A month later , he saved more lives during another ferocious fire fight and suffered serious head injuries when a rocket-propelled grenade -LRB- RPG -RRB- exploded a foot away from his head . 
As blood poured into his eyes , he managed to reverse his Warrior out of the ambush before he lost consciousness and went into a coma . 
Still recovering from his wounds and bearing a scar across his forehead , he said today : `` I know I 'm lucky to be alive . 
Every day in Iraq , when I went out on patrol , I thought I would n't be coming back - then at the end of the day I thought , ` That was a lucky one . ' '' 
The citation for his VC reads : `` For his repeated extreme gallantry and unquestioned valor , despite intense direct attacks , personal injury and damage to his vehicle in the face of relentless enemy action , Pte Beharry deserves the highest possible recognition . '' 
But Pte Beharry , who was accompanied to the palace by his wife , Lynthia , and his aunt Irene and uncle Raymond , played down his bravery . 
`` When I hear what I did , I ca n't really believe it was me . 
But what I did was my choice - I knew I had to get everyone out because I would n't have been able to live with myself otherwise . 
I think it 's the training that just kicks in , '' he said . 
He said celebrations had been put on hold during his recovery . 
`` There 's too much happening at the moment , '' he said . 
`` I never dreamt this would happen to me ; I never thought I 'd meet so many important people . 
`` I 'm still receiving treatment for my injuries - I 'm getting physio and seeing specialists - so I 'm limited in what I can do . 
I hope to return to service but I do n't know when that will be and I would go back to Iraq if I had to . '' 
Pte Beharry was joined at today 's ceremony by around 140 other British troops awarded honors for their service around the world . 
His commanding officers , Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Maer and Major James Coote , received the Distinguished Service Order for their leadership during the campaign . 
`` Pte Beharry 's actions were superb , '' said Lt Col Maer . 
`` The VC is hard won and he is following in a long and distinguished line of people awarded the honor . 
All of us , in the army and the nation , should be proud of him . 
And we should be proud of all the other recipients of honors won in Iraq - they reflect a team effort . '' 
Pte Beharry moved to the UK from Grenada in 1999 and worked as a painter and decorator before becoming a British soldier in 2001 . 
He is one of a growing number of troops recruited into the army from the Commonwealth . 
He is the first to be awarded the VC since Lieutenant Colonel H Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay received posthumous awards after the Falklands war against Argentina . 
Today Pte Beharry outranked Britain 's top soldier , General Sir Michael Jackson , for the day . 
The junior soldier 's investiture took precedence to the general 's who received the honor of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath . 
When news of Pte Beharry 's VC was announced in March , Sir Michael said he had never felt more proud of the British army . 
Meanwhile , Ellen MacArthur , who broke the record for sailing solo around the world in February , became Dame Ellen . 
At 28 , the yachtswoman is the youngest person to receive the honor . 
Actress Anna Massey collected a CBE - invested as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire - for services to drama .

2005-04-27,"Wednesday 27 April 2005 07.20 BST The Gulf state of Qatar is considering privatising its satellite TV channel , al-Jazeera , because of pressure from the US and a de facto advertising boycott by Arab countries offended by its critical coverage . 
Reporters at the station fear that if the channel is privatised commercial pressures could force it to tone down its coverage . 
Al-Jazeera 's coverage of politics has embroiled Qatar in disputes with almost all of its neighbors , including Saudi Arabia and Iran . 
According to Wadah Khanfar , the station 's director , the consultancy firm Ernst and Young has been hired to look into possible privatisation models , though he said no final decision had yet been taken . 
Reporters fear that the power of advertisers and shareholders could lead to self-censorship if the channel is privatised . 
Because of its taboo-breaking coverage al-Jazeera has an audience of some 35-40 million but attracts few advertisers . 
Saudi Arabia leads the de facto advert boycott , which al-Jazeera 's head of business news , Ahmed Abdul Mohsen al-Qady , described as `` the only thing the Arab information ministers can all agree on '' . 
In the absence of ad revenues a government subsidy keeps the station afloat . 
It is also feared that powerful Saudis would buy the station if shares were floated on Qatar 's stock market . 
The pan-Arab satellite station , founded in 1996 , helped to start the Arab world 's media revolution . 
Along with the internet , satellite television means autocracies can no longer monopolise the flow of information . 
A viewer in neighbouring Bahrain said : `` A critical station is something completely new in this region . 
We have never before had a TV program or a newspaper that criticises the government . '' 
Qatar is unapologetically pro-US , which is unusual in a region where rulers often denounce Washington to domestic audiences . 
It hosted US forces during the Iraq war . 
But Washington objects to some of al-Jazeera 's coverage , including that of al-Qaida , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and Iraq . 
Hans Wechsel , regional director of the US state department 's Middle East partnership initiative , said : `` We have issues with them giving a platform to people who are calling for violence . 
It 's not a matter of government interference , it 's strictly an issue of ethics . 
After all , we raise ethical concerns with journalists in the US too . '' 
But Hafez al-Mirazi , an Egyptian who runs the channel 's Washington bureau , said : `` The US must know that the country hosting their airbase is not funding al-Qaida . 
They just have a problem with us showing any civilian casualties in Iraq . '' 
Mr Mirazi , who previously worked for Voice Of America , added : `` The White House has been spoilt by Fox News . 
The current administration is unusually sensitive to any criticism . 
The situation now is ` either you 're just like Fox , or you 're against us ' . '' 
Some say the station represents a big step forward for Arab democracy , which Washington advocates . 
Mouafac Harb , director of al-Jazeera 's less popular US-funded rival , al-Hurra , said : `` Al-Jazeera has hijacked the role of the mosque as the primary source of information and views . 
Al-Jazeera is the only political process in the Middle East . '' 
In a region where there is intense anti-US sentiment a private-sector al-Jazeera could well be more critical of the superpower . 
At present the station invites US officials to put forward their point of view . 
Hugh Miles , the author of Al-Jazeera : How Arab TV News Challenged The World , said : `` They have shown five hours of bin Laden 's speeches in total - and 500 hours of Bush . '' 
Qatar , a tiny emirate whose population is 700,000 , was a minnow in regional politics until it discovered it was sitting on the world 's third-biggest gas reserves . 
Now the country is punching above its weight in Arab politics . 
`` Al-Jazeera put this country on the map , '' said Mr Qady , speaking in the Qatari capital of Doha . 
`` Who had heard of Qatar before ? ''

2005-04-27,"Conservative party co-chairman , Liam Fox , and shadow chief secretary to the treasury , George Osborne , unveil the latest Conservative campaign poster . 
Photograph : Daniel Berehulak\/Getty Michael Howard yesterday paved the way for a bitter end to the general election when the Tories launched a nationwide poster campaign explicitly condemning Tony Blair as a liar . 
In an echo of the Conservatives ' notorious `` demon eyes '' of 1997 , the leadership unveiled a poster of a shifty-looking Mr Blair standing next to a stark message . 
`` If he 's prepared to lie to take us to war , he 's prepared to lie to win an election , '' it says in black lettering on a dark red background . 
In a play on Labor 's latest message imploring people to vote for what they value , it adds : `` If you value the truth , vote for it . '' 
Mr Howard was last night unapologetic about the poster , which includes language that would be ruled out of order in the House of Commons . 
`` I 'm a very direct person . 
I say it as it is , '' he said during a visit to Birmingham . 
`` Character is an issue at this election . 
It is about trust . '' 
At his morning press conference , Mr Howard defended his decision to describe the prime minister as a liar for three reasons : The so called `` dodgy dossier '' of February 2003 , which the prime minister claimed was based on intelligence but was in fact `` pulled off '' the internet ; The prime minister 's claim in September 2002 that intelligence about Iraqi weapons of mass destruction was `` extensive , detailed and authoritative '' when Lord Butler depicted it in his report last year as `` limited , sporadic and patchy '' ; The prime minister and Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , had `` directly contradicted each other '' about advice on the legality of the Iraq war . 
The poster is a gamble for Mr Howard - on the day after he admitted he was `` two goals down '' - because he was such an enthusiastic supporter of military action . 
But he believes that voters across the spectrum , including opponents and supporters of the war , will share his belief that Iraq highlighted wider questions about the prime minister 's trustworthiness . 
One aide said : `` Trust really is the fundamental issue . 
War is the lightning conductor but he lied on top-up fees . 
So Michael is saying you ca n't trust Labor on tax - because of the 66 stealth taxes - and you ca n't trust him on health because he said in 1997 there was 24 hours to save the NHS . 
Can you trust anyone who says that and then fails to deliver ? '' 
Labor will have mixed feelings about the poster because the prime minister needs no reminding that anger about Iraq has made him one of the party 's main liabilities . 
But Labor strategists believe the Tories ' decision to attack him in such personal terms shows Mr Howard `` has nothing to say '' about the voters ' main concerns on schools and hospitals . 
In a sign that the Tories are embarking on a negative end to the campaign , one of Australia 's toughest political operators has flown in to help the party . 
Mark Textor , who has allegedly deployed the US tactic of `` push polling '' to spread damaging information about opponents under the guise of questions , was photographed by the Labor party entering Tory HQ . 
The Conservatives said they had never hidden the fact that Mr Textor , a business partner of the party 's Australian campaign director , Lynton Crosby , would help out .

2005-04-27,"Ruined , cordoned Falluja is emerging as the decade 's monument to brutality Wednesday 27 April 2005 17.57 BST Robert Zoellick is the archetypal US government insider , a man with a brilliant technical mind but zero experience of any coalface or war front . 
Sliding effortlessly between ivy league academia , the US treasury and corporate boardrooms -LRB- including an advisory post with the scandalous Enron -RRB- , his latest position is the number-two slot at the state department . 
Yet this ultimate `` man of the suites '' did something earlier this month that put the prime minister and the foreign secretary to shame . 
On their numerous visits to Iraq , neither has ever dared to go outside the heavily fortified green zones of Baghdad and Basra to see life as Iraqis have to live it . 
They come home after photo opportunities , briefings and pep talks with British troops and claim to know what is going on in the country they invaded , when in fact they have seen almost nothing . 
Zoellick , by contrast , on his first trip to Iraq , asked to see Falluja . 
A city of some 300,000 , which was alleged to be the stronghold of armed resistance to the occupation . 
Two US attempts were made to destroy this symbol of defiance last year . 
The first , in April , fizzled out after Iraqi politicians , including many who supported the invasion of their country , condemned the use of air strikes to terrorise an entire city . 
The Americans called off the attack , but not before hundreds of families had fled and more than 600 people had been killed . 
Six months later the Americans tried again . 
This time Washington 's allies had been talked to in advance . 
Consistent US propaganda about the presence in Falluja of a top al-Qaida figure , Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , was used to create a climate of acquiescence in the US-appointed Iraqi government . 
Shia leaders were told that bringing Falluja under control was the only way to prevent a Sunni-inspired civil war . 
Blair was invited to share responsibility by sending British troops to block escape routes from Falluja and prevent supplies entering once the siege began . 
Warnings of the onslaught prompted the vast majority of Falluja 's 300,000 people to flee . 
The city was then declared a free-fire zone on the grounds that the only people left behind must be `` terrorists '' . 
Three weeks after the attack was launched last November , the Americans claimed victory . 
They say they killed about 1,300 people ; one week into the siege , a BBC reporter put the unofficial death toll at 2,000 . 
But details of what happened and who the dead were remain obscure . 
Were many unarmed civilians , as Baghdad-based human rights groups report ? 
Even if they were trying to defend their homes by fighting the Americans , does that make them `` terrorists '' ? 
Journalists `` embedded '' with US forces filmed atrocities , including the killing of a wounded prisoner , but no reporter could get anything like a full picture . 
Since the siege ended , tight US restric tions - as well as the danger of hostage-taking that prevents reporters from traveling in most parts of Iraq - have put the devastated city virtually off limits . 
In this context Zoellick 's trip , which was covered by a small group of US journalists , was illuminating . 
The deputy secretary of state had to travel to this `` liberated '' city in a Black Hawk helicopter flying low over palm trees to avoid being shot down . 
He wore a flak jacket under his suit even though Falluja 's streets were largely deserted . 
His convoy of eight armored vehicles went `` so quickly past an open-air bakery reopened with a US-provided micro-loan that workers tossing dough could be glanced only in the blink of an eye , '' as the Washington Post reported . 
`` Blasted husks of buildings still line block after block , '' the journalist added . 
Meeting hand-picked Iraqis in a US base , Zoellick was bombarded with complaints about the pace of US reconstruction aid and frequent intimidation of citizens by American soldiers . 
Although a state department factsheet claimed 95 % of residents had water in their homes , Falluja 's mayor said it was contaminated by sewage and unsafe . 
Other glimpses of life in Falluja come from Dr Hafid al-Dulaimi , head of the city 's compensation commission , who reports that 36,000 homes were destroyed in the US onslaught , along with 8,400 shops . 
Sixty nurseries and schools were ruined , along with 65 mosques and religious sanctuaries . 
Daud Salman , an Iraqi journalist with the Institute for War and Peace Reporting , on a visit to Falluja two weeks ago , found that only a quarter of the city 's residents had gone back . 
Thousands remain in tents on the outskirts . 
The Iraqi Red Crescent finds it hard to go in to help the sick because of the US cordon around the city . 
Burhan Fasa'a , a cameraman for the Lebanese Broadcasting Company , reported during the siege that dead family members were buried in their gardens because people could not leave their homes . 
Refugees told one of us that civilians carrying white flags were gunned down by American soldiers . 
Corpses were tied to US tanks and paraded around like trophies . 
Justin Alexander , a volunteer for Christian Peacemaker Teams , recently found hundreds living in tents in the grounds of their homes , or in a single patched-up room . 
A strict system of identity cards blocks access to anyone whose papers give a birthplace outside Falluja , so long-term residents born elsewhere can not go home . 
`` Fallujans feel the remnants of their city have been turned into a giant prison , '' he reports . 
Many complain that soldiers of the Iraqi national guard , the fledgling new army , loot shops during the night-time curfew and detain people in order to take a bribe for their release . 
They are suspected of being members of the Badr Brigade , a Shia militia that wants revenge against Sunnis . 
One thing is certain : the attack on Falluja has done nothing to still the insurgency against the US-British occupation nor produced the death of al-Zarqawi - any more than the invasion of Afghanistan achieved the capture or death of Osama bin Laden . 
Thousands of bereaved and homeless Falluja families have a new reason to hate the US and its allies . 
At least Zoellick went to see . 
He gave no hint of the impression that the trip left him with , but is too smart not to have understood something of the reality . 
The lesson ought not to be lost on Blair and Straw . 
Every time the prime minister claims it is time to `` move on '' from the issue of the war 's legality and rejoice at Iraq 's transformation since Saddam Hussein was toppled , the answer must be : `` Remember Falluja . '' 
When the foreign secretary next visits Iraq , he should put on a flak jacket and tour the city that Britain had a share in destroying . 
The government keeps hoping Iraq will go away as an election issue . 
It stubbornly refuses to do so . 
Voters are not only angry that the war was illegal , illegitimate and unnecessary . 
The treatment inflicted on Iraqis since the invasion by the US and Britain is equally important . 
In the 1930s the Spanish city of Guernica became a symbol of wanton murder and destruction . 
In the 1990s Grozny was cruelly flattened by the Russians ; it still lies in ruins . 
This decade 's unforgettable monument to brutality and overkill is Falluja , a text-book case of how not to handle an insurgency , and a reminder that unpopular occupations will always degenerate into desperation and atrocity .

2005-04-28,"Attorney general feared court challenge Weapons evidence was crucial Thursday 28 April 2005 12.48 BST Tony Blair was told by the government 's most senior law officer in a confidential minute less than two weeks before the war that British participation in the American-led invasion of Iraq could be declared illegal . 
In a legal opinion Mr Blair has repeatedly refused to publish and never seen by the cabinet , Lord Goldsmith , the attorney general , spelled out the dangers of going to war , including the prospect of Britain losing a case in an international court . 
He warned that while he could argue a `` reasonable case '' in favor of military action , he was not confident a court would agree . 
Indeed , a court `` might well conclude '' that a new UN resolution was needed before military action could be undertaken . 
The attorney general warned Mr Blair that Britain might be able to argue it could go to war on the basis of past UN resolutions , but only if there were `` strong factual grounds '' that Iraq was still in breach of its disarmament obligations . 
Lord Goldsmith 's 13-page minute was sent to Mr Blair on March 7 2003 . 
On that day , Hans Blix , the chief UN weapons inspector , declared that Iraq had made `` substantial '' progress in destroying its long-range missiles , and he had found no evidence of biological or chemical weapons . 
The fact that Lord Goldsmith 's legal opinion was not seen by the cabinet is an apparent breach of the official code covering ministerial behavior . 
It is in contrast to the parliamentary answer issued by Lord Goldsmith 10 days later , which was shown to the cabinet . 
In his answer , which contained none of the earlier caveats , he said it was `` plain '' that Iraq was in breach of its UN disarmament obligations . 
Lord Goldsmith last night said he stood by his opinion that it was legal for Britain to go to war in Iraq . 
The document `` stood up '' the govern ment 's case that he had not changed his opinion between giving Mr Blair private advice on March 7 and his statement to parliament . 
In a statement , he said the document showed how he had gone through the complex arguments over the legality of military action before concluding that it would be lawful . 
`` The document ... so far from standing up the case of the government 's critics , stands up the case the government has been making all along . 
`` Contrary to the allegations that have persistently been made , it does not say the war was unlawful but confirms the conclusion I reached was that a sufficient basis for the use of force was established without a second resolution . '' 
In 2003 , Lord Goldsmith asked Downing Street for Mr Blair 's view . 
No 10 replied that it was `` indeed , the prime minister 's unequivocal view '' that Iraq was still in breach . 
But , according to extracts from his confidential minute of March 7 , the attorney general warned Mr Blair : `` The language of resolution 1441 -LRB- the last UN resolution on Iraq before the war -RRB- leaves the position unclear '' ; `` I remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force '' ; `` We would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of -LRB- Iraqi -RRB- non-compliance and non-cooperation '' ; `` In the light of the latest reporting by Unmovic -LRB- UN weapons inspectors -RRB- you will need to consider very carefully whether the evidence of non-cooperation and non-compliance by Iraq is sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity '' . 
According to the Butler report on the use of intelligence in the run-up to war , ministers failed to ask Britain 's intelligence agencies to look again at their assessments of Iraq 's weapons program despite the UN inspectors ' failure to find any . 
In his minute , Lord Goldsmith revealed that his predecessors had advised that the legality of British bombing of Iraq in Operation Desert Fox in 1998 , and of Kosovo the following year , was `` no more than reasonably arguable '' . 
In a pointed warning to the prime minister , he added : `` But a ` reasonable case ' does not mean that if the matter ever came before a court I would be confident that the court would agree with the view . '' 
A court `` might well conclude '' , Lord Goldsmith said , that the wording of resolution 1441 required a second resolution to trigger military action . 
A `` counter view '' could be reasonably maintained , Lord Goldsmith said . 
`` However , it must be recognized that on previous occasions when military action was taken on the basis of a reasonably arguable case , the degree of public and parliamentary scrutiny of the legal issue was nothing as great as it is today . '' 
He also dismissed the government 's claim that by threatening to veto a new UN resolution France was behaving unreasonably , and this somehow negated the need for a new resolution : `` As I have said before , I do not believe that there is any basis in law for arguing that there is an implied condition of reason ableness which can be read into the power of veto conferred on the permanent members of the security council by the UN charter . '' 
`` In any event , '' he added , `` if the majority of world opinion remains opposed to military action , it is likely to be difficult on the facts to categorise a French veto as ` unreasonable ' . '' 
The disclosure of extracts was seized on last night by constitutional experts as well as opposition politicians . 
Anthony Lester QC , a Liberal Democrat peer , described it as a `` devastating blow to the government 's credibility '' . 
Peter Hennessy , a professor of political history at London University , said : `` The whole thing reeks . 
Even if the prime minister wins handsomely on polling day this will stain him and his premiership as long as people remember it , just as Anthony Eden 's name isforever associated with the Suez crisis . '' 
The Liberal Democrat leader , Charles Kennedy , said : `` What is abundantly clear is not only that the prime minister made the wrong political judgment but he went about justifying that judgment in a seriously misleading way . '' 
"
2005-04-28,"Full text : Iraq legal advice -LRB- part two -RRB- The full text of the advice about the legality of war with Iraq given by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , to the prime minister , Tony Blair , on March 7 2003 . 
Read the first part of the advice Thursday 28 April 2005 18.46 BST 20 . 
It has also been suggested that the final words of OP4 were chosen carefully to avoid the implication that it was for the Security Council to assess whether Iraqi conduct constituted a further material breach . 
The French proposed to amend OP4 so that Iraqi conduct would only amount to a further material breach `` when assessed '' as such by the Council , but this amendment was not accepted . 
I am not wholly convinced by this argument : if , for the reasons discussed in paragraph 17 above , OP4 requires an assessment of Iraq 's conduct by the Council , the alternative language makes little difference . 
However , I do accept that the negotiating history indicates that the words at the end of OP4 `` and shall be reported to the Council for assessment in accordance with paragraphs 11 and 12 '' were added at a late stage , but in substitution for other language which would clearly have had the effect of making any finding of further material breach subject to a further Council decision . 
Whether a report comes to the Council under OP4 or OP11 , the critical issue is what action the Council is required to take at that point . 
In other words , what does OP12 require . 
It is clear that the language of OP12 was a compromise by the US from their starting position that the Council should authorise in advance the use of all necessary means to enforce the ceasefire resolution in the event of continued violations by Iraq . 
It is equally clear , however , that the language does not expressly provide that a further Council decision is necessary to authorise the use of force . 
The paragraph indicates that in the event of a report of a further material breach -LRB- whether under OP4 or OP11 -RRB- there will be a meeting of the Council to consider the situation and the need for compliance in order to secure international peace and security . 
The Council thus has the opportunity to take a further decision expressly authorising the use of force or , conceivably , to decide that other enforcement means should be used . 
But the Council might fail to act . 
The resolution does not state what is to happen in those circumstances . 
The clear US view is that , whatever the reason for the Council 's failure to act , the determination of material breach in OPs 1 and 4 would remain valid , thus authorising the use of force without a further decision . 
My view is that different considerations apply in different circumstances . 
The OP12 discussion might make clear that the Council 's view is that military action is appropriate but that no further decision is required because of the terms of resolution 1441 . 
In such a case , there would be good grounds for relying on the existing resolution as the legal basis for any subsequent military action . 
The more difficult scenario is if the views of Council members are divided and a further resolution is not adopted either because it fails to attract 9 votes or because it is vetoed . 
The principal argument in favor of the view that no further decision is required to authorise force in these circumstances is that the language of OP12 -LRB- ie `` consider '' -RRB- was chosen deliberately to indicate the need for a further discussion , but not a decision . 
As I have indicated , it is contended that this interpretation is supported by the negotiating history . 
The French and Russians both made proposals to amend OP12 to include an express requirement for a further decision , but these proposals were not accepted . 
The US Administration insist that they made clear throughout that they would not accept a text which subjected the use of force to a further Council decision . 
The French -LRB- and others -RRB- therefore knew what they were voting for . 
The US are confident that in accepting OPs 4 and 12 , they were conceding a Council discussion and no more . 
The US , of course , approached the negotiation of resolution 1441 from a different starting point because , as I explained in paragraph 9 above , they have always taken the view that `` material breach '' is a matter of objective fact and does not require a Security Council determination . 
-LRB- By contrast , the UK position taken on the advice of successive Law Officers , has been that it is for the Security Council to determine the existence of a material breach of the ceasefire . -RRB- 
Therefore , while the US objective was to ensure that the resolution did not constrain the right of action which they believed they already had , our objective was to secure a sufficient authorisation from the Council in the absence of which we would have had no right to act . 
I have considered whether this difference in the underlying legal view means that the effect of the resolution might be different for the US than for the UK , but I have concluded that it does not affect the position . 
If OP12 of the resolution , properly interpreted , were to mean that a further Council decision was required before force was authorised , this would constrain the US just as much as the UK . 
It was therefore an essential negotiating point for the US that the resolution should not concede the need for a second resolution . 
They are convinced that they succeeded . 
I was impressed by the strength and sincerity of the views of the US Administration which I heard in Washington on this point . 
However , the difficulty is that we are reliant on their assertions for the view that the French -LRB- and others -RRB- knew and accepted that they were voting for a further discussion and no more . 
We have very little hard evidence of this beyond a couple of telegrams recording admissions by French negotiators that they knew the US would not accept a resolution which required a further Council decision . 
The possibility remains that the French and others accepted OP12 because in their view it gave them a sufficient basis on which to argue that a second resolution was required -LRB- even if that was not made expressly clear -RRB- . 
A further difficulty is that , if the matter ever came before a court , it is very uncertain to what extent the court would accept evidence of the negotiating history to support a particular interpretation of the resolution , given that most of the negotiations were conducted in private and there are no agreed or official records . 
The counter view of OP12 is that this paragraph must imply a decision by the Council . 
Three particular arguments support that approach : -LRB- i -RRB- when taken with the word `` assessment '' in OP4 , the language of OP12 indicates that the Council will be assessing the seriousness of any Iraqi breach ; this is especially powerful if in truth some assessment is necessary ; -LRB- ii -RRB- there is a special significance in the words `` in order to secure international peace and security '' . 
They reflect not only the special responsibility of the Security Council under Article 39 of the UN Charter -LRB- `` The Security Council shall determine the existence of any threat to the peace , breach of the peace , or acts of aggression and shall make recommendations , or decide what measures shall be taken ... to maintain or restore international peace and security '' -RRB- , but also pick up the language of both resolution 678 -LRB- which authorised the use of force `` to restore international peace and security in the area '' -RRB- and resolution 687 -LRB- which referred to the objective of `` restoring international peace and security in the area as set out in its recent resolutions '' -RRB- . 
The clear inference , it will be argued , is that this shows the Council was to exercise a deliberative role on that issue , ie to determine what it is necessary to secure international peace and security ; -LRB- iii -RRB- any other construction reduces the role of the Council discussion under OP12 to a procedural formality . 
Others have jibbed at this categorisation , but I remain of the opinion that this would be the effect in legal terms of the view that no further resolution is required . 
The Council would be required to meet , and all members of the Council would be under an obligation to participate in the discussion in good faith , but even if an overwhelming majority of the Council were opposed to the use of force , military action could proceed regardless . 
Where the meaning of a resolution is unclear from the text , the statements made by members of the Council at the time of its adoption may be taken into account in order to ascertain the Council 's intentions . 
The statements made during the debate on 8 November 2002 are not , however , conclusive . 
The US and UK stated that further breaches would be reported to the Council `` for discussion '' . 
Jeremy Greenstock then added that we would then expect the Council to `` meet its responsibilities '' , although -LRB- implicitly -RRB- we would be prepared to act without Council backing to ensure that the task of disarmament is completed . 
Only the US explicitly stated that it believed that the resolution did not constrain the use of force by States `` to enforce relevant United Nations resolutions and protect world peace and security '' regardless of whether there was a further Council decision . 
Conversely , two other Council members , Mexico and Ireland , made clear that in their view a further decision of the Council was required before the use of force would be authorised . 
Syria also stated that `` the resolution should not be interpreted , through certain paragraphs , as authorising any State to use force '' . 
Most other Council members were less clear in their comments . 
The joint statement of France , Russia and China is somewhat opaque , but seems to imply that a further decision is required . 
Many delegations welcomed the fact that there was `` no automaticity '' in the resolution with regard to the use of force . 
But it is not clear what they meant by this . 
It could indicate that they did not consider that the resolution authorised the use of force in any circumstances by means of the revival argument . 
On the other hand there is some evidence from the negotiating history that their main concern was that the resolution should not authorise force immediately following its adoption -LRB- last four words underlined -RRB- on the basis of `` material breach '' in OP1 plus `` serious consequences '' in OP13 . 
The UK and US indicated that `` no automaticity '' meant that there would be a Council discussion before force was used . 
To sum up , the language of resolution 1441 leaves the position unclear and the statements made on adoption of the resolution suggest that there were differences of view within the Council as to the legal effect of the resolution . 
Arguments can be made on both sides . 
A key question is whether there is in truth a need for an assessment of whether Iraq 's conduct constitutes a failure to take the final opportunity or has constituted a failure fully to cooperate within the meaning of OP4 such that the basis of the ceasefire is destroyed . 
If an assessment is needed of that sort , it would be for the Council to make it . 
A narrow textual reading of the resolution suggests that sort of assessment is not needed , because the Council has pre-determined the issue . 
Public statements , on the other hand , say otherwise . 
In these circumstances , I remain of the opinion that the safest legal course would be to secure the adoption of a further resolution to authorise the use of force . 
I have already advised that I do not believe that such a resolution need be explicit in its terms . 
The key point is that it should establish that the Council has conduced that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity offered by resolution 1441 , as in the draft which has already been tabled . 
Nevertheless , having regard to the information on the negotiating history which I have been given and to the arguments of the US Administration which I heard in Washington , I accept that a reasonable case can be made that resolution 1441 is capable in principle of reviving the authorisation in 678 without a further resolution . 
However , the argument that resolution 1441 alone has revived the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 will only be sustainable if there are strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity . 
In other words , we would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-cooperation . 
Given the structure of the resolution as a whole , the views of UNMOVIC and the IAEA will be highly significant in this respect . 
In the light of the latest reporting by UNMOVIC , you will need to consider extremely carefully whether the evidence of non-cooperation and non-compliance by Iraq is sufficiently compelling to justify the conclusion that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity . 
In reaching my conclusions , I have taken account of the fact that on a number of previous occasions , including in relation to Operation Desert Fox in December 1998 and Kosovo in 1999 , UK forces have participated in military action on the basis of advice from my predecessors that the legality of the action under international law was no more than reasonably arguable . 
But a `` reasonable case '' does not mean that if the matter ever came before a court I would be confident that the court would agree with this view . 
I judge that , having regard to the arguments on both sides , and considering the resolution as a whole in the light of the statements made on adoption and subsequently , a court might well conclude that OPs 4 and 12 do require a further Council decision in order to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 . 
But equally I consider that the counter view can be reasonably maintained . 
However , it must be recognized that on previous occasions when military action was taken on the basis of a reasonably arguable case , the degree of public and Parliamentary scrutiny of the legal issue was nothing like as great as it is today . 
The analysis set out above applies whether a second resolution fails to be adopted because of a lack of votes or because it is vetoed . 
As I have said before , I do not believe that there is any basis in law for arguing that there is an implied condition of reasonableness which can be read into the power of veto conferred on the permanent members of the Security Council by the UN Charter . 
So there are no grounds for arguing that an `` unreasonable veto '' would entitle us to proceed on the basis of a presumed Security Council authorisation . 
In any event , if the majority of world opinion remains opposed to military action , it is likely to be difficult on the facts to categorise a French veto as `` unreasonable '' . 
The legal analysis may , however , be affected by the course of events over the next week or so , e.g. the discussions on the draft second resolution . 
If we fail to achieve the adoption of a second resolution , we would need to consider urgently at that stage the strength of our legal case in the light of circumstances at that time . 
Possible consequences of acting without a second resolution 32 . 
In assessing the risks of acting on the basis of a reasonably arguable case , you will wish to take account of the ways in which the matter might be brought before a court . 
There are a number of possibilities . 
First , the General Assembly could request an advisory opinion on the legality of the military action from the International Court of Justice -LRB- ICJ -RRB- . 
A request for such an opinion could be made at the request of a simple majority of the States within the GA , so the UK and US could not block such action . 
Second , given that the United Kingdom has accepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the ICJ , it is possible that another State which has also accepted the Court 's jurisdiction might seek to bring a case against us . 
This , however , seems a less likely option since Iraq itself could not bring a case and it is not easy to see on what basis any other State could establish that it had a dispute with the UK . 
But we can not absolutely rule out that some State strongly opposed to military action might try to bring such a case . 
If it did , an application for interim measures to stop the campaign could be brought quite quickly -LRB- as it was in the case of Kosovo -RRB- . 
The International Criminal Court at present has no jurisdiction over the crime of aggression and could therefore not entertain a case concerning the lawfulness of any military action . 
The ICC will however have jurisdiction to examine whether any military campaign has been conducted in accordance with international humanitarian law . 
Given the controversy surrounding the legal basis for action , it is likely that the Court will scrutinise any allegations of war crimes by UK forces very closely . 
The Government has already been put on notice by CND that they intend to report to the ICC Prosecutor any incidents which their lawyers assess to have contravened the Geneva Conventions . 
The ICC would only be able to exercise jurisdiction over UK personnel if it considered that the UK prosecuting authorities were unable or unwilling to investigate and , if appropriate , prosecute the suspects themselves . 
It is also possible that CND may try to bring further action to stop military action in the domestic courts , but I am confident that the courts would decline jurisdiction as they did in the case brought by CND last November . 
Two further , though probably more remote possibilities , are an attempted prosecution for murder on the grounds that the military action is unlawful and an attempted prosecution for the crime of aggression . 
Aggression is a crime under customary international law which automatically forms part of domestic law . 
It might therefore be argued that international aggression is a crime recognized by the common law which can be prosecuted in the UK courts . 
In short , there are a number of ways in which the opponents of military action might seek to bring a legal case , internationally or domestically , against the UK , members of the Government or UK military personnel . 
Some of these seem fairly remote possibilities , but given the strength of opposition to military action against Iraq , it would not be surprising if some attempts were made to get a case of some sort off the ground . 
We can not be certain that they would not succeed . 
The GA route may be the most likely , but you are in a better position than me to judge whether there are likely to be enough States in the GA who would be willing to vote for such a course of action in present circumstances . 
Finally , I must stress that the lawfulness of military action depends not only on the existence of a legal basis , but also on the question of proportionality . 
Any force used pursuant to the authorisation in resolution 678 -LRB- whether or not there is a second resolution -RRB- : must have as its objective the enforcement the terms of the cease-fire contained in resolution 687 -LRB- 1990 -RRB- and subsequent relevant resolutions ; be limited to what is necessary to achieve that objective ; and must be a proportionate response to that objective , ie securing compliance with Iraq 's disarmament obligations . 
That is not to say that action may not be taken to remove Saddam Hussein from power if it can be demonstrated that such action is a necessary and proportionate measure to secure the disarmament of Iraq . 
But regime change can not be the objective of military action . 
This should be borne in mind in considering the list of military targets and in making public statements about any campaign .

2005-04-28,"Tony Blair at a Labor poster launch this morning . 
Photograph : Bruno Vincent\/Getty The full 13 pages of the attorney general 's formerly confidential advice on the legality of the Iraq war were today published as the prime minister , Tony Blair , battled accusations that he misled parliament and the cabinet over its contents . 
The long-lobbied-for disclosure follows the publication on Guardian Unlimited yesterday evening of a two-page summary of the advice . 
The government has previously resisted all attempts to secure its release . 
Lord Goldsmith 's confidential minute of March 7 said he could make a `` reasonable case '' for Britain to go to war with Iraq without a second UN resolution but a court `` might well conclude '' this course of action was illegal under international law . 
Further paragraphs released today also reveal Lord Goldsmith advised Mr Blair that in those circumstances he could not guarantee legal action would not be brought against members of the armed forces or government . 
Mr Blair , speaking at the launch of Labor 's business manifesto , said his preference had been for a second resolution but when it was clear France would use its security council veto to block any ultimatum that was no longer an option . 
`` The purpose of the advice was to make it clear we could proceed by law , '' the prime minister said . 
`` The attorney general 's advice was necessary to say the war could proceed lawfully . '' 
Lord Goldsmith 's full advice ruled out self-defence and humanitarian motives for war . 
It instead examined and gave support to the argument that resolution 1441 of November 2002 had revived the authority of UN security council Resolution 678 in 1990 to go to war with Saddam Hussein if he had not stuck to the 1991 ceasefire . 
`` Once he advised that , the question for everybody was political , '' Mr Blair said today . 
`` Did we think we should proceed , notwithstanding the fact we could not get a second UN resolution ? 
`` And I took the view then , I take it now , that it was better for this country 's security , and the security of the world , to remove Saddam and put him in prison rather than have him in power . '' 
The legal advice , however , said that the lawfulness of military action depended on the question of what was proportionate to disarm Iraq . 
`` Regime change can not be the objective of military action , '' Lord Goldsmith wrote . 
Mr Blair was backed up on stage by the chancellor , Gordon Brown , and the trade secretary , Patricia Hewitt , as he faced questioning over whether the cabinet was aware of the full extent of the attorney general 's advice . 
Mr Brown said the cabinet had `` full discussions on numerous occasions '' and saw a lengthy document on the legal issues involved before it backed the invasion . 
Mr Blair said he `` took '' the cabinet through the legal issues and Ms Hewitt said Lord Goldsmith had been present at the cabinet discussions . 
Lord Goldsmith 's full advice had concluded that the government would need `` hard evidence '' that Iraq was not cooperating with UN weapon inspectors if it was to argue it could go to war on the basis of past UN resolutions . 
The 13-page minute was sent to Mr Blair on the same day that the chief UN weapons inspector , Hans Blix , declared that Iraq had made `` substantial '' progress in destroying its long-range missiles , and he found no evidence of biological or chemical weapons . 
It appears at odds with the parliamentary answer issued by Lord Goldsmith 10 days later that concluded it was `` plain '' that Iraq was in breach of its UN disarmament obligations . 
Mr Blair said evidence released by the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , on March 15 2003 had shown that Saddam was in clear breach of his UN disarmament obligations . 
`` This so-called smoking gun has turned out to be a damp squib , '' he said . 
Mr Brown , meanwhile , paid tribute to the prime minister 's handling of the pre-war diplomacy . 
`` I not only trust Tony Blair but I respect Tony Blair for the way he went about that decision , '' he said . 
Earlier , the Conservative leader , Michael Howard , demanded that Mr Blair explain why Lord Goldsmith changed his legal advice and why the prime minister has repeatedly maintained that it did not change . 
`` Last night we received devastating new information which exposed that when Mr Blair said ' I have never lied ' , he was not telling the truth , '' he said . 
`` We 've been told by Mr Blair that on March 17 - just 10 days later - the advice given by the attorney general to cabinet was clear and it had n't changed . 
We now know beyond any doubt that it had changed . '' 
The Liberal Democrat leader , Charles Kennedy , stoutly resisted calls for him to accuse Mr Blair of being a liar but echoed Mr Howard 's call for answers , saying that the prime minister must `` come clean with the British public '' over the legality of the Iraq war . 
"
2005-04-28,"Full text : Iraq legal advice The full text of the advice about the legality of war with Iraq given by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , to the prime minister , Tony Blair , on March 7 2003 1 . 
You have asked me for advice on the legality of military action against Iraq without a further resolution of the Security Council . 
This is , of course , a matter we have discussed before . 
Since then , I have had the benefit of discussions with the Foreign Secretary and Sir Jeremy Greenstock -LRB- the then British ambassador to the UN -RRB- , who have given me valuable background information on the negotiating history of resolution 1441 . 
In addition , I have also had the opportunity to hear the views of the US Administration from their perspective as co-sponsors of the resolution . 
This note considers the issues in detail in order that you are in a position to understand the legal reasoning . 
My conclusions are summarised at paragraphs 26 to 31 below . 
Possible legal bases for the use of force : 2 . 
As I have previously advised , there are generally three possible bases for the use of force : -LRB- a -RRB- self-defence -LRB- which may include collective self-defence -RRB- ; -LRB- b -RRB- exceptionally , to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe ; and -LRB- c -RRB- authorisation by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter . 
Force may be used in self-defence if there is an actual or imminent threat of an armed attack ; the use of force must be necessary , ie the only means of averting an attack ; and the force used must be a proportionate response . 
It is now widely accepted that an imminent armed attack will justify the use of force if the other conditions are met . 
The concept of what is imminent may depend on the circumstances . 
Different considerations may apply , for example , where the risk is of attack from terrorists sponsored or harboured by a particular State , or where there is a threat of an attack by nuclear weapons . 
However , in my opinion there must be some degree of imminence . 
I am aware that the USA has been arguing for recognition of a broad doctrine of a right to use force to pre-empt danger in the future . 
If this means more than a right to respond proportionately to an imminent attack -LRB- and I understand that the doctrine is intended to carry that connotation -RRB- this is not a doctrine which , in my opinion , exists or is recognized in international law . 
The use of force to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe has been emerging as a further , and exceptional , basis for the use of force . 
It was relied on by the UK in the Kosovo crisis and is the underlying justification for the No-Fly Zones . 
The doctrine remains controversial , however . 
I know of no reason why it would be an appropriate basis for action in present circumstances . 
Force may be used where this authorised -LRB- sic -RRB- by the UN Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter . 
The key question is whether resolution 1441 has the effect of providing such authorisation . 
As you are aware , the argument that resolution 1441 itself provides the authorisation to use force depends on the revival of the express authorisation to use force given in 1990 by Security Council resolution 678 . 
This in turn gives rise to two questions : -LRB- a -RRB- is the so-called `` revival argument '' a sound legal basis in principle ? 
-LRB- b -RRB- is resolution 1441 sufficient to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 ? 
I deal with these questions in turn . 
It is a trite , but nonetheless relevant observation given what some commentators have been saying , that f the answer to these two questions is `` yes '' , the use of force will have been authorised by the United Nations and not in defiance of it . 
Following its invasion and annexation of Kuwait , the Security Council authorised the use of force against Iraq in resolution 678 -LRB- 1990 -RRB- . 
This resolution authorised coalition forces to use all necessary means to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and to restore international eace and security in the area . 
The resolution gave a legal basis for Operation Desert Storm , which was brought to an end by the ceasefire set out by the Council in resolution 687 -LRB- 1991 -RRB- . 
The conditions for the ceasefire in that resolution -LRB- and subsequent resolutions -RRB- imposed obligations on Iraq with regard to the elimination of WMD and monitoring of its obligations . 
Resolution 687 suspended , but did not terminate , the authority to use force in resolution 678 . 
Nor has any subsequent resolution terminated the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 . 
It has been the UK 's view that a violation of Iraq 's obligations under resolution 687 which is sufficiently serious to undermine the basis of the ceasefire can revive the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 . 
In reliance on this argument , force has been used on certain occasions . 
I am advised by the Foreign Office Legal Advisers that this was the basis for the use of force between 13 and 18 January 1993 following UN Presidential Statements on 8 and 11 January 1993 condemning particular failures by Iraq to observe the terms of the ceasefire resolution . 
The revival argument was also the basis for the use of force in December 1998 by the US and UK -LRB- Operation Desert Fox -RRB- . 
This followed a series of Security Council resolutions , notably resolution 1205 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . 
Law Officers have advised in the past that , provided the conditions are made out , the revival argument does provide a sufficient justification in international law for the use of force against Iraq . 
That view is supported by an opinion given in August 1992 by the then UN Legal Counsel , Carl-August Fleischauer . 
However , the UK has consistently taken the view -LRB- as did the Fleischauer opinion -RRB- that , as the ceasefire conditions were set by the Security Council in resolution 687 , it is for the Council to assess whether any such breach of those obligations has occurred . 
The US have a rather different view : they maintain that the fact of whether Iraq is in breach is a matter of objective fact which may therefore be assessed by individual Member States . 
I am not aware of any other state which supports this view . 
This is an issue of critical importance when considering the effect of resolution 1441 . 
The revival argument is controversial . 
It is not widely accepted among academic commentators . 
However , I agree with my predecessors ' advice on this issue . 
Further , I believe that the arguments in support of the revival argument are stronger following adoption of resolution 1441 . 
That is because of the terms of the resolution and the course of the negotiations which led to its adoption . 
Thus , preambular paragraphs 4 , 5 and 10 recall the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 and that resolution 687 imposed obligations on Iraq as a necessary condition of the ceasefire . 
Operative paragraph -LRB- OP -RRB- 1 provides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions , including the resolution 687 . 
OP13 recalls that Iraq has been warned repeatedly that `` serious consequences '' will result from continued violations of its obligations . 
The previous practice of the Council and statements made by Council members during the negotiation of resolution 1441 demonstrate that the phrase `` material breach '' signifies a finding by the Council of a sufficiently serious breach of the cease-fire conditions to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 and that `` serious consequences '' is accepted as indicating the use of force . 
I disagree , therefore , with those commentators and lawyers , who assert that nothing less than an explicit -LRB- underlined -RRB- authorisation to use force in a Security Council resolution will be sufficient . 
In order for the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 to be revived , there needs to be a determination by the Security Council that there is a violation of the conditions of the ceasefire and that the Security Council considers it sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the ceasefire . 
Revival will not , however , take place , notwithstanding a finding of violation , if the Security Council has made it clear either that action short of the use of force should be taken to ensure compliance with the terms of the cease-fire , or that it intends to decide subsequently what action is required to ensure compliance . 
Notwithstanding the determination of material breach in OP1 of resolution 1441 , it is clear that the Council did not intend that the authorisation in resolution 678 should revive immediately -LRB- underlined -RRB- following the adoption of resolution 1441 , since OP2 of the resolution affords Iraq a `` final opportunity '' to comply with its disarmament obligations under previous resolutions by co-operating with the enhanced inspection regime described in OPs 3 and 5-9 . 
But OP2 also states that the Council has determined that compliance with resolution 1441 is Iraq 's last chance before the ceasefire resolution will be enforced . 
OP2 has the effect therefore of suspending the legal consequences of the OP1 determination of material breach which would otherwise have triggered the revival of the authorisation in resolution 678 . 
The narrow but key question is : on the true interpretation of resolution 1441 , what has the Security Council decided will be the consequences of Iraq 's failure to comply with the enhanced regime . 
The provisions relevant to determining whether or not Iraq has taken the final opportunity given by the Security Council are contained in OPs 4 , 11 and 12 of the resolution . 
OP4 provides that false statements or omissions in the declaration to be submitted by Iraq under OP3 and failure by Iraq at any time to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of resolution 1441 will constitute a further material breach of Iraq 's obligations and will be reported to the Council for assessment under paragraphs 11 and 12 of the resolution . 
OP11 directs the Executive Chairman of UNMOVIC and the Director-General of the IAEA to report immediately to the Council any interference by Iraq with inspection activities , as well as any failure by Iraq to comply with its disarmament obligations , including the obligations regarding inspections under resolution 1441 . 
OP12 provides that the Council will convene immediately on receipt of a report in accordance with paragraphs 4 or 11 `` in order to consider the situation and the need for compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security '' . 
It is clear from the text of the resolution , and is apparent from the negotiating history , that if Iraq fails to comply , there will be a further Security Council discussion . 
The text is , however , ambiguous and unclear on what happens next . 
There are two competing arguments : -LRB- i -RRB- that provided there is a Council discussion , if it does not reach a conclusion , there remains an authorisation to use force ; -LRB- ii -RRB- that nothing short of a further Council decision will be a legitimate basis for the use of force . 
The first argument is based on the following steps -LRB- a -RRB- OP1 , by stating that Iraq `` has been and remains in material breach '' of its obligations under relevant resolutions , including resolution 687 amounts to a determination by the Council that Iraq 's violations of resolution 687 are sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the ceasefire and therefore , in principle , to revive the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 ; -LRB- b -RRB- the Council decided , however , to give Iraq `` a final opportunity '' -LRB- OP2 -RRB- but because of the clear warning that it faced `` serious consequences as a result of its continued violations '' -LRB- OP 13 -RRB- was warning that a failure to take that `` final opportunity '' would lead to such consequences ; -LRB- c -RRB- further , by OP 4 , the Council decided in advance -LRB- underlined -RRB- that false statements or omissions in its declaration and `` failure by Iraq at any time -LRB- underlined -RRB- to comply with , and cooperate fully in the implementation of , this resolution '' would constitute `` a further material breach '' ; the argument is that the Council 's determination in advance -LRB- underlined -RRB- that particular conduct would constitute a material breach -LRB- thus reviving the authorisation to use force -RRB- is as good as its determination after -LRB- underlined -RRB- the event ; -LRB- d -RRB- in either event , the Council must meet -LRB- OP 12 -RRB- `` to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security '' , but the resolution singularly does not say that the Council must decide what action to take . 
The Council knew full well , it is argued , the difference between `` consider '' and `` decide '' and so the omission is highly significant . 
Indeed , the omission is especially important as the French and Russians made proposals to include an express requirement for a further decision , but these were rejected precisely to avoid being tied to the need to obtain a second resolution . 
On this view , therefore , while the Council has the opportunity to take a further decision , the determinations of material breach in OPs 1 and 4 remain valid even if the Council does not act . 
The second argument focuses , by contrast , on two provisions in particular of the resolution : first , the final words in OP4 -LRB- `` and will be reported to the Council for assessment in accordance with paragraphs 11 and 12 below '' -RRB- and , second , the requirement in OP12 for the Council to `` consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant Council resolutions in order to secure international peace and security '' . 
Taken together , it is argued , these provisions indicate that the Council decided in resolution 1441 that in the event of continued Iraqi non-compliance , the issue should return to the Council for a further decision on what action should be taken at that stage . 
So far as OP4 of the resolution is concerned , one view is that the words at the end of this paragraph indicate the need for an assessment by the Security Council of how serious any Iraqi breaches really are and whether they are sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the ceasefire . 
This argument is supported by public statements to the effect that only serious cases of non-compliance will constitute a further material breach . 
Thus , the Foreign Secretary stated in Parliament on 25 November that `` material breach means something significant ; some behavior or pattern of behavior that is serious . 
Among such breaches could be action by the Government of Iraq seriously to obstruct or impede the inspectors , to intimidate witnesses , or a pattern of behavior where any single action appears relatively minor but the action as a whole add up to something deliberate and more significant : something that shows Iraq 's intention not to comply '' . 
If that is right , then the question is who makes the assessment of what constitutes a sufficiently serious breach . 
On the UK view of the revival argument -LRB- though not the US view -RRB- that can only be the Council , because only the Council can decide if a violation is sufficiently serious to revive the authorisation to use force . 
It is right to say , however , that such an argument has less force if OP4 operates automatically . 
Thus , the wording of OP4 indicates that any failure by Iraq to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of the resolution will constitute a further material breach -LRB- leaving aside the question of whether false statements or omissions in the OP3 declaration is an additional requirement -RRB- . 
If OP4 means what it says : the words `` cooperate fully '' were included specifically to ensure that any instances of non-cooperation would amount to a further material breach . 
This is the US analysis of OP4 and is undoubtedly more consistent with the view that no further decision of the Council is necessary to authorise force , because it can be argued that the Council has determined in advance that any failure will be a material breach . 
It has been suggested that it is possible to establish that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity through the procedures in OPs 11 and 12 without regard to OP4 , in which case it is unnecessary to consider the effect of the words `` for assessment '' . 
I do not consider that this argument really assists . 
First , the resolution must be read as a whole . 
Second , I accept that it is possible that a Council discussion under OP12 may be triggered by a report from Blix and El-Baradei under OP11 and that this may have the effect of establishing that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity granted by OP2 . 
But I do not consider that it can be argued seriously that OP4 does not apply in these circumstances . 
It is clear from a comparison of the wording of paragraphs 4 and 11 that any Iraqi conduct which would be sufficient to trigger a report from the inspectors under OP11 would also amount to a failure to comply with and cooperate fully in the implementation of the resolution and would thus also be covered by OP4 . 
In addition , the reference to paragraph 11 in OP4 can not be ignored . 
It is not entirely clear what this means , but the most convincing explanation seems to be that it is a recognition that an OP11 inspectors ' report would also constitute a report of further material breach within the meaning of OP4 and would thus be assessed by the Council under OP12 . 
Moreover , the US see OP4 as an essential part of the mechanism for establishing that Iraq has failed to take its final opportunity . 
Read the second part of the advice .

2005-04-28,"Thursday 28 April 2005 13.03 BST The head of the United Nations weapons inspectors in the run-up to the Iraq war , Hans Blix , last night undercut one of the main grounds offered by the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , in his legal advice to Tony Blair . 
Lord Goldsmith said there would have to be evidence that Iraq was not complying with the inspectors . 
But Mr Blix , who has since retired to Sweden , said his inspectors found no compelling evidence that Iraq had a hidden arsenal or was blocking the work of the inspectors . 
He said there had been only small infractions by Iraq . 
`` We did express ourselves in dry terms but there was no mistake about the content , '' he said . 
`` One can not say there was compelling evidence . 
Iraq was guilty only of small infractions . 
The government should have re-evaluated its assessment in the light of what the inspectors found . 
`` We reported consistently that we found no weapons of mass destruction and I carried out inspections at sites given to us by US and British intelligence and not found anything . '' 
In a key passage in the legal advice written by Lord Goldsmith on March 7 2003 , the attorney general said that UN resolution 1441 could only be sustainable as a justification for war `` if there are strong factual grounds for concluding that Iraq has failed to take the final opportunity . 
In other words , we would need to be able to demonstrate hard evidence of non-compliance and non-cooperation . '' 
He said the views of Unmovic , the UN inspectorate body , and the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN nuclear watchdog , will be `` highly significant '' and `` you will need to consider very carefully whether the evidence of non-cooperation and non-compliance by Iraq is sufficiently compelling '' . 
Mr Blix and his team returned to Iraq in December 2002 after a four-year absence and remained until the week before war began in March 2003 . 
More than 200 inspectors crisscrossed Iraq , checking out possible sites for the production or stockpiling of weapons of mass destruction : chemical , biological or nuclear . 
Mr Blix 's first monthly report to the UN security council in January was mainly negative about the Iraqi government , complaining about lack of cooperation . 
A month later he adopted a more neutral stance , pointing out some infringements but finding no significant stockpiles . 
On March 7 , the day Lord Goldsmith drew up his report , Mr Blix gave his final report and this was the most favourable yet from Iraq 's point of view . 
Asked if this final report amounted to the compelling evidence that Lord Goldsmith considered crucial , Mr Blix said : `` One can not say so . 
There were infractions , you can say . 
In March , they -LRB- the Iraqis -RRB- cooperated like hell . 
In December and January , no. . 
That is why I gave a critical account on January 27 . 
In February , it was more balanced . '' 
On March 7 , Mr Blix pleaded for more time to complete his mission and reported that lethal weapons such as Samoud 2 missiles were being destroyed . 
Mr Blix said last night : `` The things found were all small things . 
We found dozens of munitions for chemical weapons . 
They were empty and in a site declared . 
In relation to Samoud that went beyond 150 kilometres , they -LRB- the US and Britain -RRB- said it was beyond the permitted limit but I did not feel particularly indignant about that . '' 
On the same day , the head of the IAEA , Mohamed ElBaradei , reported that there was no evidence that Saddam Hussein had any nuclear weapons or was in the process of acquiring them . 
Mr Blix said : `` By then , Mohamed ElBaradei revealed that Niger was not authentic . '' 
British intelligence falsely claimed Iraq had been trying to acquire uranium from Niger . 
Mr Blix said Mr ElBaradei had also challenged US claims that aluminium tubes found were for WMD purposes . 
Mr Blix himself also expressed scepticism to the US secretary of state , Colin Powell , about alleged evidence of WMD . 
The Iraq Survey Group , set up by the US to search for WMD , found none . 
In Britain , inquiries into the route to war have been held by MPs , Lord Hutton and Lord Butler . 
The intelligence service was criticised for not re-evaluating its assessments in the light of Mr Blix 's reports .

2005-04-29,"Friday 29 April 2005 12.53 BST Sergeant Hasan Akbar -LRB- l -RRB- of the US army 's 101st Airborne Division is led from the courtroom at Fort Bragg , North Carolina during the sentencing phase of his court martial for a 2003 attack on his fellow soldiers in Kuwait . 
Photograph : Gerry Broome\/AP A US military jury has imposed the death penalty on a Muslim soldier who launched a fatal grenade and rifle attack on his comrades in the run up to the invasion of Iraq . 
Sgt Hasan Akbar , 34 , quietly apologised yesterday for attacking his fellow soldiers in the early morning of March 23 2003 , when he lobbed grenades into troop tents and fired on soldiers in the ensuing chaos . 
The army 's 101st Airborne division was stationed at Camp Pennsylvania in Kuwait , awaiting orders to begin the invasion . 
Captain Chris Seifert , 27 , from the army and Major Gregory Stone , 40 , from the air force were killed , and 14 others wounded in what prosecutors described as an attack driven by religious extremism . 
Akbar is the first soldier since the Vietnam war to be convicted of killing a comrade during wartime . 
The 15-member military jury in Fort Bragg , North Carolina took just two and a half hours to convict Akbar of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder last week . 
It deliberated for about seven hours in the sentencing phase . 
The sentence will be reviewed by a commanding officer and automatically appealed . 
If Akbar is executed , it would be by lethal injection . 
`` I want to apologise for the attack that occurred . 
I felt that my life was in jeopardy , and I had no other options . 
I also want to ask you for forgiveness , '' Akbar told the jury before it passed sentence . 
Akbar spoke for less than a minute , delivering an unsworn statement that could not be cross-examined . 
He spoke in such a low voice that even prosecutors sitting nearby had trouble hearing . 
While the defense contends Akbar was too mentally ill to plan the attack , they have never disputed that he threw grenades or fired on soldiers . 
Prosecutors say Akbar launched the attack at his camp because he was concerned about US troops killing fellow Muslims in the Iraq war . 
`` He is a hate-filled , ideologically driven murderer , '' chief prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Michael Mulligan said , adding that Akbar had written in his diary in 1997 that his would not be complete `` unless America is destroyed '' . 
If the death sentence is upheld , Akbar will join five others on the military 's death row at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas . 
The last US military execution was in 1961 . 
`` Hasan Akbar has robbed me of so many things , '' Tammie Eslinger , Stone 's fiancee , said after the sentencing . 
`` He stole my love , my family , my dreams and my future . 
But he could never steal my spirit . '' 
Seifert 's widow said she was satisfied with the military justice system and called Akbar `` a nonentity to me '' . 
Defense lawyer Major David Coombs told jurors that a sentence of life without parole would allow Akbar to be treated for mental illness and possibly rehabilitated . 
`` Death is an absolute punishment , a punishment of last resort , '' he said . 
A defense psychiatrist testified that although Akbar was legally sane and understood the consequences of his attack , he suffered from forms of paranoia and schizophrenia . 
Akbar 's father , John Akbar , has said his son complained in vain to his superiors about religious and racial harassment before the attack . 
The defense never introduced any witnesses to testify about any such harassment . 
John Akbar was not in the courtroom for the verdict . 
He emerged from a meeting with his son in tears and declined to comment .

2005-04-30,"Saturday 30 April 2005 02.22 BST Sudan 's Islamist regime , once shunned by Washington for providing a haven for Osama bin Laden as well as for human rights abuses during decades of civil war , has become an ally in the Bush administration 's `` war on terror '' . 
Only months after the US accused Khartoum of carrying out genocide in Darfur , Sudan has become a crucial intelligence asset to the CIA . 
In the Middle East and Africa , Sudan 's agents have penetrated networks that would not normally be accessible to America , one former US intelligence official told the Guardian . 
Some of that cooperation has spilled over into the war in Iraq : Sudan is credited with detaining foreign militants on their way to join anti-American fighters there . 
Sudanese agents have also helped the CIA to monitor Islamist organizations in Somalia . 
`` The intelligence relationship is the strongest thread between Washington and Khartoum , '' the official said . 
`` Khartoum is probably the only government in the Arab League that has contributed in a major way to the protection of US forces and citizens in Iraq . '' 
News of the growing cooperation was first reported in yes terday 's Los Angeles Times . 
The paper traced the thaw in relations since 2001 to a milestone last week : the visit to Washington by Sudan 's intelligence chief , Salah Abdallah Gosh . 
It reported that Sudan 's secret police had begun to crack down on suspected Islamists , had shared evidence with the FBI and allowed US personnel to interrogate al-Qaida suspects . 
In May 2003 , Sudanese security forces raided a suspected terrorist training camp and deported more than a dozen , mainly Saudi , militants to Arab states which work closely with US intelligence services , the newspaper said . 
Yet a decade ago Sudan was a haven to Bin Laden and other international outlaws , such as Carlos the Jackal . 
In 1993 , it was placed on the US state department 's list of terrorist regimes . 
Approaches from Khartoum were rebuffed - even as it offered its services against an emerging al-Qaida in the 1990s . 
`` Sudan tried to hand over two guys implicated in the 1998 bombing of the US embassies in east Africa , and the response was to send cruise missiles to hit the aspirin factory in Khartoum , '' the official said . 
`` They offered up Bin Laden in 1995 , and we said we do n't even have an indictment on him . '' 
Officially , Washington 's position towards Sudan remains unchanged . 
`` Sudan is still considered a state sponsor of terror , '' a state department spokesman said yesterday . 
News of General Gosh 's visit to Washington caused consternation in human rights circles . 
The general is among 51 Sudanese officials implicated in human rights abuses by the international criminal court . 
`` I quite understand that the war on terrorism means dealing with bad actors , but to fly in one of Sudan 's chief committers of what Washington has formally described as genocide is deeply disturbing , '' said an independent Sudan analyst , Eric Reeves . 
He noted there had been signs of a slight thaw towards Khartoum for some time - despite the state department 's official stance .

2005-05-01,"As casualties soar , America 's women face reality of front line Joanna Walters reports from New York on how Iraq is changing the face of warfare Sunday 1 May 2005 02.34 BST Facing the highest ever casualty rate for servicewomen in its history , America is considering making official what is already a reality - allowing women to fight on the front line in war . 
The ground war in Iraq has made the historical tradition of not having women in combat unworkable . 
A total of 35 US servicewomen have now died in Iraq and 271 have been injured . 
It is a small percentage of the 1,500 US service personnel fatalities and the 11,600 wounded , but these women are being killed and injured under enemy fire . 
Three days ago army private Sam Huff was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery . 
She was 18 and died on 18 April when her convoy was blown up by a roadside bomb . 
` Beneath that beautiful young lady was a backbone of steel , ' her sergeant , Sam Jones , wrote in a letter read aloud at her hometown funeral in Tucson , Arizona . 
Huff 's parents reluctantly let her join the army when she was 16 and she quickly gained a reputation for enthusiasm and grit . 
` She 's the bravest kid I 've ever known , ' said her father , Robert Huff . 
` She was up and down that damned road between Baghdad and the airport , which is notorious for improvised explosive devices . 
But she knew the risks and believed in the mission . ' 
Dawn Halfaker was arguably more fortunate than Huff . 
The 25-year-old Californian is home from Iraq now and has been spending time before attending post-graduate college snowboarding and playing basketball - with one arm . 
She had already been in firefights and had killed insurgents when she went on a routine reconnaissance patrol with her military police platoon in Baquoba one night last year . 
They were ambushed and a rocket-propelled grenade screamed into her armored vehicle . 
It tore off the arm of Sergeant Norberto Lara , sending the limb flying into the driver 's lap , then exploded at Halfaker 's shoulder , blasting her head and arm . 
Medics kept her alive until they reached a base , where her last words before passing out were : ` You bastards better not cut my arm off . ' 
She woke up an amputee , dreams of becoming a professional basketball player as shattered as her body . 
But she has no regrets about being a soldier in a modern war zone . 
` Woman in combat is not really an issue . 
It is happening , ' she said . 
Fighting insurgents across Iraq makes for a chaotic battlefield . 
` Everyone pretty much acknowledges there are no rear battle areas , no forward line of troops , ' said Halfaker . 
Four women died under enemy fire in the Gulf war , where female troops made headlines flying combat aircraft , driving supply trucks close to the front lines and being taken as prisoners of war . 
Eight servicewomen died during the Vietnam war - all nurses - and hundreds have died in previous conflicts , but as auxiliary troops or medics serving far to the rear , succumbing most often to disease and accidents . 
In 1994 Bill Clinton opened up 90 per cent of military jobs to women . 
But although that meant they could officially go into combat by air and by sea , they were and still are barred from units that go on the offensive on land , including the general infantry , the marines and the special forces , and from units that accompany those troops . 
Army documents have now surfaced , however , recommending a lifting of the ban on women in units serving alongside other units that primarily go into combat . 
Officials say it is no more than a discussion document at this stage , others say it is the first step towards sanctioning women in land combat . 
` The government will probably not deal with this until the Iraq conflict is over , otherwise , if it went the wrong way , they could face having to pull the women out of Iraq who are there now , who are de facto in combat , ' said Lory Manning , a retired navy captain and director of the Centre For Women in Uniform in Washington DC . 
Women are firing missiles from helicopters , but are not yet going on the offensive on the ground in Iraq , Manning said . 
But they are returning fire in ways never seen before . 
Paratrooper Kellie McCoy of St Louis , Missouri , has just returned to Iraq after a break following her award of a bronze star with a rare ` V ' for valor . 
McCoy , 29 , was only on her third day in Iraq last September when her convoy ran into an ambush during the attack on Falluja . 
She cranked out machine-gun rounds until she had killed enough of the enemy to break through and escape , rescuing others on the way . 
` Captain McCoy willingly and repeatedly took action to gather up her soldiers under enemy fire and direct fire at the enemy , ' her citation stated . 
` Her actions inspired her men to accomplish the mission and saved the lives of her fellow soldiers . ' 
Such tributes , and they are few but not isolated , rebuff the myth that men ca n't go to war with women because sexual tensions or their urge to protect them will sink morale . 
And the argument that the public would not stand for news of servicewomen coming home in coffins has not been borne out . 
Women are being awarded bronze stars and record numbers are receiving the booby prize of the wounded , the Purple Heart . 
One such is Major Ladda Duckworth , the most severely wounded of five female amputees in rehab at Walter Reed Army Hospital . 
The Black Hawk pilot lost both legs and a huge chunk of one arm when her helicopter was shot down . 
Staff were shocked when she was brought in . ' 
I think they had not seen a female that badly mutilated , ' said 37-year-old Duckworth , from Illinois . 
Now all she wants is to fly again and says she joined the ranks because ' I wanted to take the same risks as the guys . ' 
But Elaine Donnelly , president of the Centre for Military Readiness in Washington , still argues that : ` The concept of equality does not fit in combat environments . 
The nation has got used to the idea of women dying in combat , and I do n't think that 's a good thing . ' 
Manning points out that no one wants to see combat casualties of either gender and says none of the deaths in Iraq is justified - because the war itself is not . 
` But if you are going to fight wars , women have to be there , and they have shown how tough they can be when they need to be , ' she added .

2005-05-02,"Monday 2 May 2005 14.00 BST An Italian report into the shooting dead of one of its secret agents by US troops in Iraq is expected to differ sharply with a Pentagon investigation when it is published later today . 
The US military said its soldiers had followed their rules of engagement but the Italian report will pick apart US conclusions on the incident , the Italian press reported . 
Secret agent Nicola Calipari was shot dead at a US checkpoint on the approach to Baghdad airport as he shielded Giuliana Sgrena , a hostage whose freedom he had just negotiated , from the gunfire . 
Ms Sgrena , who survived the shooting , insists no warning shots were fired but the US soldiers told investigators they fired into the air and flashed lights to order the car to slow down . 
The Italian foreign ministry said yesterday that the report would illustrate flaws in the rules of engagement for checkpoints and problems with coordination between authorities in Iraq . 
Disputing the finding of the US report that the Italian agents did not inform the US military of their rescue mission , the Italian report contends that it informed the US command of the operation several hours before the shooting and of Ms Sgrena 's release 25 minutes before Calipari was killed . 
Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica said the report argues that a rapid removal of evidence from the site of the shooting made a proper inspection impossible . 
The two Italian experts who participated in the joint US-Italian investigation - a diplomat and a military intelligence general - refused to endorse the Americans ' conclusions . 
When several days of negotiations failed to yield a common report , both sides went their own way on the findings . 
Silvio Berlusconi is a staunch US ally in Iraq and deployed 3,000 troops after the fall of Saddam Hussein but Italian involvement in Iraq is not supported by public opinion . 
Some Italian politicians have urged withdrawal from Iraq in protest at the incident but Rome and Washington sought to play down the row . 
Roberto Calderoli , reforms minister in the rightwing government , said differences over the investigation into Calipari 's death should trigger `` an attentive and deep reflection on when our troops should come back , '' according to comments reported in La Stampa . 
The Italian defense minister , Antonio Martino , told Reuters the dispute would not harm relations between the two countries as he attended a service with the US ambassador near Rome to commemorate the end of the second world war . 
Mel Sembler , the US ambassador to Italy , said the ties between the two would hold . 
`` As you can see today , the relations between the United States and Italy are strong and will remain strong , '' he told Reuters . 
`` This is a 60-year relationship . 
There are bumps along the road . ''

2005-05-03,"Tuesday 3 May 2005 19.30 BST The 2005 general election campaign has been a defective democratic event in many ways . 
Yet beneath the surface there has echoed a national conversation of passion and seriousness . 
Thoughtful people have debated for months with families , friends and colleagues - and with themselves - about how to vote in this contest . 
Much of the electorate is still undecided . 
It is an imperfect choice conducted under the imperfect electoral system which is nevertheless the only one that we have got . 
What to do on Thursday ? 
Let 's be honest : it is difficult . 
This newspaper 's answer to this unshirkable question involves taking the long and broad view . 
While 2005 will be remembered as Tony Blair 's Iraq election , May 5 is not a referendum on that one decision , however fateful , or on the person who led it , however controversial . 
Like all others , this election must in the end come down to a verdict between the candidates and parties that will produce a parliament and a government . 
Yet Iraq overhangs this election for many . 
It is the issue that makes them most squeamish about voting Labor . 
The decision to bend this country 's foreign and defense policy quite so pliantly to US imperatives has taken a terrible toll on public confidence in the way this country is run . 
It has been a dreadful distraction from other priorities , of which climate change is the most important . 
It is the root cause of an equally destructive toll on Mr Blair 's public standing and of a wounded anger that has haunted this campaign all the way to May 5 . 
But does this mean that we recommend a vote against Labor ? 
Nearly a century ago , the great editor of this newspaper , CP Scott , reflected in this column on an approaching election in terms that are as relevant today as they were then . 
As a result of three-cornered contests , Scott wrote : `` It is quite possible that while Liberalism and Labor are snapping and snarling at each other the Conservative dog may run away with the bone . 
That would be lamentable . '' 
If such an outcome would have been lamentable in the early 20th century , it would be just as lamentable in the early 21st . 
The Conservative party is the worst answer to what is wrong with Britain . 
Immediately this is because of the damaging and divisive campaign on immigration that Michael Howard has run this time . 
For this reason alone , it is vital to stop the Conservatives . 
But there is a longer term reason too . 
Eight years on from 1997 , the Tory party has not rethought what it wants to offer the British people in the 21st century . 
Until it does , it does not deserve to be elected . 
CP Scott speaks across the century on other matters too . 
Scott spent much of his life arguing for what he described as the `` reunion '' of the `` party of progress '' . 
Today , that division remains a reality . 
Eight years ago , on the eve of the 1997 election , we described ourselves as recognizing `` without embarrassment or apology that we , the Liberal Democrats and the Labor party are companions on the journey down the same broad river of progressive politics '' . 
In 2005 , though we have all been tumbled about by some rapids , that remains true . 
The modern progressive consensus of which Gordon Brown speaks will be the work not of one party alone , but of two . 
In that general sense , therefore , we would not be true to this newspaper 's deep traditions if we saw anything wrong in principle with a switch of allegiance between the two progressive parties in 2005 . 
People must vote their conscience , and there are powerful reasons for casting one 's vote for the Liberal Democrats this time . 
This is especially the case because the Liberal Democrats opposed the Iraq war , as this newspaper also did . 
But it is also because the Liberal Democrats have been vigilant and rational in their defense of individual liberty since September 11 2001 . 
The party at least grasps , as many in Labor do not , that fairness , liberty and the law are not merely pieces on a political chessboard , to be sacrificed in some cold-blooded trade-off with the need for security , but are also part of the soul and identity of this nation . 
It may be , indeed , that the time is approaching when the Liberal Democrats will be electorally powerful enough , politically coherent enough and well enough led to be considered as a true party of government . 
That depends partly on Labor and partly on the Liberal Democrats themselves . 
If and when it happens , we look forward to it . 
But that time is not yet and not now . 
There is too much that is unconvincing about Liberal Democrat thinking on too many important subjects . 
The party needs to stare more unflinchingly at the possibility and reality of power than it has yet done . 
That is not something one can now say about Labor . 
Labor has become comfortable in power . 
There are alarming , unattractive and plain unacceptable aspects of this , many of them embodied in the way Mr Blair took us to war . 
If there was one general overarching change we would demand from Labor in the parliament to come it is that it should better respect the visible and invisible lines of the separation of powers in British government : the centrality of parliament , the importance of cabinet , the independence of the judges , the indispensable role of independent scrutiny and audit . 
Ours is not a presidential system . 
Yet Labor 's comfort with power has strengths too , and no one feels them more than the millions who have little voice in the running of any aspect of modern Britain . 
Labor this week stands on the threshold of something it has never achieved : a third successive working majority in parliament . 
It stands there because , over the past 11 years Mr Blair and Mr Brown have systematically forced the party to rethink itself . 
As a result Labor has left behind the era of unheroic failure and has made itself the master of the era of steady , incremental success . 
Millions of people owe essential parts of their present prosperity and greater opportunities to Labor 's methodical investment in the public services and the common realm . 
It is too easy sometimes to overlook the real substance of what Labor has achieved in these years . 
In the first place , it has built a stable economic platform - low inflation , sustained growth , low unemployment - which makes everything else possible and which would be at great risk under any other government . 
Second , it is on the way to winning the argument about the need for public service investment that is the cornerstone of all possibility of real social justice . 
Having started the work in rebuilding the health service , investing in schools and modestly redistributing , Labor has a powerful case for now going further , exemplified by the plans for early years support for young families . 
It is the most redistributive of all the main parties and it deserves support on that count alone . 
There is much to regret about the eight years of Labor government - the missed opportunities , among which Europe stands out , the enduring fear of offending corporate vested interests , the underestimate of what could have been achieved amidst the national and international goodwill of the early years , the sometimes disabling effect of the frequently formidable Blair-Brown relationship . 
Above all there has been the visible transformation of the prime minister himself from a figure of almost limitless modern social-democratic possibilities and gifts to a widely disrespected leader whose political shelf-life is now clearly - and rightly - limited . 
Mr Blair 's recent career has illustrated the wisdom of the late Roy Jenkins , one of the great losses to British life since 2001 , who observed that no political leader can - or should - continue at the top for more than a decade . 
We believe that Mr Blair should be re-elected to lead Labor into a third term this week . 
But the spotlight of the election has underlined that he was right to pledge not to seek a fourth . 
We do not call for him to be elected on Thursday and step down on Friday ; apart from anything else , that would be a betrayal of the democratic verdict . 
But we do not think it is in many interests for Mr Blair to hang on longer than is politically expedient . 
We are not uncritical of Mr Brown or whoever else succeeds him . 
In his final days our late colleague Hugo Young , another vast loss to liberal Britain , quoted the admonition of the psalm not to put one 's trust in princes . 
We shall remember those words . 
In the end an election is about choosing a government and a parliament . 
We are clear where we stand , in spite of our misgivings . 
We want to see Labor re-elected to government and we want to see more Liberal Democrats returned to parliament , at whichever other party 's expense . 
What we do not want are more Tory MPs , so we therefore urge progressive voters in the overwhelming majority of Labor or Liberal Democrat held seats to rally behind the incumbent party . 
Only in a tiny handful of seats - see elsewhere in today 's paper - is it safe for Labor voters to switch to the Liberal Democrats without the risk of allowing the Tories to win . 
Elsewhere , think very carefully before you vote . 
You are voting not just for yourself but for others , frequently less fortunate , whose life chances rest on your good sense . 
CP Scott would have understood such dilemmas . 
The difficulty arises , he once wrote , `` not from the nature of things but from the defects of our electoral system '' . 
That is as true today as it was 100 years ago . 
Reform of that system must be part of the agenda for any future progressive consensus . 
In the absence of reform , however , voters should use their heads and hearts to re-elect Labor with an increased Liberal Democrat presence .

2005-05-03,"Tuesday 3 May 2005 11.57 BST Guardsman Anthony Wakefield by the Tyne in his home city of Newcastle . 
Photograph : Owen Humphreys\/PA A Coldstream Guardsman was killed and another injured by the blast of a roadside bomb in southern Iraq late yesterday , the Ministry of Defense said . 
The two were on a night patrol in armored Land Rovers of the 1st Battalion , Coldstream Guards , near Amara . 
The Shia-dominated city in the British-controlled zone has seen relatively few attacks in recent months . 
The dead soldier was named as Guardsman Anthony John Wakefield , 24 , from Newcastle upon Tyne , who was married with three children . 
`` He was acting as the top cover sentry in the second of a two-vehicle patrol when what appears to have been an improvised explosive device detonated - disabling the vehicle and injuring another soldier , '' Lt Col Andrew Williams said . 
`` Despite receiving first aid at the scene and in the helicopter that evacuated him , he sadly died of wounds . '' 
His colleague is thought not to be seriously injured . 
The war in Iraq has been high on the general election agenda for the past week , and the death of a soldier so close to polling day will add to the pressure on Tony Blair . 
Details of the attack emerged as insurgents continued their onslaught on Baghdad , with four car bombs killing 14 people yesterday on the eve of the swearing-in of the Iraqi government cabinet . 
Explosions shook the capital for a fifth consecutive day , and civilians again bore the brunt of attacks ; at least 127 people have been killed since a new administration was formed last week . 
Nine people died when a van packed with explosives blew up in a mixed Shia and Sunni shopping district , hurling glass and debris across the street . 
The defense secretary , Geoff Hoon , said yesterday that Guardsman Wakefield 's death had come on what had been expected to be a routine operation . 
He was the first British serviceman killed in action since January , and the 87th to die since March 2003 . 
Last year Amara , on the Tigris near the Iranian border , saw fierce fighting between the city 's 1,000-strong British garrison and the Mahdi army militia of a radical Shia cleric , Moqtada al-Sadr , who led two uprisings against the US-led occupation . 
Since a ceasefire agreed last August , attacks on British troops had dwindled to just a few small-scale efforts each week that until Sunday caused no casualties . 
Amara is 90 % Shia , and its residents turned out in force for the election that gave Shias their first taste of power in decades . 
Mr Blair , speaking in London at Labor 's election news conference , said he offered his `` profound condolences '' to Guardsman Wakefield 's family . 
The prime minister said his death `` underlines once again the extraordinary work and sacrifice that British armed forces are making in Iraq , to help Iraq become a stable and democratic country that 's no longer a threat to its region and the world '' . 
The Conservative leader , Michael Howard , expressed his `` deep sympathy and sincere condolences '' to Guardsman Wakefield 's family , and the Liberal Democrat deputy leader , Sir Menzies Campbell , said : `` It 's a reminder that we have 8,000 young men and women in Iraq who expose themselves to danger on a daily basis . '' 
Yesterday Guardsman Wakefield 's seven-year-old son Scott stood to attention in his pyjamas on the doorstep of the family home in Newcastle upon Tyne . 
In a trembling voice he said : `` I am proud of my daddy ; he served his country and he died a hero . '' 
His mother , Ann Toward , 30 , told how she had been told of her husband 's death early yesterday . 
`` I heard a knock at the door at 3.30 this morning and knew instantly what had happened , '' she said . 
`` I answered the door to a man in a smart suit who handed me his card saying he was from the MoD . 
I invited him in and he broke the news ... I am devastated and shocked . 
`` He was such a brave man , I had two children with him and I am trying to explain to them that their dad wo n't be coming home . 
It is very , very hard , it is only just beginning to sink in . '' 
Ms Toward last night blamed the prime minister for her husband 's death . 
Speaking on the ITV News Channel , she said Mr Blair had deprived her three children of their father . 
`` He sent the troops over and he should not have done it . 
If it was not for that , their dad would have been here today . '' 
Besides Scott and Corey , two , Guardsman Wakefield also had a stepdaughter Stacey , 11 , from Ms Toward 's previous relationship . 
Ms Toward added : `` It is only just beginning to sink in for Scott , he has been talking about his dad and wants to write him a letter to tell him how proud he is that he fought and died for his country . 
He had been in the army for six years . '' 
The couple had been married for two years , but were in the process of separating . 
Ms Toward said that she remembered her husband as a `` wonderful , fun , happy man - we were so close it was only the amount of time he was away that took its toll . '' 
A classified version of the US report into the shooting of Italian agent Nicola Calipari , killed escorting the freed Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena to safety , last night revealed the true strength of the insur gency , writes Gary Younge . 
A computer error enabled readers to remove blacked out parts of the document by simply cutting and pasting . 
Confidential elements of the report revealed that , `` from 1 November 2004 to 12 March 2005 there were a total of 3,306 attacks in the Baghdad area . 
Of these , 2,400 were directed against Coalition Forces '' .

2005-05-04,"Dave Corrigan was proud to be a British soldier serving in Iraq . 
Then he was wounded and his nightmare began . 
He tells Ed Vulliamy why , as the only war casualty in Tony Blair 's constituency , he 'll be voting against the PM - and why his old comrades should all be brought home There are few soldiers who wear their medals and the blazer and tie of the Parachute Regiment with as much pride as Corporal Dave Corrigan after 22 years in both the regular and territorial army . 
So when he was called up to go to Iraq in March 2003 , at five days notice , `` I was proud to be there , serving my country '' . 
But then things started going wrong . 
First , Corrigan was wounded , and endured what he calls a `` catalogue of negligence '' by the army , so that he is now suing the Ministry of Defense . 
Recently , his closest friend - `` the brother I never had '' -LRB- and whose identity he wishes to protect -RRB- - was killed in Iraq . 
And now come the latest revelations about the dubious legality of the war : `` We were sent there , and boys are coming back in coffins , all because of a massive lie '' , says Corrigan . 
`` I 'm not politically minded in any way , but I 've got a brain . 
I 'm not anti-regiment or anti-military , but now I can see that we should not have been there in the first place . 
All this about Iraq in the news now , it 's really getting under my skin . 
Tony Blair has let me down , let the troops down , and let the country down . '' 
Here comes the twist : Corrigan lives in Tony Blair 's constituency of Sedgefield . 
At the last election , he voted for the prime minister ; this time he will vote for Reg Keys , father of Lance Corporal Tom Keys , who was horribly killed along with five other Royal Military Policemen in Iraq in June 2003 . 
`` And if Reg was n't standing , '' says Corrigan , `` I would n't vote at all . '' 
While families have spoken out , the voices of soldiers who served in - let alone were wounded in - the war in Iraq are seldom heard . 
Earlier this year the MoD refused requests by the Guardian to interview casualties . 
At one point , the authorities of the hospital in which most of the 900 wounded in Iraq are treated , at Selly Oak in Birmingham , were happy for the Guardian to visit a ward where military and civilian casualties are treated alongside one another . 
But the MoD has vetoedtheir permission . 
But Corrigan has now - finally - been medically discharged from the territorial army to which he has devoted most of his life , `` and now that I can , I want to speak for the lads out there . 
Let 's face it , there are a lot of lads in a much worse position than me . 
And there are many more who feel even angrier than I do about it all . '' 
Corrigan joined the TA , attached to the 4th Parachute Regiment , in 1983 . 
He was named champion recruit and promoted to full corporal within three years . 
From 1989 to 1991 , he served as a regular , professional paratrooper , but resumed his territorial status in order to study for a degree in sports sciences . 
He commuted from County Durham to Nottingham in order to `` stay airborne '' with the paras . 
By 2001 , Corrigan was working as an ambulance technician , and `` changed my cap badge '' to the Royal Army Medical Corps , 144 Parachute Medical Squadron . 
As such , mobilisation to Iraq was compul sory - TA medical personnel are subject to conscription . 
On his birthday , March 22 2003 , Corrigan `` went through the breach '' from Kuwait into southern Iraq as a field ambulance commander with the 16th Air Assault Brigade . 
`` I was proud to be there . 
I was serving my country , and I was doing good ; putting kids into the back of my ambulance with no limbs . '' 
On the night of April 8 came a vicious fire fight at Adaiya , in southern Iraq . 
Corrigan 's regiment took 25 casualties in 45 minutes . 
During a frantic operation to treat the injured - `` I 'll never forget chest-draining one soldier ; we saved his life '' - Corrigan fell from the ambulance , badly damaging his knee . 
He was evacuated back to RAF Halton , near Luton . 
There , what he calls his `` nightmare '' began . 
No one had told Corrigan 's wife that he was injured , let alone back . 
After a two-minute examination , he was , according to his papers , `` discharged to care of civil GP '' - although mobilised TA soldiers are subject to the same care as regular soldiers , until discharged . 
Corrigan , carrying 100lb of battle kit , had to hitch-hike as far as Catterick , Yorkshire , then get a friend to take him home to Newton Aycliffe , County Durham . 
There followed a litany of neglect . 
A baffled local GP referred him to the military wing of the Duchess of Kent hospital in Catterick -LRB- he had to organise and pay for all his own transport -RRB- where he was booked in for an operation three months hence . 
He demanded one immediately and got it : most of the cartilage was removed . 
But the knee worsened , and a second operation five months later revealed a huge tear in his cartilage . 
Despite this , Corrigan was declared fit for a tough rehabilitation course at Catterick , in November 2003 , with a view to returning to Iraq . 
After three weeks of agony , his knee was so bad he was finally demobilised , in February 2004 . 
It was only when he appeared in front of a medical board in York in August that anyone in the army acknowledged the extent of the neglect . 
The board 's president , retired colonel Jimmy Weir , wrote a memo on the history of the case , saying Corrigan had become `` desperate '' and was `` at the end of his tether '' . 
By now , Corrigan had been forced to seek help privately , paying Bupa # 2,100 for a third operation in October 2004 , which removed the remains of the cartilage and found a crack in the patella . 
It also confirmed grade four osteo-arthritis , which had been spotted but ignored during the first , military , operation . 
The injury and subsequent neglect have dashed Corrigan 's professional ambitions in the ambulance service . 
Despite glowing references and the promise of promotion to full paramedic status , his employer , the North East Ambulance Trust , has had to restrict his activities : he can not work at accident scenes , lift patients or drive for longer than 20 minutes . 
Shortly after the third operation , Corrigan wrote to Blair . 
The PM 's agent , John Burton , passed on the case to the defense secretary , Geoff Hoon , on December 15 2004 . 
`` We have other cases of this coming from TA soldiers , and we find it worrying , '' added Burton . 
Hoon replied to Blair on February 22 this year , apologising `` that adequate transport arrangements were not provided '' for Corrigan , and authorising backdated disability allowance that had not been paid . 
Corrigan called the response `` pathetic '' . 
`` I 've asked three times to see Tony Blair , '' he says , `` but it has n't happened . 
I 'm surprised actually - I 'm the only injured soldier in his constituency and he could have turned all this to his account . 
But then , one of the amazing things is that Blair and Hoon have made no effort to visit the wounded , have they , not even in hospital ? 
I think that 's disgusting . '' 
Corrigan has formed strong views on his local MP . 
`` I 'm happy to serve my country , but for the right reasons . 
I 've been amazed by all this that 's coming out in the news , about how it was all a lie , that there were no weapons , that it was illegal . 
I 'm prepared to fight , but not because someone is so far up Bush 's rear end . 
He still ca n't accept it , can he ? 
I think he believes his own lies . 
He seems to have brainwashed himself . '' 
In Iraq , he says , `` it 's become horrendous . 
My friend who died just could n't stand it any more . 
We should n't be there and we should n't have gone there . 
I think it 's important that someone like me says that . 
I think there should be someone who was a soldier saying that , not someone in a suit and tie , saying it for their own ends , but saying it for the sake of the men and women left out there ; that they should n't be there , fighting an unjust war that was lied over . '' 
"
2005-05-09,"Monday 9 May 2005 00.00 BST In June 1971 , Colonel David Hackworth , probably America 's most decorated soldier in Vietnam , appeared on ABC television and told his countrymen that the war could not be won , that US military leaders had failed to understand or train their men for the nature of the country or the conflict , that Saigon would fall to the communists within five years and that one of every five American casualties had been the victim of so-called friendly fire . 
This criticism put Hackworth , who has died of cancer aged 73 , under concerted attack from his superiors , an assault made easier to sustain by the fast and loose approach to regulations he had employed as commander of a Blackhawk air cavalry brigade in Vietnam . 
His troops wore US civil war hats , and Hackworth , as commander of the unit , later became the model for Colonel Kilgore , the abrasive , cigar-chomping officer played by Robert Duvall in the 1979 film Apocalypse Now . 
Hackworth had set up his unit 's own bordello in Vietnam , and the US army used that and other violations to threaten him with court-martial . 
However , General Creighton Abrams , the overall commander in Vietnam , called him `` the best battalion commander I ever saw '' , and , in 1971 , he was allowed to resign with an honorable discharge . 
He threw away his medals in protest , and moved to Australia . 
In the 1980s , Hackworth returned to the US after his medals were reissued , and his book about Vietnam , About Face , became a best-seller . 
From 1990 to 1996 , he was a contributing editor on defense at Newsweek magazine , where , in 1996 , he wrote a column revealing that Admiral Michael Boorda , a former chief of US naval operations , wore combat medals he had not earned . 
When the admiral committed suicide , Hackworth again incurred the military 's wrath . 
He was accused of lying when he claimed to be the army 's `` most-decorated soldier '' - the US keeps no statistics on such matters - and of wearing an unearned Ranger tab . 
An army investigation found that Hackworth had been issued the tag in error , but had never been given a number of medals he had earned . 
His decorations included two distinguished service crosses , the second highest US award for valor , 10 silver stars , eight bronze stars and eight purple hearts . 
After leaving Newsweek , Hackworth wrote a syndicated newspaper column , Defending America , with his third wife , Eilhys England . 
Covering both Iraq wars and peacekeeping actions in Somalia , the Balkans and Haiti , he became a fierce critic of the US establishment . 
His website , Soldiers For Truth , lambasted the Pentagon 's `` perfumed princes '' , whom he claimed constantly betrayed the ordinary solider . 
He was particularly incensed that Donald Rumsfeld used a machine to sign condolence letters sent to the families of dead soldiers in Iraq . 
Hackworth 's army connections began young . 
Orphaned at five months , and raised by his grandmother in Santa Monica , California , he shined shoes at a local army base , becoming a mascot to the soldiers , who gave him his own uniform . 
At 14 , he lied about his age and joined the US merchant marine ; a year later , he paid a sailor to impersonate his father and get him into the army , where he served in postwar Italy , policing the border dispute over Trieste . 
He won his first silver Star in Korea at the age of 20 , when his battlefield commission made him the army 's youngest captain . 
Commanding the Wolfhound Raiders , he led one attack despite being shot in the head , modelling himself on General James Gavin , America 's youngest second world war general -LRB- played by Ryan O'Neal in the 1977 film , A Bridge Too Far -RRB- . 
Hackworth volunteered for service with the US special forces in Vietnam , and , as the army 's youngest full colonel , returned in 1965 , commanding a paratroop unit . 
With General SLA `` Slam '' Marshall , he wrote the Vietnam Primer , a guide to counter-guerrilla tactics . 
He used his theories about the enemy , whom he referred to as `` the G '' , to transform a hapless 4\/39 infantry unit into what became known as the Hardcore Battalion , driving his men so hard they allegedly put a cash bounty on him . 
But he also won their loyalty , by such acts as leading the rescue of a trapped company while riding on the strut of a helicopter . 
It was one of three times on which Hackworth was nominated for the congressional medal of honor , America 's highest award . 
After leaving the army , he was successful in property and restaurants in Brisbane , and became active in the Australian peace movement . 
He returned to Greenwich , Connecticut , in the 1980s . 
Hackworth 's many books included a novel , Price Of Honor , a volume of war dispatches , Hazardous Duty , and a memoir of the hardcore battalion , Steel My Soldier 's Hearts . 
Serving soldiers fed his website with information about the army 's leadership shortcomings . 
Last February , he wrote , `` Most combat vets pick their fights carefully . 
They look at their scars , remember the madness and are always mindful of the fallout ... the White House and the Pentagon are run by civilians who have never sweated it out on a battlefield . '' 
Hackworth died in Tijuana , Mexico , while pursuing alternative treatments for bladder cancer , a common cause of death among soldiers exposed to the dioxins Agent Orange and Agent Blue , used to defoliate Vietnam . 
He is survived by Eihlys and his stepdaughter , two daughters and a son from his first marriage , and a son from his second marriage .

2005-05-09,"The prime minister must accept that most British people want the troops out of Iraq Monday 9 May 2005 00.00 BST Tony Blair insists British troops can not leave Iraq until Iraq 's own police and army can guarantee security . 
It is , of course , the same argument that George Bush uses to justify keeping close to 150,000 US soldiers in the country . 
Never mind the fact that pulling foreign troops out would almost certainly improve Iraq 's security , since much of the violence is directed against the occupation . 
Without the occupation , the insurgency would decline dramatically . 
Let us take Blair 's position at face value . 
Has he not noticed that in Basra and the other two south-eastern provinces where British forces are based the insurgency barely exists ? 
It is true that another British soldier died last week in Amara , a traditionally difficult town , but Basra has been quiet for months . 
Suicide bombers are conspicuous by their absence . 
Attacks on British forces are rare , and fatalities even rarer . 
On election day in January there was almost no violence . 
The reasons are varied , the main one being that the Shia political groups which control Basra are taking the long view . 
They form the backbone of Iraq 's new government in Baghdad and have no particular complaint with the current drift of Iraqi politics nationally . 
Although they are Islamists , the conservative stamp they have put on the city has not been opposed by the British . 
The radical Shias around the cleric Moqtada al-Sadr who strongly denounce the occupation and have taken up arms against it are not as active in Basra as they are in Baghdad and the holy city of Najaf , which is closer to the capital . 
So , although there are special factors which explain it , the bottom line is that Iraq 's south-east has no real insurgency to speak of . 
Why then are British troops needed ? 
What is the threat they are allegedly deterring , and that Iraqis can not handle on their own ? 
Forget the cliches about `` not cutting and running '' . 
Cut the rhetoric about `` the need to finish the job '' . 
British troops could pull out immediately , and neither the people of Iraq 's south-east nor the people of Britain would regret it . 
Bush would not be pleased , but the American president has had to accept that other once-staunch allies have changed their minds and withdrawn their forces . 
Spain , the Netherlands and Poland have seen the light , under pressure from their own electorates . 
Now Blair should do the same . 
How can we say we are trying to bring democracy to Iraq , he should tell the White House , and then not recognize democracy at home ? 
Ten days before the general election an NOP poll showed that 60 % of Britons wanted British troops out by the end of this year . 
Last week 's slashing of the Labor parliamentary majority reinforced that view . 
By accepting that most British people want out of Iraq , and telling Bush we can not remain there purely out of solidarity with the Americans , Blair could go a long way towards restoring the public trust he has lost during the past two and a half years . 
It would not completely erase the effect of Iraq on his premiership -LRB- nothing will -RRB- , but it would at least be a sign that he understands how unpopular his policies over Iraq have been . 
Blair will never admit he was wrong on Iraq , let alone that he lied . 
But by bringing his policies into line with the majority of British people , some of the taint of arrogance would be wiped away . 
Iraq has been a kind of slow-motion Suez for Blair . 
Like Eden in 1956 , he took Britain to war in error , but whereas Eden was forced to resign within three months of his blunder , Blair will have taken four or five years to go . 
For Eden it was more humiliating since what undid him was not the unpopularity of the war . 
The Guardian and Observer opposed Suez , but most British people supported the invasion . 
It was US opposition which undid Eden . 
When Eisenhower came out against the invasion of Egypt , Eden had no choice but to take the blame . 
Blair 's circumstances are different . 
There was no majority for the war before it started , and apart from a few weeks while the invasion was under way , there has been no such support since . 
Ultimately , it is a matter of courage . 
Has Blair the guts to tell Bush that he can not stand beside him any longer on a war which is unpopular in Britain ? 
British troops have been in occupation in Basra for more than two years . 
Their job is done . 
They should leave now .

2005-05-10,"British and US mythology about the second world war ignores our own crimes and legitimises Anglo-American warmaking Tuesday 10 May 2005 00.37 BST In 1945 , as at the end of all wars , the victor powers spun the conflict 's history to serve the interests of their elites . 
Wartime propaganda thus achieved an extraordinary afterlife . 
As Vladimir Putin showed yesterday , the Great Patriotic War remains a key political resource in Russia . 
In Britain and the US , too , a certain idea of the second world war is enthusiastically kept alive and less flattering memories suppressed . 
Five years ago , Robert Lilly , a distinguished American sociologist , prepared a book based on military archives . 
Taken by Force is a study of the rapes committed by American soldiers in Europe between 1942 and 1945 . 
He submitted his manuscript in 2001 . 
But after September 11 , its US publisher suppressed it , and it first appeared in 2003 in a French translation . 
We know from Anthony Beevor about the sexual violence unleashed by the Red Army , but we prefer not to know about mass rape committed by American and British troops . 
Lilly suggests a minimum of 10,000 American rapes . 
Contemporaries described a much wider scale of unpunished sex crime . 
Time Magazine reported in September 1945 : `` Our own army and the British army along with ours have done their share of looting and raping ... we too are considered an army of rapists . '' 
The British and American publics share a sunny view of the second world war . 
The evil of Auschwitz and Dachau , turned inside out , clothes the conflict in a shiny virtue . 
Movies , popular histories and political speeches frame the war as a symbol of Anglo-American courage , with the Red Army 's central role forgotten . 
This was , we believe , `` a war for democracy '' . 
Americans believe that they fought the war to rescue the world . 
For apologists of the British Empire , such as Niall Ferguson , the war was an ethical bath where the sins of centuries of conquest , slavery and exploitation were expiated . 
We are marked forever as `` the good guys `` and can all happily chant `` Two world wars and one world cup . '' 
All this seems innocent fun , but patriotic myths have sharp edges . 
The `` good war '' against Hitler has underwritten 60 years of warmaking . 
It has become an ethical blank cheque for British and US power . 
We claim the right to bomb , to maim , to imprison without trial on the basis of direct and implicit appeals to the war against fascism . 
When we fall out with such tyrant friends as Noriega , Milosevic or Saddam we rebrand them as `` Hitler '' . 
In the `` good war '' against them , all bad things become forgettable `` collateral damage '' . 
The devastation of civilian targets in Serbia or Iraq , torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantnamo , the war crime of collective punishment in Falluja , fade to oblivion as the `` price of democracy '' . 
Our democratic imperialism prefers to forget that fascism had important Anglo-American roots . 
Hitler 's dream was inspired , in part , by the British Empire . 
In eastern Europe , the Nazis hoped to make their America and Australia , where ethnic cleansing and slave labor created a frontier for settlement . 
In western Europe , they sought their India from which revenues , labor and soldiers might be extracted . 
American imperialism in Latin America gave explicit precedents for Germany 's and Japan 's claims of supremacy in their neighbouring regions . 
The British and Americans were key theorists of eugenics and had made racial segregation respectable . 
The concentration camp was a British invention , and in Iraq and Afghanistan the British were the first to use air power to repress partisan resistance . 
The Luftwaffe - in its assault on Guernica , and later London and Coventry - paid homage to Bomber Harris 's terror bombing of the Kurds in the 1920s . 
We forget , too , that British and US elites gave aid to the fascists . 
President Bush 's grandfather , prosecuted for `` trading with the enemy '' in 1942 , was one of many powerful Anglo-Americans who liked Mussolini and Hitler and did what they could to help . 
Appeasement as a state policy was only the tip of an iceberg of practical aid to these dictatorships . 
Capital and technology flowed freely , and fascist despots received dignified treatment in Washington and London . 
Henry Ford made Hitler birthday gifts of 50,000 marks . 
We least like to remember that our side also committed war crimes in the 1940s . 
The destruction of Dresden , a city filled with women , children , the elderly and the wounded , and with no military significance , is only the best known of the atrocities committed by our bombers against civilian populations . 
We know about the notorious Japanese abuse of prisoners of war , but do not remember the torture and murder of captured Japanese . 
Edgar Jones , an `` embedded '' Pacific war correspondent , wrote in 1946 : '' ` We shot prisoners in cold blood , wiped out hospitals , strafed lifeboats , killed or mistreated enemy civilians , finished off the enemy wounded , tossed the dying into a hole with the dead , and in the Pacific boiled flesh off enemy skulls to make table ornaments . '' 
After 1945 , we borrowed many fascist methods . 
Nuremberg only punished a handful of the guilty ; most walked free with our help . 
In 1946 , Project Paperclip secretly brought more than 1,000 Nazi scientists to the US . 
Among their ranks were Kurt Blome , who had tested nerve gas at Auschwitz , and Konrad Schaeffer , who forced salt into victims at Dachau . 
Other experiments at mind control via drugs and surgery were folded into the CIA 's Project Bluebird . 
Japan 's Dr Shiro Ishii , who had experimented with prisoners in Manchuria , came to Maryland to advise on bio-weapons . 
Within a decade of British troops liberating Belsen , they were running their own concentration camps in Kenya to crush the Mau Mau . 
The Gestapo 's torture techniques were borrowed by the French in Algeria , and then disseminated by the Americans to Latin American dictatorships in the 60s and 70s . 
We see their extension today in the American camps in Cuba and Diego Garcia . 
War has a brutalising momentum . 
This is the moral of Taken By Force , which shows how American soldiers became increasingly indiscriminate in their sexual violence and military authorities increasingly lax in its prosecution . 
Even as we remember the evils of nazism , and the courage of those who defeated it , we should begin to remember the second world war with less self - satisfaction . 
We might , in particular , learn to distrust those who use it to justify contemporary warmongering .

"
2005-05-10,"On Friday morning Helen Clark MP lost her seat of Peterborough to the Conservative candidate by a narrow margin . 
On Sunday , Clark announced that she was leaving the Labor party and joining the Tories . 
Their campaign had somehow convinced her that they would be `` a more inclusive and effective party '' . 
As apostasy goes , this is extraordinary . 
Clark was a caricature loyalist in the heady days after 97 , always plus Blairiste que le Blair , and now here she is , ripping into her former leader . 
For those who want to say it , I 'm there before you . 
Have n't I also moved , like Clark , from my former leftiness , to become - as one BBC presenter put it to me - a `` cheerleader for George Bush '' , an apologist for US imperialism , a British neocon , a neoliberal , and all that ? 
Last summer I was sitting outside a cafe talking to a friend when a young black woman , walking by , stopped and asked me whether I was n't David Aaronovitch , `` the evil writer '' . 
She was n't to be persuaded to sit down and talk things over , but told me that my articles were `` racist and sexist '' , and stalked off . 
In the grand scheme of things , if we establish continuums between , say , Richard Littlejohn and Benjamin Zephaniah on race and Jeremy Clarkson and the late Andrea Dworkin on gender , I think that my stuff would tend to be on the left side of the median point . 
Certainly people on the right tend to accuse me of excessive liberalism on such issues . 
So I felt that my accuser was really reacting to something else . 
What has put me beyond the pale has been my support for the Iraq war and - to a lesser extent - my support for the imposition of top-up tuition fees . 
Somehow or other these have become the key determinants of one 's position on the political spectrum . 
Iraq you know about . 
There is a leftwing case for supporting the overthrow of a fascist regime , even if it is done by a rightwing American government . 
And there most certainly is a leftwing case for funding the expansion of higher education through fees that are repayable on graduation into the qualified middle classes , especially when linked to a substantial package for supporting students from poorer backgrounds . 
None of that seems to matter . 
Since I decided , in January 2003 , that if Iraq was invaded I would not oppose it , I have had the almost astral experience of finding myself excommunicated from the movement , sometimes by fellow journalists who I know do not possess a political bone in their entire bodies . 
All of a sudden I began to experience the left from the outside . 
And the first thing that struck me was its capacity for smug certainty and uniformity of response . 
Look at the cartoonists , whose work trumps debate . 
You may have Blair the poodle , Blair with blood-stained hands , Blair the liar , Bush the absurd chimp , but never , ever , Galloway the consort of tyrants or Kennedy the comforter of `` insurgents '' . 
Look at the millionaire publisher Felix Dennis , who read out a poem on the Today program in the middle of the election -LRB- a poem , incidentally , written more than a year earlier -RRB- . 
`` Why do they do it ? 
Why do they do it ? 
Why do they stand on their hind legs , Lying and lying and lying and lying ? '' 
This was , he explained , aimed mostly at Blair for having lied . 
He was n't challenged . 
It was beyond argument . 
Dennis , I 'd guess , had never been challenged . 
Not by the researcher , the producer , the editor , his pals , not by anyone . 
Like a lot of middle-class anti-Blairites , I do n't think he had ever heard the contrary case put . 
During the election people wrote to this newspaper saying that they had n't met a single person who was voting Labor . 
And it does n't matter what is proved to have happened . 
The attorney general 's advice ? 
Never mind what they actually say - that intelligence did judge that Saddam possessed WMDs , that the attorney general did advise that the war was probably legal - the cartoonists tell you that Blair is a liar , the comedians tell you that Blair is a liar , so he 's a liar . 
Sometimes this predetermination becomes bizarre . 
Let me take one example , where I could take thousands . 
These are the words used by writer Richard Gott to describe Blair during this election campaign . 
`` An arrogant and God-fuelled appeaser '' , and `` a war criminal who should be locked up behind bars without a vote '' . 
And this is Gott on Iraqi leaders in mid-2002 . 
`` Saddam has had a violent past '' , but `` is not a charismatic leader '' , partly because he uses `` unconvincing rhetoric '' and is `` incompetent at getting his message across '' . 
Problems are caused by his `` lack of sophistication and the secretive nature of his regime '' . 
Fortunately , however , his deputy , Tariq Aziz - Yuletide host of the new MP for Bethnal Green and Bow - is `` an intelligent , articulate and persuasive politician '' . 
Gott , on a journey to Baghdad , notices that the many pictures of Saddam are not defaced at all . 
Is it , he asks , `` terror , or apathy , or a cultural reluctance to disturb something associated with the state ? 
It is difficult to say , but of overt signs of opposition to the regime , there are none . '' 
Oh , I 'd say it was down to cultural reluctance , would n't you ? 
If they 'd only been a little bit more uninhibited , those Kurds and Shias would happily have taken their magic markers to the odd Saddam statue , Mukhabarat or no Mukhabharat . 
Gott is , of course , a slightly extreme example . 
But it seems to me that mild forms of Gottism are to be found all over the place . 
I know where I 'd have advised readers to put them . 
The Hornsey and Cambridge effects , where Liberal Democrats overturned hefty Labor majorities ? 
With the honorable exception of immigration , a protest vote for the Lib Dems was a vote to say one was on the left while paying nothing for the privilege . 
And it was also a vote for the utterly immoral proposition that , having sent our troops to topple Saddam , we should pull them out no matter what the Iraqi government asked us to do . 
And now we have ancient `` left '' hits revisited , with Frank Dobson , Glenda Jackson and others inviting other Labor party members to join them in a chorus of that 80s press favorite , `` Is this the way to Armageddon ? '' 
You want to know the two reasons she gives for joining the Tories ? 
The `` disastrous escapades '' of the imposition of student top-up fees and the war in Iraq . 
Oh , the unbelievable irony of it ! 
It is for none of these reasons that this is my last column for G2 . 
I 'll not be here for the format change , which I know will be fantastic . 
However , with writers such as Emma Brockes , Laura Barton , Lucy Mangan and Hadley Freeman , not to mention the comic talent of Tanya Gold , you wo n't miss me . 
I will , however , miss some of you .

2005-05-10,"Space Hulk cruises onto mobile THQ Wireless has acquired the rights to bring Games Workshop 's Space Hulk brand to mobile phones . 
Based in the Warhammer 40k universe , the title pitches space marines against evil alien Genestealers in tense galactic battle . 
Space Hulk originated as a board game but was turned into a PC title in the early nineties , and according to the press release , `` THQ Wireless interactive implementation of the brand will remain true to the existing rules and gameplay systems , whilst also addressing the needs of the quick play aspect of mobile handset gaming . '' 
The release goes on to mention some gameplay details : The dynamic game environment offers a multiplicity of game modes and scenarios , including tactical , turn based like the classic tabletop game , as well as frenetic real-time action . 
This makes the game accessible and compelling for as wide a spectrum of handset users as possible . 
With Macrospace 's long-awaited battle strategy sequel Ancient Empires II also due out soon , mobile owners looking for something more mentally stimulating than the next retro conversion are in for a challenging summer . 
Posted by Keith Stuart at 10:48 AM | Comments -LRB- 2 -RRB- | Permalink Attack of the Star Wars games THQ has revealed its opening suite of Star Wars mobile phone games after securing the rights to the movie series earlier this year . 
I 'll do a few reviews later , but for now , here 's a quick rundown of what 's on offer . 
The key release will probably be Star Wars Revenge of the Sith , a side-scrolling light sabre hack em up which allows you to control Obi-Wan , Yoda or Darth Vader . 
Then theres Star Wars : Battle for The Republic , which from the brief press release would appear to be a multiplayer battle strategy game where you guide either Separatist or Republican forces into turn-based battle . 
Advance Wars meets Star Wars ? 
Oh go on then ! 
Star Wars : Grievous Getaway seems to be a sort of flight racing game where you play as Obi-Wan Kenobi on his varactyl beast , hunting down General Grievous . 
Next we have Star Wars : Jedi Arena , which is like Pokemon Stadium , only you select , customise and train a Jedi or Sith warrior instead of a silly monster . 
You then shove your combatant into light saber battles against other players in over-the-air bouts . 
Another Star Wars take on a previously successful title is Star Wars Puzzle Blaster , based around the popular shareware puzzler , and Bust A Move clone , Snood . 
Finally , there are two lighter weight offerings . 
Star Wars Trivia speaks for itself , while the curious Ask Yoda is a sort of Magic 8-ball simulator , where you ask a cartoon depiction of Yoda any ` yes ' or ` no ' question you like and he responds with wise advice . 
I asked if Manchester City would secure a third home win under Stuart Pearce on Saturday , to which he replied You will know when you are calm and at peace . 
Thanks you daft Jedi midget . 
Hell also impart random phrases of Jedi wisdom and Star Wars trivia if you ask . 
This , I think , is not aimed at hardcore gamers . 
Do you remember Yoda Stories on the PC , by the way ? 
Terrible game , but I loved those cute little super-deformed Storm Troopers . 
All of these titles will be probably be released as excitement surrounding Episode III reaches a crescendo rather than afterwards when it deflates like an enormous stinky inflatable Jabba the Hut . 
Posted by Keith Stuart at 10:42 AM | Comments -LRB- 5 -RRB- | Permalink EA has announced its first eight titles as a mobile games publisher . 
As you 'd expect , conversions of the company 's major console brands make up a majority of the offerings with EA SPORTS FIFA Football 2006 , The Sims 2 , Need for Speed Underground 2 , Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 2006 and Madden NFL 2006 all figuring . 
Alongside these , EA has also transferred three casual titles - Poppit ! 
, Turbo 21 , and Tri Peaks Solitaire - from its online gaming service , Pogo . 
From the screens I 've seen , the console conversions look pretty impressive with sharp 3D visuals and , it seems , a few gameplay elements nicked from the latest PS2 and Xbox iterations . 
Bringing the Pogo stuff across to mobile is a smart idea - there are plenty of card and puzzle games available for Java handsets , but few will be as poslished and universally available as EA 's . 
All the titles will be playable at E3 , and EA is promising 12 more before the end of the year . 
Posted by Keith Stuart at 10:37 AM | Comments -LRB- 4 -RRB- | Permalink ` Mobile gamers are n't brand suckers ' claims research company Mobile Games Analyst , a fortnightly research service for the telecomms industry , has studied the mobile game download charts for the last year and come up with some surprising findings . 
It seems that mobile gamers are distinctly unimpressed by big movie and TV licences , prefering to spend their download cash on nostalgic classics and new mobile titles , such as Iomo 's Pub series . 
Here 's what the press release says ... MGA 's research findings also cast doubt on the wisdom of publishers paying inflated licensing fees to secure movie-related brands . 
Of the 47 games that charted during the 12-month period , just two - Digital Bridges ' The Fast And The Furious and Jamdat 's Lord Of The Rings : Return Of The King - were based on movies , and both spent just a single month on the chart . 
Meanwhile , the success rate of console brands was patchy . 
Some console brands , such as Digital Bridges ' FIFA Football and Tiger Woods 2004 , and Gameloft 's Splinter Cell : Pandora Tomorrow performed well , but others - including Wonderphone 's Crash Nitro Kart and Sorrent 's DRIV3R - spent just a single month on the chart . 
`` The poor performance of movie-related brands and some of the console ports indicates that games companies can no longer afford to rely on brands alone to achieve sustainable sales , '' says Pamela Clark-Dickson , editor of MOBILE GAMES ANALYST . 
`` Investment in the development of original IP will likely accelerate in the short-to-medium term , particularly with the increased commitment to mobile of video-games publisher Electronic Arts , which has already stated its intention to create original mobile games . '' 
Okay , so the most successful downloads included Pac-Man and Tetris , but right up there was Pub Pool , a great little pool sim blatantly not based on a movie , TV show or current console brand . 
Of course , there 's every possibility that , when the big videogame publishers realize they ca n't get away with lazy conversions , they 'll just abandon the mobile platform altogether , scratching their heads in bemusement . 
Let 's hope , instead , that they set up dedicated development teams -LRB- hey , we 're talking six people at the most -RRB- and start really investigating what people want from mobile games . 
Or more pertinently , how to get more people to want mobile games . 
Because shoving some lobotomised mini conversion onto the platform and hoping the kids are dumb enough to download it is clearly NOT WORKING . 
Here is the proof . 
Read it and weep . 
And when you 've finished weeping , start writing some decent games .

Nate Adams Freestyle Motocross , which reminded me of 80s budget stormer Kickstart , had a impressive physics engine which gave a subtlety more usually associated with console games . 
Jewel Quest was an addictive version of the casual gaming webgame , but the most enjoyable and instant hit was Skipping Stones - a one button treat that will be good fun on the tube . 
Do n't ditch the DS or PSP just yet , but clearly there is some interesting mobile stuff out there .

Owners of Motorola handsets will be able to download games then play them against other phone users in different countries and on various networks - the site is also set to support leagues , tournaments and in-game chat . 
Motorola has elected to use Terraplay 's mobile multiplayer gaming infrastructure - the same system 3 is using for it 's 3G multiplayer titles . 
`` Motorola believes immersive human-to human-applications will be key drivers for growth in the mobile industry and we are very pleased to be offering such exciting multiplayer games to our customers . 
As part of our ` Innovate ' program we are always looking for the very best technologies , such as Terraplay , to support the considerable capabilities of our handsets , and in addition drive additional revenues for our operator customers . '' 
says Ronan Smyth , Applications Manager , Motorola . 
I like the way he starts with `` Motorola believes ... '' as though the company were a single sentient intelligence . 
Only two launch titles are mentioned - No Refuge by Mobile Interaction and Mole War from Digital Chocolate - but more are promised . 
Clearly , there 's a growing confidence that multiplayer is going to be the missing element that kickstarts this mobile gaming mega-explosion we 've all been waiting for . 
Well , some of us have been waiting for . 
Okay , that I 've been waiting for . 
Posted by Keith Stuart at 05:28 PM | Comments -LRB- 1 -RRB- | Permalink Just received preview code of Skipping Stone , a masterful little mobile game from eccentric Korean developer , Gamevil . 
It 's being released in the UK by I-play very soon , and fans of Wario Ware and its ilk should keep an eye out for it . 
The concept is ridiculously simple - you stand on the beach and skim stones across the sea . 
But the implementation is fantastic , combining Hyper Sports-style sports sim and rhythm action elements . 
To begin with , you select the power of your throw by hitting the 5 button when the speedy power meter reaches its highest point . 
Then , as your pebble skims across the ocean , you keep hitting the 5 button at the right point to maintain the height of the bounces . 
If you hit the perfect position more than twice in a row , you start building up combos - earn enough and you release power-ups , like whales surfacing and shooting your stone even higher . 
Alright , it sounds daft , but it 's wonderfully presented with surreal Anime visuals , and the interface works perfectly . 
There are two game modes , one where you 're looking to make as many splashes as possible and another where your aim is to make the stone go as far as possible before it sinks . 
Offbeat theme , fun graphics , compelling one-touch interface , high-score focus . 
This is where mobile gaming comes into its own . 
Posted by Keith Stuart at 04:10 PM | Comments -LRB- 7 -RRB- | Permalink Misty-eyed Amiga veterans may be interested to know that Kuju Wireless is ready to release its mobile conversion of Sensible Software classic , Cannon Fodder . 
Developed by Tower Studios -LRB- set-up by several ex-Sensibles including Jon Hare -RRB- , it 's a radically sawn-off version of the top-down strategy shooter , missing most of the team-based tactical elements , but still heavy on the relentless enemy blasting action . 
The visuals have been nicely re-produced and you still get to control up to four soldiers , using a sort of rotating cursor interface . 
But there are no hostage missions , or civillians to shoot at ` by accident ' . 
Level design has been simplified too , taking into account the smaller display and the fact that you can no longer set up two of your men on guard duty while the others plough ahead . 
It is possible to split your squad into two , but one lot just stands there while you control the other . 
This lets you protect your men and save a couple of lives for later in the level , but most of the time you 'll be grateful for the extra firepower afforded by having your whole platoon blasting away beneath your cursor . 
Cannon Fodder on mobile includes the jungle , snow and desert terrains but no underground levels . 
Oh and you do get to drive the tanks and take over gun emplacements - these were the moments I really felt I was back there again , back at college , mourning the loss of my veteran soliders , rather than reading Tender is the Night , or some such irrelevant tosh . 
Cannon Fodder kind of works on mobile . 
It works as a fragment of its former self . 
There definitely are moments of the old genius . 
And , if you grew up on cult Amiga titles , it will bring a smirk of recognition to your face . 
Posted by Keith Stuart at 06:01 PM | Comments -LRB- 6 -RRB- | Permalink Another one of those quick mobile game round-ups ... An interesting selection of mobile games has been released and\/or announced over the last couple of days , so here 's a quick run-through . 
This is all rather low-key considering Microsoft 's announcement , but , well , life goes on . 
After all , will the new Xbox have a pub fighting simulation ? 
No , but you can now play one on your phone ... Yes , Iomo 's funny and pretty daft pub sim is now available for download from all the usual sources . 
You play as Terry the landlord fighting off four generations of lager louts , including gangsters , hippies and break dancers . 
It 's not a beat 'em up really , more a rhythm action game based around casual alcohol-fuelled violence . 
There 's a different setting for each decade - the seventies is set in a pub toilet and each bout starts with you at the urinal . 
Your character zips up , turns round and starts kicking disco dancers . 
That , to the best of my knowledge , never happened in Street Fighter . 
Just released by Elkware this is , as the title cunningly suggests , a 3D golf sim . 
The visuals look quite nice , and there are weather effects and customisable characters . 
Another new release , this is a very polished , very playable 2D pool sim from Gameloft . 
The single player mode has a kind of Hustler feel - it 's all based in a smokey pool hall , and you have to gamble cash on each match . 
You also get extra money for pulling off special shots , which is quite a good idea . 
The press release they sent me proudly boasts ` with Lynyd Skynyrd 's Sweet Home Alabama , Midnight Pool is the first mobile game featuring licensed music ! ' . 
This is both funny and sad : funny because it reminds me of the eighties when you got things like ` featuring digitised speach ! ' 
and ' 100 % machine code ' emblazoned on game covers . 
It 's sad because mobile gaming is obviously desperate to ape the console games market , treating any form of licensing as a guaranteed cash cow . 
It 's out everywhere now and you really have to try it . 
This 2D take on the stealth adventure genre is a lesson in brutally simple yet highly effective game design . 
Possibly the most accomplished mobile game conversion I 've ever seen . 
The press release comes with some impressive stats : `` On the day of its release , Tom Clancys Splinter Cell Chaos Theory was made available to Gamelofts 130 operating partners , as well as 150 affiliates . 
Seven hundred different versions were developed in Gamelofts internal studios to accommodate 180 mobile phone models and 5 languages . 
The game is available today in 65 countries worldwide '' . 
Gameloft has acquired the rights to produce a mobile game based around this French cartoon series . 
If you 've somehow missed it , here 's what it 's about : `` Totally Spies is an animated series that enjoys worldwide success . 
Sam , Alex and Clover , three young college students from Beverly Hills , find themselves thrust into the thrilling world of international espionage . 
Thanks to their respective talents , the three heroines must meet a formidable challenge : balance school with the fast paced lives of secret agents ! '' 
Posted by Keith Stuart at 02:13 PM | Comments -LRB- 23 -RRB- | Permalink Lib Dems target mobile users This is slightly off-message , but interesting nethertheless . 
The Liberal Democrats have launched a mobile phone application that invites users to re-assign the # 5bn spent on the Iraq war to other areas such as health , education and the environment . 
Once you 've completed your alternative spending plan you can text it in to an online poll . 
`` Making use of new technology is a good way to engage a section of the population who are used to mobile phones and texting , but do n't find most political campaigning of interest , '' says John Howson , Reading East 's prospective parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Democrats . 
Obviously this is just a slightly more compelling means of polling the electorate , but the interactivity involved in creating your own budget is actually a very simple form of strategy sim . 
Perhaps the Iraq War Calculator hints at a future where parties use downloadable games to introduce election issues to apathetic , technology-literate youngsters . 
It 's certainly something that the major charities are investigating - Unicef , for example , has a great little Flash games site which communicates its work to younger audiences . 
And of course , the next logical step is voting by text . 
Indeed , research company Mobile Youth has recently issued a press release on this very subject : New research form mobileYouth has found that UK teenagers are currently sending over 22 million text messages a year , and with the successful convergence of TV and messaging in formats such as Big Brother , there looks set to be an increase to well over 24 million messages . 
That 's on average of 5 text messages per youth a day . 
The ease of mobile messaging and its mass market appeal has not gone unnoticed with companies such as MTV , BBC and ITV having already incorporated the idea of ` text voting ' into their TV shows . 
Politicians may also find that mobile messaging will enable them to reach directly to the youth population , and harness in those who are able to vote but still do not have the motivation to do so . 
It is precisely among young voters , aged 18-19 where activity peaks and messaging becomes an essential tool for social activity . 
Around 77 % of boys actually considered themselves ` heavy texters ' compared to around 23 % of girls , who all routinely send more than 15 text messages a day . 
On average a UK teenager will spend 20 pounds a month on messaging alone . 
I 'm slightly concerned about giving teenagers the idea that voting for the next government should be viewed in the same context as voting for the next Pop Idol . 
However , maybe this is the logical conclusion for a political culture based around sanitised sound bites and shameful pantomime performances at Prime Minister 's question time .

"
2005-05-11,"Wednesday 11 May 2005 00.00 BST OK , I 'm paranoid and depressed . 
My new government of troglodytes , murderers and spivs barely elongates the customary scream I give upon waking . 
What troubles me more is our rulers ' inevitable recommencement of the war on terror bollocks . 
To begin at what we 're told is the beginning , we have 9\/11 - the one in the US , not the earlier one in Chile when covert US government intervention killed thousands of innocents and handed the country to a commerce-friendly , torture-loving , far-right junta . 
Now if 9\/11\/2001 is so important , why is it so hard to find out what happened ? 
The FBI , as we know , blocked all manner of investigations into the plot in the run up to its execution , whether these involved highly specific warnings from its own agents or from government sources in Afghanistan , Argentina , Britain , the Cayman Islands , Egypt , France , Germany , Israel , Italy , Jordan , Morocco and Russia . 
Meanwhile , I worry why the nearest military aircraft were n't scrambled to intercept any of the hijacked flights when this is standard procedure and why , when more distant jets were finally aloft , they flew at less than half speed , thus failing to prevent the impacts at the twin towers and then , it would seem , managing to shoot down Flight 93 when its passengers may already have overcome its hijackers . 
It would , of course , be easier to know what happened to Flight 93 if there were n't - according to educated estimates - three minutes of the cockpit recording missing . 
It would , equally , be handy to have access to the black boxes from the other crashes . 
Firefighters at Ground Zero have repeatedly stated that three of the four possible black boxes there were found and taken away by government agents . 
And these worries are maybe less important than the ones about clear links between the Pakistani ISI , the CIA and the men named as the 9\/11 hijackers . 
Or the mysterious inability of anyone to capture Osama bin Laden , who fled from Tora Bora , possibly being evacuated by helicopter , and then escaped to Pakistan unhindered . 
So while Chinese paperclips are now made out of vital 9\/11 evidence and almost every implicated party goes free , we and our controlling US interests continue fearlessly to terrorise countries unconnected with the attacks , to place permanent military bases near oil reserves and pipeline routes , to harass and murder Muslims anywhere we can , and to foment terrorist resistance at every opportunity . 
The UK unmasks non-existent ricin plots and threatens us with ID cards , but we ca n't supply our troops in Iraq with working radios or a legal causus belli . 
But you 'd never want to think that on 9\/11\/2001 covert US government intervention killed thousands of innocents and handed the country , if not the world , to a commerce-friendly , torture-loving , far-right junta . 
That would make you a paranoid , depressed conspiracy theorist . 
And , take it from me , that just would n't be comfortable .

2005-05-12,"Thursday 12 May 2005 12.21 BST George Galloway , the newly elected MP for the anti-war Respect party in east London , this morning faces allegations from the US Senate over whether he benefited from the Iraq oil-for-food program run under Saddam Hussein . 
A US Senate committee report published today claims to have uncovered `` significant evidence '' that the former Labor MP was allocated millions of barrels of oil from the Saddam regime . 
It bases its conclusions on previously disclosed documents from the Iraqi ministry of oil and interviews with senior officials of the regime , plus unnamed Iraqi sources . 
Mr Galloway last night denied the allegations . 
He told the Guardian : `` This committee has never spoken to me , never written to me and never asked me a single question and did not even acknowledge last year my offer to go and speak to them . 
It is hardly an investigation . 
`` It is merely the repetition of false accusations that have been made and denied before . 
Something does not become true because it is repeated by George Bush 's Senate majority . '' 
The US report concludes : `` The evidence obtained by the sub-committee , including Hussein-era documents from the ministry of oil and testimony from senior Hussein officials , shows that Iraq granted George Galloway allocations for millions of barrels of oil under the oil-for-food program . 
`` Moreover , some evidence indicates that Galloway appeared to use a charity for children 's leukemia to conceal payments associated with at least one such allocation . '' 
Last night 's report was produced by the staff of the Senate 's permanent subcommittee on investigations , part of the committee on homeland security and government affairs . 
The subcommittee is chaired by Norm Coleman , a Minnesota Republican , who has made it his mission to bring to book those he considers responsible for the Iraqi oil-for-food scandal . 
In December he called for the resignation of the UN secretary general , Kofi Annan . 
Mr Galloway said last night that the oil allocation vouchers were given to a Jordanian businessman , Fawaz Zureikat , who was chairman of his Mariam Appeal , a charity he set up to help a young Iraqi girl suffering from leukemia . 
The MP said the appeal , part of a campaign against United Nations sanctions in Iraq , has already been investigated by the Charity Commission and no impropriety had been found . 
`` In other words , no money ended up in my pocket , '' Mr Galloway said . 
Last week Mr Galloway won a sensational victory against Labor 's Oona King in Bethnal Green . 
He has consistently denied that he personally profited from Iraqi oil sales . 
He won a high court libel action against the Daily Telegraph relating to similar allegations . 
The US Senate committee report says it based its conclusions on documents from the Iraqi oil ministry , distinct from those alleged foreign ministry papers relied upon by the Telegraph . 
`` The documents presented in this report have no relation to those discussed in the Daily Telegraph piece . '' 
In the course of the libel trial , Mr Galloway said he had never received or traded in oil , diverted money from the oil-for-food program , or used the Mariam Appeal as a front for his own personal gain . 
The Senate committee report says that in April 2005 the vice-president of Iraq , Taha Yassin Ramadan , told the committee that Mr Galloway had been granted oil allocations `` because of his opinions about Iraq '' and because Mr Galloway `` wanted to lift the embargo against Iraq '' . 
Another official , the report alleges , told investigators from the US Treasury that `` a member of the British parliament benefited tremendously from the illegal trade of oil by Iraq '' . 
The report said : '' -LRB- The Source -RRB- stated that George Galloway , Labor Party , was the owner of a company that was involved in the Iraqi oil trade scheme . '' 
Mr Galloway last night said that claim was `` preposterous '' . 
`` I do not own any companies . ''

2005-05-14,"Suicide bombing is n't as new or alien as westerners imagine Saturday 14 May 2005 00.01 BST One of the most chilling aspects of the Iraqi conflict is that suicide bombings have now become a matter of everyday routine . 
During April there were 67 , a new record . 
On Wednesday there were no less than five separate suicide attacks across Iraq , killing 71 people and injuring scores of people . 
The rate of suicide bombings - the seemingly endless supply of people prepared to blow themselves up - leaves a western audience utterly bewildered . 
What kind of psychology motivates people to such violent extremes ? 
The incomprehension prompts revulsion that this form of warfare is historically unprecedented and reveals a peculiar , aberrant irrationality - a kind of inhuman madness . 
All too quickly , Islam is blamed for deluding its believers into martyrdom with promises of 72 virgins ; the old prejudices about Islam as a faith uniquely associated with violence and unquestioning belief are fanned into life again . 
But such prejudices wo n't get us very far in trying to unpick which elements of this violent phenomenon are in fact unprecedented and which are not - or to understand why the strategy has been adopted . 
There are two obvious factors . 
First , the plentiful supply of volunteers crossing into Iraq reflects the radicalisation of a generation of the newly urbanised , under-employed , fast growing populations of many Muslim countries in the Maghreb and the Middle East . 
Second , suicide attacks are the single most effective weapon against the vastly superior armed force of the US in their heavily defended camps . 
Along with more conventional resistance tactics , suicide bombings are helping to cripple Iraqi reconstruction and fuelling resentment of the occupation . 
This has successfully derailed US hubris in a `` regional redesign '' . 
How else could all these aims have been achieved ? 
But even while grasping this , suicide bombings still profoundly outrage western sensibility . 
There are two separate aspects of the current wave : the use of suicide as a tactic of war ; and the tendency to deploy it recklessly against soft or civilian targets outside the theater of conflict . 
The latter is a familiar feature of different forms of terrorism - so nothing much new there . 
Suicide attacks also have historical precedent ; but what does seem new , first in Palestine and now in Iraq , has been the combination of the two and their frequency . 
It is that particular combination of individual motivation to kill oneself and the cold ruthlessness to stand among the people one is going to kill before detonating oneself which is hardest to understand . 
Tracing the history of how suicide has been used as a weapon and as a protest through history offers up many illuminating parallels to what might motivate those who undertake the suicide missions in Iraq . 
It was the Japanese who made the use of suicide as a military strategy so feared , and the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka in the 1980s who applied it as a technique for assassinations . 
Both were part of wider military efforts which were not always easily distinguishable from a suicide mission . 
The line in war between a suicidal mission and a reckless disregard for one 's own life can be very blurred . 
This was true in the Soviet struggle against the Germans in the second world war . 
Some Soviet pilots undertook explicit suicide missions to ram bridges in Germany in 1945 ; many others went into battle knowing they would die , and saw their death as a sacrifice for the `` motherland '' . 
It is the powerful who determined how such events are understood ; while the Japanese and Islamist militants are feared as inhuman , the Soviets are celebrated for their courageous defiance of nazism . 
The idea of suicide to serve a set of beliefs is also deeply rooted in history . 
The staging of the current brilliant production of Julius Caesar in London pointedly refers to Iraq with its US military fatigues and the set of a military warehouse . 
Several suicides in the final scenes lead to Brutus 's poignant comment that swords have been turned `` in our own proper entrails '' . 
Roman republicanism , imperial Japanese militarism : both elevated suicide as an honorable part of military valor . 
Even more closely related to Iraq 's suicide bombers is the fascinating description of early Christian martyrdom in Farhad Khosrokhavar 's new book , Suicide Bombers . 
The suicidal recklessness of a large number of early Christians , aimed precisely at bringing about their martyrdom , bewildered and horrified contemporary commentators . 
But martyrdom was an astonishingly effective propaganda tool designed to inspire awe - and converts . 
The Greek origin of the word martyr is `` witness '' . 
Interestingly , it prompted exactly the same sorts of criticism among pagan Romans as today 's Islamist militants do in the west : the Christian martyrs were accused of dementia and irrationality . 
Such was the flood of Christians in pursuit of martyrdom by the third century that the theologians had to step in to declare this thirst for a holy death to be blasphemous . 
That concept of using your death to bear witness to a cause , without killing others , has prompted more than 1,000 suicides since 1963 , when a Buddhist monk set himself on fire in protest against the oppression of Buddhism in Vietnam . 
Global mass media ensure that this individual protest has impact across the world ; it is a desperate but hugely effective way to give the cause prominence . 
Elements of all these precedents can be traced in the research done on motivations of suicide bombers in Palestine , Chechnya and al-Qaida and probably now those in Iraq . 
A sense of humiliation and the need to avenge honor on the part of their faith and\/or people -LRB- or a potent combination of both as in Iraq -RRB- is emphasised by Khosrokhavar . 
He also picks up on how hating the world -LRB- because of the experience of injustice and oppression -RRB- leads to a longing for death - a rejection of this world 's vale of tears . 
These are concepts which are very difficult for westerners living largely comfortable lives to grasp . 
Honour is meaningless to us ; we have replaced it with a preoccupation with status and self-fulfilment . 
We dimly grasp self-sacrifice but only apply the concept to our raising of children . 
Meanwhile , nothing can trump our dedication to the good life of consumer capitalism , and certainly not any system of abstract beliefs . 
Not having experienced the desperation of oppression , we have little purchase on the extremism it might engender . 
Meanwhile , we have medicalised rather than politicised the condition of hating the world and longing for death . 
The gulf in understanding yawns wide . 
But our outraged incomprehension of suicide bombing is also partly because it is the opposite of how we have come to believe wars are fought . 
It is not the high technology of laser-guided bombs , nor the strangely sterile detachment of the aeroplane camera without any images of the screams , smashed bones and blood . 
The west can only now kill from a distance - preferably from several thousand feet up in the air or several hundred kilometres away on an aircraft carrier . 
It is the very proximity of these suicide missions which is so shocking . 
This kind of intimate killing is a reversion to pre-industrial warfare - the kind of brutality seen in the thirty years war , for example . 
Suicide bombers in Iraq are a new permutation of old traditions ; they have no monopoly on the horrors they reveal of the human psyche and its capacity to destroy life .

2005-05-15,"Sir John Scarlett , head of MI6 , has been accused of trying ` to sex up ' a report by the Iraq Survey Group , the body charged with finding weapons of mass destruction after Saddam Hussein was toppled . 
In an exclusive interview , Dr Rod Barton , a former senior weapons inspector in Iraq , has revealed extraordinary details of how Scarlett and a top Ministry of Defense official intervened in a report by the ISG early last year . 
Barton , who has worked for Australian intelligence for more than 20 years , was a special adviser to the ISG in 2004 as it prepared to report that they had found no WMD or any programs to build them . 
Such a report would have been politically damaging in London in the aftermath of the David Kelly affair . 
Speaking from Canberra , Barton describes how in January last year he received a visit in Baghdad from Martin Howard , deputy chief of defense intelligence at the MoD . 
Howard had been criticised for helping to ` out ' Kelly as the source of Andrew Gilligan 's BBC story alleging Downing Street had ` sexed up ' the September dossier on Iraq 's WMD . 
Barton alleges Howard ` spelt out ' that Britain 's preferred option was that a proposed 200-page ISG interim report should not be published at that stage . 
Barton claims the CIA overruled their UK counterparts . 
He alleges that after this Scarlett , then chairman of the Joint Intelligence Committee , tried to get ` nuggets ' placed into a shorter report to imply that Saddam did have a WMD program . 
According to Barton , these were based on old evidence that had been investigated and shown to be false . 
It is understood to include suggestions that Saddam was developing a smallpox weapon and using research to create a nuclear program . 
Barton added : ` The US has finally come to terms with the fact they got it dead wrong . 
The UK is lagging far behind . 
They still have n't come to terms with it . '

2005-05-16,"Final Star Wars bears message for America Lucas wins festival trophy - and hopes his epic will awaken US to democracy in peril Monday 16 May 2005 00.09 BST Soldiers of the Empire stand guard at the Festival Palace before the screening of the latest Star Wars film in Cannes . 
Photograph : Francois Guillot\/AFP\/Getty The republic is crumbling under attack from alien forces . 
Democracy is threatened as the leader plays on the people 's paranoia . 
Amid the confusion it is suddenly unclear whether the state is in more danger from insurgents , or from the leader himself . 
It sounds more like a Michael Moore polemic than a Star Wars movie . 
But George Lucas , speaking as his latest epic was given its world premiere at Cannes yesterday , confirmed that Star Wars Episode III : Revenge of the Sith , could be read as a parable about American politics . 
When he conceived his series of films in the 1970s , he says , he was thinking about Vietnam and Nixon , investigating `` democracy , and how a senate could give itself over , could surrender itself to a dictator '' . 
He found historical echoes down the ages . 
`` I looked at ancient Rome , and how , having got rid of kings , the Senate ended up with Caesar 's nephew as emperor ... how democracy turns itself into a dictatorship . 
I also looked at revolutionary France ... and Hitler . 
`` It tends to follow similar patterns . 
Threats from outside leading to the need for more control ; democracy not being able to function properly because of internal squabbling . '' 
`` I hope that situation never arises in our country , '' he said . 
`` Maybe the film will awaken people to this danger . '' 
Asked whether Star Wars Episode III openly alluded to the Iraq war , he said : `` When I wrote it Iraq did n't exist . 
We were funding Saddam Hussein and giving him weapons of mass destruction . 
We were going after Iran . 
But the parallels between what we did in Vietnam and what we are doing in Iraq are unbelievable . '' 
Lucas yesterday received , amid enormous hoopla , one of the highest honors Cannes can bestow : the Trophy of the Festival , which he was awarded on the world 's largest ocean liner , the Queen Mary 2 . 
His film was screened out of competition at Cannes before its London premiere tonight . 
Lucas said : `` I am happy the film does n't have to compete -LRB- for the Palme D'Or -RRB- , because it probably would n't win . '' 
But he was bullish about the tepid critical reception of the more recent Star Wars films . 
`` I see it all as one movie ; I do n't pay much attention whether people like individual chapters or not , '' he said . 
`` There are two groups of fans for my films : one group over 25 , and the other under 25 . 
The people in their 30s and 40s love the first three , and they are in control of the media and the web . 
`` The more recent ones are fantastically adored by people under 25 and the devotion of each group is about equal ... but one group can express themselves more loudly than the others . 
`` It will be interesting to see what happens in 10 years when the younger group has grown older . ''

2005-05-16,"Monday 16 May 2005 15.43 BST The BBC has been forced to defend Jeremy Paxman 's bad-tempered interview with MP George Galloway on election night , insisting the presenter 's questioning was not insensitive despite more than 100 complaints . 
Paxman 's encounter with Mr Galloway in the early hours of Friday May 6 , following the latter 's shock victory over Labor 's Oona King in Bethnal Green and Bow , became one of the main talking points of the night after the victorious Respect candidate ripped off his microphone and stormed out of the interview . 
More than 100 viewers complained that Paxman was too aggressive and did not focus sufficiently on the Iraq war issue on which Mr Galloway campaigned . 
The BBC man kicked off the interview by asking : `` Mr Galloway , are you proud of having got rid of one of the very few black women in parliament ? '' 
The BBC head of political programs , Sue Inglish , defended Paxman , saying that he opened the Galloway interview with a question about Ms King 's race because a studio guest , former Labor MP Tony Banks , had just raised it . 
`` Some people found Jeremy Paxman 's line of questioning insensitive but , having reviewed the interview in the cold light of day , I do not agree , '' Ms Inglish said . 
`` Jeremy Paxman is renowned for his vigorous questioning and so the directness of the question can hardly have come as a surprise to Mr Galloway . 
That Mr Galloway chose not to take the opportunity he was being offered to say that neither race nor religion nor sex was the issue is a matter for him , but it was a pertinent question to ask . 
`` It was Mr Banks who brought up questions of ethnicity and gender ... When Jeremy Paxman very shortly afterwards had a chance to interview George Galloway , the question he asked was one that many in the audience must at that point have had at the front of their minds ; did Mr Galloway feel uncomfortable about unseating one of the few black women MPs ? 
`` The interview only became bogged down on this issue because George Galloway preferred not to answer the question and move on to other matters . 
However , Jeremy Paxman did explore the issue of Labor unpopularity as a result of the Iraq war in comparative depth in his interview with Labor 's David Lammy , immediately after the abortive exchange with George Galloway . '' 
During the interview , Mr Galloway , speaking on a link from the Bethnal Green and Bow constituency in east London , repeatedly refused to answer Paxman 's opening question and instead challenged the Newsnight presenter to congratulate him on his victory . 
Eventually he retorted : `` All those New Labor MPs who voted for Mr Blair and Mr Bush 's war have on their hands the blood of 100,000 people in Iraq , many of them British soldiers , many of them American soldiers , most of them Iraqis . 
`` That is a more important issue than the color of her skin . 
So do n't try and tell me I should feel guilty about one of the most sensational election results in modern electoral history . '' 
He accused Mr Paxman of `` insulting '' his new constituents by ignoring the result . 
`` They chose me . 
Ca n't you find it within yourself even to congratulate me ? '' 
he asked , before terminating the interview . 
With that the MP stormed off , to which Paxman responded with a bout of his trademark eye-rolling . 
The BBC has also admitted it had too many under-35s in the audience for the Question Time election special on Thursday April 28 , in which Tony Blair , Michael Howard and Charles Kennedy were quizzed in turn by people in the studio . 
More than 70 people called the BBC to complain that there were too many young people in the audience for it to be representative . 
`` Looking back at the program I think that we got most of the balances pretty well right . 
However , I think we were probably under-representative among older people , I accept that , '' said Ric Bailey , the Question Time executive editor . 
`` But I think we did achieve a very lively program in which there was lots of young people who contributed their views and a few older people as well . ''

2005-05-17,"George Galloway addresses the US senate subcommittee for homeland security and governmental affairs in Washington . 
Photograph : Dennis Cook\/AP George Galloway today accused US senators of manufacturing `` the mother of all smokescreens '' as he defended himself from charges that he profited from Iraqi oil sales . 
The anti-war Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow , in east London , told the Senate subcommittee it had made a `` schoolboy howler '' in its investigation of illegal Iraqi oil sales . 
He said it was attempting to divert attention from the aftermath of the US-led invasion of Iraq . 
In a defiant performance on Capitol Hill , Mr Galloway said senators had confused the dating of evidence against him and relied too much on the testimony of a former Iraqi vice president held prisoner in Abu Ghraib . 
`` I know that standards have slipped over the last few years in Washington , but for a lawyer you are remarkably cavalier with any idea of justice , '' he told Senator Norm Coleman , the Republican subcommittee chairman . 
`` I am here today - but last week you already found me guilty . 
You traduced my name around the world without ever having asked me a single question , without ever having contacted me , without ever having written to me or telephoned me , without any contact with me whatsoever - and you call that justice . '' 
Mr Galloway 's testimony rested on two key points : that the documents naming him in the senate report were the same documents the Daily Telegraph had relied upon in a story he later successfully sued over , and that the subcommittee had no evidence he had made the financial gains from Iraqi oil that it alleged . 
`` What counts is not the names on the paper . 
What counts is where 's the money , senator ? 
Who paid me money , senator ? 
Who paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars ? 
`` The answer to that is nobody - and if you had anybody who paid me a penny , you would have produced them here today . '' 
The senate report claimed Mr Galloway and Charles Pasqua , the former French interior minister , were given potentially lucrative oil allocations as a reward for their support in calling for sanctions against Saddam Hussein 's regime to be loosened . 
Mr Pasqua also denies the claims . 
Mr Galloway told the senators they had made a `` schoolboy howler '' in dating their evidence against him to almost a decade earlier than the Daily Telegraph and a period from 1992-93 when the UN oil for food program - the center of the investigation - was not even in existence . 
The MP , elected to parliament on May 5 on an anti-war ticket in the former seat of Oona King , a Tony Blair loyalist , said the Christian Science Monitor , which used documents from the same period had retracted its story and admitted the documents were fake . 
`` It is a proven fact these forged documents existed and were being circulated among rightwing newspapers , '' Mr Galloway told Sen Coleman . 
`` You have nothing on me , senator , except my name on lists of names from Iraq , many of which have been drawn up after the installation of your puppet government in Baghdad , '' he said . 
One of the main allegations in the senate report is that Mr Galloway received oil allocations with the help of Fawaz Zureikat , a Jordanian businessman and chairman of the Mariam appeal set up by the MP to help a 4-year-old Iraqi girl with leukemia . 
The allegations of oil trading links between the two men - denied by both parties - formed the bulk of the questioning of Mr Galloway after he had finished his opening statement . 
He told the senators : `` I can assure you Mr Zureikat never gave me a penny from an oil deal , a cake deal , a bread deal or from any other deal . '' 
When not defending himself against the senate report 's allegations , Mr Galloway attacked the morality of the post-Gulf war sanctions on Iraq and the wisdom of the 2003 US-led invasion . 
He described the sub-committee 's claims as the `` mother of all smokescreens '' , intended to divert attention from the `` crimes '' committed in the invasion of Iraq . 
`` Senator , in everything I said about Iraq I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong - and 100,000 have paid with their lives , 1,600 of them American soldiers sent to their deaths on a pack of lies , '' Mr Galloway told Sen Coleman . 
He insisted he had been a longer-standing opponent of Saddam Hussein than anyone questioning him . 
`` I was an opponent of Saddam Hussein when the British and American governments and businessmen were selling him guns and gas , '' he told the subcommittee . 
`` I have a better record of opposition to Saddam Hussein than you do . '' 
"
2005-05-17,"US ` backed illegal Iraqi oil deals ' Report claims blind eye was turned to sanctions busting by American firms Tuesday 17 May 2005 00.45 BST The United States administration turned a blind eye to extensive sanctions-busting in the prewar sale of Iraqi oil , according to a new Senate investigation . 
A report released last night by Democratic staff on a Senate investigations committee presents documentary evidence that the Bush administration was made aware of illegal oil sales and kickbacks paid to the Saddam Hussein regime but did nothing to stop them . 
The scale of the shipments involved dwarfs those previously alleged by the Senate committee against UN staff and European politicians like the British MP , George Galloway , and the former French minister , Charles Pasqua . 
In fact , the Senate report found that US oil purchases accounted for 52 % of the kickbacks paid to the regime in return for sales of cheap oil - more than the rest of the world put together . 
`` The United States was not only aware of Iraqi oil sales which violated UN sanctions and provided the bulk of the illicit money Saddam Hussein obtained from circumventing UN sanctions , '' the report said . 
`` On occasion , the United States actually facilitated the illicit oil sales . 
The report is likely to ease pressure from conservative Republicans on Kofi Annan to resign from his post as UN secretary general . 
The new findings are also likely to be raised when Mr Galloway appears before the Senate subcommittee on investigations today . 
The Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow arrived yesterday in Washington demanding an apology from the Senate for what he called the `` schoolboy dossier '' passed off as an investigation against him . 
`` It was full of holes , full of falsehoods and full of value judgments that are apparently only shared here in Washington , '' he said at Washington Dulles airport . 
He told Reuters : `` I have no expectation of justice ... I come not as the accused but as the accuser . 
I am -LRB- going -RRB- to show just how absurd this report is . '' 
Mr Galloway has denied allegations that he profited from Iraqi oil sales and will come face to face with the committee in what promises to be one of the most highly charged pieces of political theater seen in Washington for some time . 
Yesterday 's report makes two principal allegations against the Bush administration . 
Firstly , it found the US treasury failed to take action against a Texas oil company , Bayoil , which facilitated payment of `` at least $ 37m in illegal surcharges to the Hussein regime '' . 
The surcharges were a violation of the UN Oil For Food program , by which Iraq was allowed to sell heavily discounted oil to raise money for food and humanitarian supplies . 
However , Saddam was allowed to choose which companies were given the highly lucrative oil contracts . 
Between September 2000 and September 2002 -LRB- when the practice was stopped -RRB- the regime demanded kickbacks of 10 to 30 US cents a barrel in return for oil allocations . 
In its second main finding , the report said the US military and the state department gave a tacit green light for shipments of nearly 8m barrels of oil bought by Jordan , a vital American ally , entirely outside the UN-monitored Oil For Food system . 
Jordan was permitted to buy some oil directly under strict conditions but these purchases appeared to be under the counter . 
The report details a series of efforts by UN monitors to obtain information about Bayoil 's oil shipments in 2001 and 2002 , and the lack of help provided by the US treasury . 
After repeated requests over eight months from the UN and the US state department , the treasury 's office of foreign as sets control wrote to Bayoil in May 2002 , requesting a report on its transactions but did not `` request specific information by UN or direct Bayoil to answer the UN 's questions '' . 
Bayoil 's owner , David Chalmers , has been charged over the company 's activities . 
His lawyer Catherine Recker told the Washington Post : `` Bayoil and David Chalmers -LRB- said -RRB- they have done nothing illegal and will vigorously defend these reckless accusations . '' 
The Jordanian oil purchases were shipped in the weeks before the war , out of the Iraqi port of Khor al-Amaya , which was operating without UN approval or surveillance . 
Investigators found correspondence showing that Odin Marine Inc , the US company chartering the seven huge tankers which picked up the oil at Khor al-Amaya , repeatedly sought and received approval from US military and civilian officials that the ships would not be confiscated by US Navy vessels in the Maritime Interdiction Force -LRB- MIF -RRB- enforcing the embargo . 
Odin was reassured by a state department official that the US `` was aware of the shipments and has determined not to take action '' . 
The company 's vice president , David Young , told investigators that a US naval officer at MIF told him that he `` had no objections '' to the shipments . 
`` He said that he was sorry he could not say anything more . 
I told him I completely understood and did not expect him to say anything more , '' Mr Young said . 
An executive at Odin Maritime confirmed the senate account of the oil shipments as `` correct '' but declined to comment further . 
It was not clear last night whether the Democratic report would be accepted by Republicans on the Senate investigations committee . 
The Pentagon declined to comment . 
The US representative 's office at the UN referred inquiries to the state department , which fail to return calls .

2005-05-17,"Exploitative ... The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael A British film about three teenagers ' drug-fuelled descent into violence has prompted an audience walkout at the Cannes film festival . 
The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael contains a gang-rape scene described by one critic as so violent `` it makes A Clockwork Orange look like a Britney Spears video '' . 
The film , starring Danny Dyer and Lesley Manville , was unveiled to an audience of critics at the festival on Sunday . 
Many stormed out upon seeing the scene in which a teenage gang break into the home of a TV chef , torture and rape his wife . 
The scene is `` a sequence excruciating beyond any in memory '' , according to critics from Variety . 
Screen International magazine described it as `` video nasty territory '' . 
Set in an English seaside town against the backdrop of the Iraq war , the film follows shy teenager Robert Carmichael -LRB- Daniel Spencer -RRB- . 
Although a bright student , he starts skipping school and taking drugs . 
He falls in with Larry -LRB- Danny Dyer -RRB- , who has just finished a prison term for drug possession and assault , and through him starts dealing ecstasy . 
In one scene , Robert watches the invasion of Iraq on TV while a heavily drugged teenage girl is gang-raped in the next room . 
That rape takes place off screen , but a second is shown in graphic detail . 
In a storyline reminiscent of A Clockwork Orange , the gang break into the home of TV chef Jonathan -LRB- Michael Howe -RRB- and his American wife Monica -LRB- Miranda Wilson -RRB- while high on drugs . 
They tie up the couple and take turns to rape Monica in an attack so horrific she bleeds to death . 
The parallels with Kubrick 's film are underlined by a soundtrack of classical music by Elgar and Purcell . 
Debut director Thomas Clay said he wanted audiences to feel `` shocked and disgusted '' by the scene and argued that gang-rapes happen regularly in war zones such as Bosnia and Iraq .

2005-05-18,"Mr Galloway goes to Washington No new revelations - but do not expect the controversy to go away Wednesday 18 May 2005 01.13 BST George Galloway , then a Labor MP , first went to Iraq 10 years ago . 
Up until then he had been identified as a campaigner for the Palestinian cause . 
After his visit to Baghdad he became the most prominent campaigner in the west on behalf of the Iraqi people . 
That zeal has brought him seemingly endless controversy and yesterday led him to appear in front of a senate hearing . 
The senators questioned whether he or an Iraq charity he founded had benefited financially from that involvement with Saddam 's regime . 
The question raised by the senate sub-committee on investigations , led by a Republican , senator Norm Coleman , can be boiled down to a single issue : was Mr Galloway 's 10-year campaign on behalf of the Iraq people motivated , as he says , by his shock at the state of the Iraqi people 's suffering under sanctions or did he become caught up in an intricate financial network set up by Saddam to buy influence in the west ? 
Mr Galloway , a newly elected MP for the anti-war Respect party , insists it was entirely altruistic . 
What is the background to the hearing ? 
Mr Galloway campaigned vigorously on behalf of Iraq from the time of his first visit through to the outbreak of the war two years ago . 
In 1998 he established the Mariam appeal , initially to help a four-year-old Iraqi girl suffering from leukemia but which broadened into a campaign against sanctions . 
Two years later a Jordanian businessman , Fawaz Zureikat , was appointed to chair the appeal . 
Mr Zureikat had extensive business dealings with Saddam 's Iraq . 
The Iraq Survey Group published documents last year , which were reproduced again last week by the senate sub-committee , suggesting that Mr Zureikat and Mr Galloway had been allocated millions of barrels of oil by Saddam 's government . 
Mr Galloway reiterated yesterday that while his name may have appeared on the documents , he never received anything , not `` even a slim dime '' . 
Did we learn anything new from the senate hearing ? 
The short answer is no. . 
Mr Galloway pointed out various errors in the senate report , such as the investigators mixing up allegations made by the Daily Telegraph with those made by the Christian Science Monitor , which the paper later admitted were based on forgeries . 
Mr Galloway also pointed out that he had never met the former vice-president of Iraq Taha Yassin Ramadan , who was quoted in the senate sub-committee report as saying Mr Galloway had been allocated the oil because of his opinions about Iraq . 
The MP questioned the cred-ibility of Mr Ramadan as a witness , given he was a US prisoner possibly facing a death sentence , and of another unnamed Iraqi source . 
Mr Coleman focused on the crux of the allegations : the relationship between Mr Galloway and Mr Zureikat . 
The Jordanian businessman gave # 375,000 to the Mariam appeal , but there is no evidence that this money came from the oil allocations . 
Mr Galloway said he had never received a penny from the Iraqi government or from Mr Zureikat . 
He knew that Mr Zureikat had business dealings with Iraq but did not know that these involved oil until 2003 . 
Mr Coleman challenged Mr Galloway on whether it was credible that he had not discussed the source of the donation to the Mariam appeal with Mr Zureikat . 
Does the senate hearing mark the end of the affair ? 
Mr Galloway is regarded as a minor player in the senate sub-committee 's investig-ation . 
The main purpose of the investigation is to demonstrate the weakness of the United Nations . 
Mr Coleman has already called for the resignation of the organization 's secretary-general , Kofi Annan . 
But , with so many US Congressional inquiries into Iraq 's finances under Saddam under way and with so many British journalists sore that they have failed to nail Mr Galloway after two decades of controversy , the issue is not going to go away . 
The relationship between Mr Galloway and Mr Zureikat will continue to be explored , especially if , as Mr Galloway hinted yesterday , his friend is prosecuted . 
Mr Coleman , at a press conference after yesterday 's hearing , said there would be `` consequences '' if Mr Galloway was found to have lied to the hearing . 
But the bottom line , as Mr Galloway pointed out , is that neither the senator nor anyone else was able to provide any evidence in the form of bank accounts or any other pieces of paper to show that Mr Galloway had received any money from Saddam , Mr Zureikat or anyone else linked to Iraq .

2005-05-18,"Surrounded by journalists and politics students , Respect MP turns Washington hearing into an indictment of the invasion of Iraq George Galloway testifies to a US Senate committee . 
Photograph : Dennis Cook\/AP George Galloway confronted his accusers in the US senate yesterday , denying any involvement in Iraqi oil trades and using the occasion to unleash an indictment of the war with a stunning ferocity . 
Mr Galloway , the newly elected MP for Bethnal Green and Bow , was appearing before the senate investigations sub-committee examining sanctions-busting oil deals in Iraq before the war . 
In a lengthy preamble before his appearance , senate staff presented a series of documents , enlarged and printed on huge white boards , which they said were Iraqi government memoranda naming Mr Galloway as the recipient of highly lucrative allocations of cheap Iraqi oil under the UN-administered Oil For Food program . 
Senator Norm Coleman , the Republican committee chairman who has taken the lead in making allegations against Mr Galloway , repeatedly insisted that the hearing was `` not a court of law '' . 
But the early stages were nothing if not lawyerly , with Mr Coleman very much in the role of chief prosecutor . 
In a low businesslike voice , the senator from Minnesota read out an indictment of Mr Galloway running through the evidence against him . 
`` Senior Iraqi officials have confirmed that you , in fact , received oil allocations and that the documents that identify you as an allocation recipient are valid , '' Mr Coleman said . 
`` If you can provide any evidence that challenges the veracity of these documents or the statements of former Iraqi officials , we 'd welcome that input . '' 
Then it was the Respect party leader 's turn and any sense of judicial propriety was instantly shattered . 
The courtroom became a vaudeville theater , as the MP lampooned his interrogators , accusing them of making `` schoolboy howler '' mistakes . 
Mr Galloway insisted that he was entirely innocent . 
`` Senator , I am not now nor have I ever been an oil trader and neither has anyone on my behalf , '' he declared , in language that deliberately echoed that of Joe McCarthy 's anti-communist witch-hunt conducted half a century ago just metres from the chamber used for yesterday 's hearing . 
`` I have never seen a barrel of oil , owned one , bought one , sold one , and neither has anybody on my behalf , '' he said . 
The wide , wood-panelled room was packed with journalists and spectators . 
A group of politics students stood at the back . 
The turnout among senators was less spectacular , however . 
Only four appeared for the start of the hearing . 
By the time Mr Galloway took the microphone , there were only two left , Mr Coleman and Carl Levin , the leading Democrat on the panel . 
Witnesses in this August setting , a little below and surrounded by the horseshoe bench of powerful senators , are usually awed and almost always on the defensive . 
Mr Galloway was on the attack from the first moment . 
He entered the hearing room with guns blazing , telling journalists his inquisi tors were `` crazed '' , `` pro-war '' , `` lickspittles '' of the president , and predicting he would turn the tables on them . 
`` I want to put these people on trial . 
This group of neo-cons is involved in the mother of smokescreens , '' he said . 
That was the common theme in a feat of bare-knuckled rhetoric not often witnessed by the senators , who are accustomed to considerably more reverence for their positions . 
CNN called it a `` blistering attack on senators rarely heard or seen on Capitol Hill '' . 
Mr Galloway deflected every charge against him and flung it back at the Bush administration and the US congress . 
For example , he denied the committee 's claim that he had met Saddam many times , claiming there had only been two such meetings - and that the US defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , had met the then Iraqi president the same number of times , to sell arms , Mr Galloway said . 
`` Now , you have nothing on me , senator , except my name on lists of names from Iraq , many of which have been drawn up after the installation of your puppet government in Baghdad . '' 
The senators mostly soaked up the punches , reserving judgment until a press conference later , when Mr Coleman claimed Mr Galloway 's credibility was `` very , very suspect '' . 
In the hearing , however , the senators struggled to pin Mr Galloway down with Iraqi oil sales documents with his name on them . 
`` What counts is not the names on the paper ; what counts is where is the money , senator ? '' 
`` Who paid me hundreds of thousands of dollars of money ? 
`` The answer to that is nobody . 
And if you had anybody who ever paid me a penny , you would have produced them here today . '' 
A jubilant Mr Galloway later told an American television interviewer that it marked a victory for the `` British parliamentary style '' over the more sedate senate . 
Mr Galloway used anti-war rhetoric far more raw than most politicians are accustomed to in America , where shared patriotism normally trumps outrage . 
He said that 100,000 people had paid with their lives for false assumptions on Iraq , `` 1,600 of them American soldiers sent to their deaths on a pack of lies ; 15,000 of them wounded , many of them disabled forever on a pack of lies '' . 
In their cross-examination , the senators focused on Mr Galloway 's relationship with Fawaz Zureikat , a Jordanian businessmen with extensive dealings in pre-war Iraq who served as chairman of and as principal contributor to Mr Galloway 's charity , the Mariam Appeal . 
They suggested Mr Zureikat had been oil trading in his name , and the MP must have known about it . 
Once more , the accused sought to turn the tables on his accusers . 
When Mr Coleman asked how he could have failed to be aware of Mr Zureikat 's oil deals , Mr Galloway turned the attention to Mr Coleman 's campaign fundraising . 
He said : `` Well , there 's a lot of contributors , I 've just been checking your website ... '' `` Not many at that level , Mr Galloway , '' the senator interjected . 
`` No , let me assure you there are , '' Mr Galloway went on . 
`` I 've checked your website . 
There are lots of contributors to your political campaign funds , I do n't suppose you ask any of them how they made the money they give you . '' 
Mr Coleman stuck to his task . 
`` If I can get back to Mr Zureikat one more time , do you recall a time when you specifically had a conversation with him about oil dealings in Iraq ? '' 
`` I 've already answered that question , '' Mr Galloway replied . 
`` I can assure you , Mr Zureikat never gave me a penny from an oil deal , from a cake deal , from a bread deal or from any deal . '' 
He danced around many of the questions , frequently responding , `` I can do better than that '' and answering a slightly different question . 
His biggest stumble came when he mistakenly assumed Mr Levin had backed the war . 
Mr Levin 's investigation of the US government 's own failure to police sanctions provided Mr Galloway ammunition for his counter-attack . 
But he made no more headway than his Republican counterpart in his cross-examination of the witness . 
When Mr Levin invited Mr Galloway to say whether he was alleging the documentary evidence was forged , the British MP replied : `` Well , I have no way of knowing , sir . '' 
`` That 's fine . 
So you 're not alleging , '' Mr Levin persisted . 
`` I have no way of knowing . '' 
`` Is it fair to say , since you do n't know , you 're not alleging ? '' 
`` Well , it would have been nice to have seen it before today , '' Mr Galloway said . 
The minuet of exchanges played on for another few minutes before the senators gave up frustrated . 
They had come equipped for a trial and found themselves in the role of stooges for a man accustomed to playing to the gallery .

Photograph : Dennis Cook\/AP Whatever else you made of him , when it came to delivering sustained barrages of political invective , you had to salute his indefatigability . 
George Galloway stormed up to Capitol Hill yesterday morning for the confrontation of his career , firing scatter-shot insults at the senators who had accused him of profiting illegally from Iraqi oil sales . 
They were `` neo-cons '' and `` Zionists '' and a `` pro-war lynch mob '' , he raged , who belonged to a `` lickspittle Republican committee '' that was engaged in creating `` the mother of all smokescreens '' . 
Before the hearing began , the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow even had some scorn left over to bestow generously upon the pro-war writer Christopher Hitchens . 
`` You 're a drink-soaked former Trotskyist popinjay , '' Mr Galloway in formed him . 
`` Your hands are shaking . 
You badly need another drink , '' he added later , ignoring Mr Hitchens 's questions and staring intently ahead . 
`` And you 're a drink-soaked ... '' Eventually Mr Hitchens gave up . 
`` You 're a real thug , are n't you ? '' 
he hissed , stalking away . 
It was a hint of what was to come : not so much political theater as political bloodsports - and with the senators , at least , it was Mr Galloway who emerged with the flesh between his teeth . 
`` I know that standards have slipped in Washington in recent years , but for a lawyer , you 're remarkably cavalier with any idea of justice , '' he told Norm Coleman , the Minnesota Republican who chairs the senate investigations committee , after taking his seat at the front of the high-ceilinged hearing room , and swearing an oath to tell the truth . 
`` I 'm here today , but last week you already found me guilty . 
You traduced my name around the world without ever having asked me a single question . '' 
The culture clash between Mr Galloway 's bruising style and the soporific gentility of senate proceedings could hardly have been more pronounced , and drew audible gasps and laughs of disbelief from the audience . 
`` I met Saddam Hussein exactly the same number of times as Donald Rumsfeld met him , '' Mr Galloway went on . 
`` The difference is that Donald Rumsfeld met him to sell him guns , and to give him maps the better to target those guns . '' 
American reporters seemed as fascinated as the British media : at one point yesterday , before it was his turn to speak , Mr Galloway strode from the room , sending journalists of all nationalities rushing after him - only to discover that he was going to the lavatory . 
By condemning him in their report without interviewing him , the senators had already given Mr Galloway the upper hand . 
But not everything was in his favor . 
For a start , only two senators were present , sabotaging Mr Galloway 's efforts to attack the whole lickspittle lot of them - and one of the two , the Democrat Carl Levin , had spent much of his opening statement attacking the hypocrisy of the US government in allegedly allowing American firms to benefit from Iraqi oil corruption . 
Even so , Mr Galloway was in his element , playing the role he relishes the most : the little guy squaring up for a fight with the establishment . 
For these purposes , Senator Coleman served symbolically to represent all the evil in the world - the entire Republican party , the conscience of George Bush , the US government and the British government , too : no wonder his weak smile looked so nauseous . 
`` I gave my heart and soul to stop you committing the disaster that you did commit in invading Iraq ... senator , in everything I said about Iraq , I turned out to be right and you turned out to be wrong , '' Mr Galloway told him . 
And yet for all his anti-establishment credentials , Mr Galloway is as practiced as any of his New Labor enemies at squirming away from awkward questions . 
Under scrutiny by Senator Levin , he deployed a classic example of the bait-and-switch technique that is the government minister 's best defense in difficult questioning . 
But Mr Galloway Goes To Washington had never really been an exercise in clarifying the facts . 
It was an exercise in giving Norm Coleman , and , by extension , the Bush administration , a black eye - mere days after the bloody nose that the Respect MP took credit for having given Tony Blair . 
And it went as well as Mr Galloway could have wished .

2005-05-19,"Sparks fly in Washington , but doubts remain Thursday 19 May 2005 02.15 BST Daily Record Editorial , Scotland May 18 `` Love him or loathe him , no one can doubt George Galloway has got guts - and he 's got a point . 
-LRB- On Tuesday -RRB- he went to the US senate and delivered his own attack of shock and awe on the senators who claim he traded oil for Saddam Hussein . 
`` But he did something more important than just have his day in court to clear his name ... He asked the questions the senators have ignored . 
Such as what happened to $ 8bn worth of Iraqi oil produced in the 14 months when the US ran Iraq ? 
Such as how many billions of dollars have American multinationals such as Halliburton pocketed for their work in Iraq ? 
Such as did that company get the contract because the US vice-president , Dick Cheney , used to be a senior executive with them ? 
... At the end of the day , there are bigger questions about the war in Iraq than the role of Mr Galloway . 
-LRB- On Tuesday -RRB- he managed to pose some of them . '' 
Daily Mirror Editorial , May 18 `` Even when Daniel was in the lion 's den , he did n't humiliate and torment the lion . 
But that 's what Mr Galloway did in Washington to the senator who accused him of making millions from Saddam oil . 
Mr Galloway not only defended himself robustly but also threw the charges back in the face of the American administration . 
The jibe which must have most stung them was when the Respect MP pointed out that their own defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , had twice met Saddam to sell him arms . '' 
Washington Times Editorial , May 18 `` Unfortunately , the most talked-about aspect of -LRB- the senate sub-committee hearings -RRB- is Mr Galloway 's vitriolic attack on the integrity of -LRB- chairman -RRB- Norm Coleman and the sub-committee , his denunciation of the war to liberate Iraq and his assertions of persecution at the hands of Zionists , Christian fundamentalist and other alleged malefactors . 
None of this is out of character for a man who has described the fall of Soviet communism as a tragedy , who openly attacked his own government for opposing Saddam and who depicts Iraq 's terrorist insurgents as liberators . 
`` Mr Galloway 's reprehensible political views aside , proving he was paid off by Saddam has been no easy task ... -LRB- But -RRB- things are becoming increasingly uncomfortable for some of Saddam 's staunchest supporters . '' 
`` Mr Galloway was able to show that the senate has found no concrete evidence showing that oil bribes ever came into his possession . 
On the other hand , his verbal gymnastics failed to answer some basic questions put to him by the senators . 
`` Specifically , he pointedly refused to distance himself from his Jordanian collaborator , Fawaz Zureikat , who was chairman of the Mariam Appeal set up by Mr Galloway ostensibly to help a four-year-old girl suffering from leukemia . 
Much of the cash that went into the appeal came from Mr Zureikat . 
The Americans claim to have solid evidence that Mr Zureikat was involved in questionable oil trading . 
However , Mr Galloway refused to condemn Mr Zureikat and instead blustered about the corruption of US politics . 
Mr Galloway can not have it both ways . '' 
Herald Editorial , Scotland , May 18 `` The committee wanted to know why Mr Galloway had taken money from Mr Zureikat ... for the appeal . 
Did Mr Galloway know Mr Zureikat was dealing with Saddam and might have been given kickbacks from selling oil , they asked ... `` The onus is on the senate to prove its documents are genuine . 
But Mr Galloway will be unable to occupy the moral high ground with any certainty while questions concerning Mr Zureikat 's involvement , the source of his donation and his precise motivation remain unanswered . ''

2005-05-21,"Saturday 21 May 2005 00.37 BST George Bush yesterday intervened in the furore surrounding the photographs of Saddam Hussein in his underpants leaked to the Sun newspaper , saying he supported the `` aggressive '' investigation to find out how they got into the public domain . 
The White House and Pentagon reacted with anger to publication of the pictures - apparently taken more than a year ago - claiming they violated military guidelines and possibly the Geneva convention . 
A White House spokesman said the president had been briefed by aides and `` strongly supports the aggressive and thorough investigation that is already under way '' . 
Kalil al-Duleimi , Saddam 's lawyer in Iraq , told the Guardian : `` If these photographs are authentic , then they represent a clear and blatant violation of all moral and human rights principals . 
They are a flagrant violation of the Geneva conventions concerning prisoners of war and my client is a war prisoner . '' 
But the Sun defended its decision to publish . 
`` This is a man who breached the Geneva convention more times than you 've had hot dinners , so please do n't talk to us about the Geneva convention , '' the managing editor , Graham Dudman , told MediaGuardian . 
`` I would defy any newspaper that got these photographs and knew they were genuine not to publish them . '' 
The Sun 's front page , headlined Tyrant 's in His Pants , showed Saddam , dressed only in baggy white Y-fronts . 
Other grainy pictures inside showed him sleeping and sitting in a red plastic chair washing his trousers . 
The newspaper claimed the pictures were taken at the `` top secret location '' in Iraq where the former dictator is being held while awaiting trial for genocide . 
It said Saddam was constantly monitored by three CCTV cameras to make sure he does not commit suicide . 
It is unclear whether the pictures were taken from that footage . 
The New York Post , which like the Sun is owned by Rupert Murdoch , also ran the pictures in later editions under the headline Butcher of Sagdad . 
The Sun refused to say how it got hold of the pictures , insisting it needed to protect its sources . 
It also took the unusual step of writing to rival news organizations saying they owned the worldwide syndication rights . 
News International , the company that owns the newspaper , is said to be demanding # 20,000 a photo . 
It is thought the military has been able to date the pictures because Saddam began growing a beard about 12 months ago . 
In the pictures he is clean-shaven . 
In its story the Sun cited military sources saying they handed over the pictures showing Saddam as `` an ageing and humble old man '' in the hope of dealing a blow to the resistance in Iraq . 
`` It 's important that the people of Iraq see him like that to destroy the myth , '' the paper 's source was quoted as saying . 
But Lieutenant Colonel Steven Boylan , a senior US army public affairs officer in Baghdad , told the Guardian : `` The photographs were definitely not released by multinational forces in Iraq . '' 
Fears were voiced in the US that the publication of the pictures would further inflame hostilities towards US forces . 
But at a press conference Mr Bush said : `` I do n't think a photo inspires murderers . 
I think they 're inspired by an ideology that is so barbaric and backwards that it 's hard for many in the western world to comprehend how they think . '' 
In Baghdad , the photographs were broadcast on the al-Arabiya satellite channel , but appeared to have little immediate impact . 
Jamal Hussein , a student at Baghdad University , said : `` Who wants to look at pictures of old men in their underwear ? '' 
Saddam was captured in December 2003 while hiding in a hole in the ground near his home town of Tikrit , 80 miles north of Baghdad . 
No date has been set for his trial .

2005-05-22,"In 1977 an iconic fantasy film was released . 
The cycle is now complete , but the legend is going out with a whimper Directed by George Lucas . 
Starring Ewan McGregor , Hayden Christensen The phenomenon that is Star Wars began in 1977 with a cheerful action film derived from Flash Gordon , The Wizard of Oz , Triumph of the Will and Japanese samurai movies . 
It reflected the mood of a nation emerging from the debacle of the Vietnam War and the betrayal of the Watergate scandal . 
Sub-titled ' A New Hope ' the movie centred on a trio of young people with the counsel of an elder restoring democracy to their shattered galaxy . 
Two sequels followed , neither directed by its producer and only begetter , George Lucas , each of which was supposedly deeper and darker , though many thought they merely added sententiousness and whimsy . 
At that midway point a new American President , Ronald Reagan , took up the trilogy as a national propaganda weapon , drawing on Star Wars mythology to characterise the Soviet Union as ` the evil empire ' and the film 's title was borrowed for his proposed space missile-defence system . 
Now , more than three decades since Lucas conceived it , his project has been completed by the third of three prequels , Star Wars Episode III : Revenge of the Sith , which ends by disappearing up the black hole of what is now designated Star Wars Episode IV . 
It emerges in the wake of 11 September and the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , and more or less reflects that state of permanent war imagined by George Orwell , waged by a single authoritarian superpower . 
This wily government uses the threat of outside terror to maintain its power and manipulating democratic processes . 
` In the Jedi Council we 're making finding General Grievous our first priority , ' proclaims a sonorous Samuel L Jackson , and we are invited to hear an echo of Colin Powell declaring war on Osama Bin Laden . 
Over this period , Lucas has created his own empire with his Industrial Light and Magic company , and his two old friends from the carefree days of the 1970s , Francis Coppola and Steven Spielberg , have also created their own studios -LRB- though the former subsequently lost his -RRB- . 
Lucas has been accused of selling out , of contributing to the dumbing down of audiences world-wide . 
He 's also been claimed as one of the saviors of Hollywood and popular cinema at a time when the theatrical movie seemed on its way to art-house extinction . 
The charges and claims are both true . 
This having been said , Star Wars : Revenge of the Sith is n't much of a movie . 
The anagramatically inviting name of its villains readily suggests another sub-title , ` This Shit Hits ' . 
Its whole purpose is to explain how the Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker -LRB- Hayden Christensen -RRB- deserted the forces of light to join ` the dark side of the force ' and eventually turns into the masked , bionic warrior of what we now call Episodes IV , V and VI . 
It 's not much of a struggle . 
He is easily conned by the wicked Chancellor Palpatine into becoming a double agent . 
He gets miffed when he 's refused promotion to Jedi Master -LRB- rejection and humiliation are frequent factors in driving political leaders to the bad -RRB- ; and he finally makes a Faustian bargain to save the life of a loved one . 
There was an element of suspense in the earlier Star Wars films . 
We wondered where Darth Vader came from and what was his relationship to young Luke Skywalker . 
That has long since gone , being wholly dispelled by the prequels . 
Special effects have greatly advanced since 1978 , but technology needs imagination after it has made an initial impression . 
Imagination is not the strong suit of Revenge of the Sith . 
This new century has brought us the Lord of the Rings trilogy , which has a dramatic drive and an emotional sweep that some feel border on the spiritual . 
Peter Jackson 's films overshadow Lucas 's new picture and its ersatz mythology . 
Star Wars III aims to raise serious moral issues but never transcends the banality of evil . 
Its dialogue , combining the pretentious and the flat-footed , expresses the banality of drivel . 
Indifferently directed , the performers can do little with the material . 
The exception is Ian McDiarmid as the evil Palpatine who shows Anakin how to scowl from under his cowl and become one of the boys in the hood . 
All this compares rather poorly with Lucas 's other series , the Indiana Jones trilogy , featuring a key figure of the earlier Star Wars pictures , Harrison Ford . 
In what is also a nostalgic entertainment modelled on Saturday morning serials , Jones confronts - at least in two of his outings - genuine forces of evil , Hitler and the Nazis . 
In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade , Indie , like Anakin Skywalker , has to make a life-and-death decision . 
In order to save his father 's life , he must help the evil powers obtain the Holy Grail , but unlike Anakin he knows how to play a canny game . 
Although Lucas appointed others to make a TV series about the young Indiana Jones , he restricted himself in the cinema to a short prequel segment about the teenage Indie , explaining his troubled relations with his father and how he came to be the way he was . 
It is a witty , sparkling 15-minute sequence tucked into the opening of The Last Crusade , not three solemn movies made over a period of five years .

2005-05-23,"His speech to the troops on the eve of the Iraq war made Colonel Tim Collins a national hero and media star . 
But his fame earned him enemies and accusations from both media and military . 
Now that he has cleared his name he is rebutting his critics and looking to a future outside the army The famous speech Colonel Tim Collins made on the eve of the second Gulf war still reads pretty well . 
`` We are going to Iraq to liberate and not to conquer . 
We will not fly our flags in their country ... The only flag that will be flown in that ancient land is their own ... Iraq is steeped in history ; it is the site of the Garden of Eden , of the Great Flood and the birthplace of Abraham . 
Tread lightly there . '' 
Two years on , however , the liberators\/conquerors -LRB- delete according to taste -RRB- are still treading far from lightly - and Collins ' distinguished army career is over , one of the more curious casualties of the war . 
Collins left the army in April 2004 , on the day he received an OBE for distinguished service . 
It was the end of a 22-year love affair , and he traces the waning of the romance to the speech a year earlier . 
`` The problems started at the point where newspapers began to portray me as a coming leader , '' he says . 
`` The army does n't like that . 
They decide who 's going to be in charge . 
I think it was a case of , ` He may do many things , but one thing he will never do is lead the army . 
He 's not even going to run a bath in future ' . '' 
The speech was made just before the 1st battalion of the Royal Irish Regiment , which Collins commanded , crossed into Iraq . 
It was extemporised and would have been lost in the sands but for the quick thinking -LRB- and even quicker shorthand -RRB- of Sarah Oliver , a Mail on Sunday journalist embedded with the unit . 
Her transcript went round the world , was supposedly pinned to the wall of the Oval Office and inspired a letter to the colonel from Prince Charles , who said how profoundly -LRB- the letter is in Collins ' study and the word has been underlined by the prince -RRB- moved he had been by the stirring , caring words . 
How did he produce so fluent an address , such Churchillian cadences , without notes ? 
`` Somehow it does just come to you , '' he says . 
`` Come the time , come the moment . 
How do Irish heroes find the words on the gallows steps ? 
They just come to you . '' 
He still gets requests for a recording or footage of the speech , but none exists , which must give the Sky team who were also embedded with the battalion pause for thought . 
Early in our conversation the colonel calls the speech `` ill-advised '' , but he is joking - he has a taste for irony . 
He is proud to have made it . 
`` The war had gone off ahead of time and everyone was wondering when the first scuds would start landing , '' he recalls . 
`` It was all very edgy . 
For the first time I was certain there was going to be a war , and I was conscious that I was going to be asking young men to take human life . 
That 's a big step and perhaps some of them had n't considered it . 
Having served in many conflicts , I also had no expectation , even with a miracle , of bringing everyone home alive . 
So I knew for a lot of these young people that this was the final chapter in their lives , and I wanted to explain to them why it was important , why they were there , why this was happening . '' 
In the event , there was a miracle - none of his battalion were killed . 
How did his men respond to his message ? 
`` They heard and understood exactly what I 'd said and behaved impeccably -LRB- during the war -RRB- . 
They made a huge contribution in the areas where they were and made it a better place . 
In the short time -LRB- less than two months -RRB- we were there , we made a difference . 
For instance , within a week of us arriving , the city of Al Amarah had water , light , the sewage was under control , there were policemen on the streets and the fire brigades were working . 
It 's now one of the most violent places in Iraq . '' 
Collins would defend his regiment 's role to the last ditch . 
But he makes no attempt to defend the war itself . 
`` I went with the Irish to Iraq with the intention of liberating the Iraqis , with the cry that ` small nations can be free ' . 
But what is happening there is much more reminiscent of American policy than British colonial policy . 
Love it or hate it , British colonial policy is about acting in partnership with the people you come across for mutual benefit . 
American policy is all about subjugation . 
My view is that we were sold a dummy . '' 
Alongside pictures of Collins in battle fatigues - steel-grey hair , shades , flash watch , huge cigar - the speech encapsulated how we , the media , the public , wanted to see our commanders : as larger-than-life heroes . 
While not averse to grandiloquent gestures - he is puffing on a vast cigar when we meet in the garden of his new detached house in Whitstable , Kent , and there is a Mercedes sports car with the roof down on the drive - he does not accept the hero tag . 
`` I 'm not a hero . 
If there are heroes it 's the collective men of the Royal Irish Regiment . 
They are the heroes because it was their actions and their proficiency , hard won on many operations , that made us a success . '' 
The army certainly did n't treat him as a hero . 
They disliked his public persona and vigorously pursued a series of war crimes allegations made against him by a US major with whom he had crossed swords in Iraq and even more serious allegations by the Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror , which accused his battalion of murdering Iraqis in cold blood and burying the bodies in shallow graves . 
A commission of inquiry eventually exonerated him on all charges , but in a memoir published today he is scathing about the way he was abandoned - worse , undermined - by the organization to which he had devoted his life . 
`` The army was attacking me with anonymous briefings , '' he alleges in the book . 
`` It had unwittingly made me the British Dreyfus . '' 
He is sure he knows who in the army high command was out to get him , but says he has insufficient evidence to name him . 
Collins was awarded damages against the Sunday Express and Sunday Mirror - he is building a gazebo in the garden with the proceeds - and has no intention of being on the losing side in the libel lottery . 
`` When the war crimes allegations were made , '' he says , `` for some in the high command they were like a gift from God and they pursued them with the utmost vigor . 
I know who was ultimately behind the whole thing , but I do n't have documentary proof . 
He is a general who has never even been in a fight in a playground and feels hugely threatened by combat soldiers . 
He moved heaven and earth to get me . '' 
I tell Collins that he reminds me of the late Colonel David Hackworth , the much-decorated Vietnam commander who was supposedly the model for Colonel Kilgore in Apocalypse Now . 
He says he is currently reading Hackworth 's autobiography , About Face , and admits to seeing parallels in their careers : battlefield heroes who then turned their fire on their deskbound superiors -LRB- Hackworth called them `` perfumed princes '' -RRB- . 
Can armies , underpinned by discipline , simply not accommodate mavericks in the long term ? 
`` I think the army will accommodate people like me , '' says Collins , `` but is n't able to just at the moment . 
What we have essentially is the army being led by people who were brought up in the cold war when the most important thing in their calendar was the Rhine army horse show . 
They 're now finding it very difficult to cope with the fact that the army is at war -LRB- with terrorism -RRB- . '' 
The key to understanding Collins may be that his attachment was to his beloved Royal Irish Regiment -LRB- formerly the Royal Irish Rangers -RRB- first ; the British army a distant second . 
His home is filled with regimental memorabilia - there is even a Rangers badge in the loo . 
Thin-lipped English officers who criticised him for putting himself in the frontline too much failed to understand his Irishness and the way it conditioned his passionate leadership . 
`` The Irish way is to be in the frontline , '' he says . 
`` Why have an Irish regiment if you do n't expect them to behave like paddies ? 
Our military culture in Ireland has n't changed in a thousand years . 
They still expect their chieftain to lead from the front . '' 
Attachment to the Royal Irish runs in Collins ' family : his grandfather and an uncle were both in the regiment and his grandfather 's first world war medals are proudly displayed in a case mounted on the wall . 
Collins himself was an army cadet at 11 , joined the Territorials at 17 and was commissioned into the army at 21 . 
His father , a Dubliner who set up a printer 's shop in Belfast , could n't join up because he was hard of hearing . 
His mother was a devout presbyterian , and from her perhaps Collins has derived faith , belief in social order and a loathing of discrimination . 
He says that at Queen 's University , Belfast , where he studied economics , most of his friends were nationalists . 
Stripped from his beloved regiment , Collins cuts an odd figure . 
A less colonel-like person you could not meet . 
He is wearing jeans , sandals , a bronze bracelet , one of those fashionable wristbands -LRB- a green `` support our troops '' one -RRB- , and a perfect white T-shirt that shows off his almost flat stomach and muscular arms . 
He is 45 , but far fitter than he was 10 years ago : the photographs in the lounge show a flabbier , less dashing officer , with brown hair and an old-fashioned haircut . 
He is amiable but a little detached , with steely-blue eyes that only occasionally settle on you . 
Mostly , he is speaking into the middle-distance , lecturing on grand themes , speaking to some unseen army . 
He wants so much to be taken seriously - as a thinker on Northern Irish politics -LRB- he foresees a political realignment -RRB- , third world aid -LRB- he 's been there - largely pointless -RRB- , state education -LRB- `` beyond repair '' -RRB- , and global affairs . 
He recognizes that he has now reached a fork in the road . 
He was courted by Conservative and Unionist politicians and does n't rule out standing for parliament in the future , but wants to get experience of life outside the army first . 
He is also hoping to present a television series on army history . 
His home is like a military museum - pity any burglar who tries to take on this super-fit former SAS man with his large collection of Gurkha knives - and you wonder how he will negotiate a fresh beginning outside the army . 
Will he ever free himself from the shadow of that speech ? 
`` Hopefully I will do other things in my life and it will become just a one-hit wonder , a bit like the birdie song , '' he jokes . 
But , in truth , he accepts that Ms Oliver 's excellent shorthand will provide the inscription on his tombstone . 
`` I 'm sure when I drop off my perch at whatever age , the great speech will come back in the obituaries . 
The moment it happened , it changed my life and nothing would ever be the same again . 
But war is like that . 
It changes everything and you can never go back to the time before . ''

2005-05-25,"Wednesday 25 May 2005 00.02 BST It was a culinary rebuke that echoed around the world , heightening the sense of tension between Washington and Paris in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq . 
But now the US politician who led the campaign to change the name of french fries to `` freedom fries '' has turned against the war . 
Walter Jones , the Republican congressman for North Carolina who was also the brains behind french toast becoming freedom toast in Capitol Hill restaurants , told a local newspaper the US went to war `` with no justification '' . 
Mr Jones , who in March 2003 circulated a letter demanding that the three cafeterias in the House of Representatives ' office buildings ban the word french from menus , said it was meant as a `` light-hearted gesture '' . 
But the name change , still in force , made headlines around the world , both for what it said about US-French relations and its pettiness . 
Now Mr Jones appears to agree . 
Asked by a reporter for the North Carolina News and Observer about the name-change campaign - an idea Mr Jones said at the time came to him by a combination of God 's hand and a constituent 's request - he replied : `` I wish it had never happened . '' 
Although he voted for the war , he has since become one of its most vociferous opponents on Capitol Hill , where the hallway outside his office is lined with photographs of the `` faces of the fallen '' . 
`` If we were given misinformation intentionally by people in this administration , to commit the authority to send boys , and in some instances girls , to go into Iraq , that is wrong , '' he told the newspaper . 
`` Congress must be told the truth . ''

2005-05-27,"Jailed militia leader counselled ex-foes Friday 27 May 2005 00.01 BST When Sheikh Ali Bapir saw his fellow prisoners at the US-run detention center near Baghdad airport he was angry . 
They were the men he had fought against most of his life . 
Now he was in prison with them . 
He knew their faces from TV : Ali Hassan al-Majid , aka Chemical Ali , the alleged mastermind of gas attacks on the Kurds and of the brutal suppression of the Shia ; Taha Yassin Ramadan , the former Iraqi vice-president and a confidante of Saddam Hussein ; Tariq Aziz , the former deputy prime minister in the Ba'athist regime ; and Barzan al-Tikriti , Saddam 's half-brother . 
In the near distance , separated from the others by a barbed wire fence , was Saddam . 
Released without charge at the end of last month after 22 months in custody , Sheikh Ali , 44 , the leader of the Komala Islami Kurdistan -LRB- Kurdistan Islamic group -RRB- , spoke to the Guardian about his encounters with the former Iraqi leadership . 
`` Why did you put me in here with criminals and mass murderers ? '' 
he would ask of his interrogators . 
`` I have never been a Ba'athist and I am not a terrorist . 
I even killed my brother because he spied for the Iraqi intelligence . '' 
But as the weeks progressed , he channelled his rage into pity and became a spiritual guide to the ex-Ba ` athist leaders , teaching them the Qur ` an and leading them in prayer . 
`` At first I was hostile to them , '' he said . 
`` What they did to my people and the Iraqi people in general was not to be forgiven . 
But they were also in prison and in a weak position . 
It was my duty under Islam to show mercy , even to these people who had never shown mercy to others . '' 
Sheikh Ali was reluctant to talk about individuals but said many of the former leaders looked like `` broken men '' . 
His sermons and counselling had an effect . 
`` Some of them did recognize their mistakes . 
Some of them told me they would go to their cells and open the Qur ` an and cry because now they made sense of what they did and how horrifying were the results of their actions . '' 
Saddam was in a separate part of the prison , and even though the sheikh could see him , they never spoke . 
Before the war , Sheikh Ali and his 3,000 followers were based in the Kurdish town of Khormal . 
Like many political leaders who fought against the regime , he also commanded a militia - of about 1,000 men - which controlled a mountain area of north-eastern Iraq close to the Iranian border . 
Sheikh Ali opposed terrorism and advocated ties with the west . 
But his territory abutted the region controlled by the mili tant group Ansar al-Islam . 
Sheikh Ali was accused of helping the group by allowing Ansar 's guerrillas to take refuge in his areas . 
In the first days of the war to remove Saddam , US cruise missiles hit his two-storey compound , killing 43 of his followers and wounding at least 50 . 
The Americans apologised later but offered no compensation . 
In July 2003 he arranged to meet US officers at a hotel in the lakeside resort of Dukan to ask for compensation but was arrested on his way there . 
He was flown to Mosul , where he was told he had been arrested on four counts : of planning to attack US forces ; of helping Ansar al-Islam ; of having links to the previous Ba'athist regime ; and of having relations with Iran . 
`` I told them that the charges were baseless and asked them to produce evidence . 
They were clearly clueless about my participation in the resistance to Saddam , and about my pronouncements against Ansar , '' he said . 
Sheikh Ali had broadly supported the war to remove Saddam . 
For the first nine days he was interrogated `` perhaps 50 times , day or night '' , after which he was transferred to the prison containing `` high value detainees '' . 
He said he was tortured but refused to go into details . 
`` I do n't want to explain . 
I will only tell you the consequences of the torture . 
When I went to prison my weight was 75kg -LRB- 165lbs -RRB- but after nine days I had lost 15kg . 
and my heartbeat was very quick . 
I told everything to the Red Cross . '' 
His prison cell was 2.5 metres by 2.5 metres -LRB- 8ft by 8ft -RRB- . 
`` It had a bed , a blanket , a big strong door , and no windows . 
Much of the time there was no electricity , no lights , '' he said . 
`` At the beginning I spent 23 hours inside my cell . '' 
After several months , he was allowed out of his cell for longer periods . 
`` During the break , we would pace along an open-air corridor , '' he said . 
`` For the first four months we were not even allowed to say hello to other prisoners ; we had to keep our distance by a few metres from them . 
If we broke those rules they would take away our exercise privileges . '' 
Later the rules were relaxed . 
`` They gave us chairs so we could sit next to each other and talk to each other , '' he said . 
He received his first letter seven months after his arrest but was not allowed a phone call until a year later . 
There were no newspapers . 
`` We got some information from our guards , '' he said . 
`` For example I knew when Saddam arrived . 
And I used to see him when he was being taken to the doctor . 
The guards told me that he talked big words , but that he was often depressed . '' 
The Americans gradually began to understand Sheikh Ali was not a security risk and allowed him to teach classes in religion to the other inmates . 
He described a senior former regime figure who had broken his arm after falling in the shower , and `` was very down , and needed spiritual sustenance '' . 
Some of those he spoke to denied knowledge of the regime 's campaign against the Kurdish areas in the late 1980s , during which 180,000 Kurds were killed . 
`` Some said they did know but it was just a few villages that had been destroyed . '' 
`` One claimed Iraq was not responsible for Halabja -LRB- where 5,000 Kurds were gassed -RRB- , but that it was the Iranians . '' 
After six months of interrogation , the American interrogators were replaced by two Britons . 
`` They informed me immediately that they knew the accusations against me were baseless , '' he said . 
`` But they also informed me that I would be kept in prison for as long as the interests of US national security demanded . '' 
Then one day in April , the director of the prison stores came to him and told him he would soon `` be traveling '' . 
`` It was strange to be told this by the stores manager and not the interrogation officers . 
Perhaps they were somehow ashamed . '' 
The next day he was asked to sign a form , promising to renounce Ba'athism and not mix with Ba'athists after his release . 
`` I told them I 'd prefer to go back to jail than sign this paper , '' he said . 
`` It would darken my name . 
It would be like accepting that I was a Ba'athist . '' 
Now Sheikh Ali hopes to convince Islamists to renounce violence . 
He regards the suicide bombers in Iraq as being foreigners who are `` ignorant '' of Iraq and Islam . 
`` The Qur ` an says it is wrong for even one innocent Muslim to be killed among 100 guilty people , '' he said . 
`` Killing an innocent policeman or other people who are just job seekers is not Islamic . '' 
He also hopes to be able to help convince the west of the mistakes it has made with the Islamic world . 
`` When I was in prison I tried to tell the Americans not to always engage the Islamic world through a process of conflict , '' he said . 
`` It 's like spring water . 
You should allow this spring water to come out from the ground in a natural way . 
But if you try to push it and oppress it , it will take another course and come out of the ground in a very unnatural way . ''

2005-05-27,"` Father ' of Malaysia savages Bush and Blair Mahathir brands US a rogue nation terrorising innocents and stands by claim that Jews ` rule the world by proxy ' Mahathir Mohamad , modern Malaysia 's founding father and moderate Islam 's self-styled champion , denounced the Bush administration yesterday as a `` rogue regime '' bent on terrorising innocent civilians . 
He also said he was disappointed that Tony Blair , who he called a `` proven liar '' , had won re-election after joining the US invasion of Iraq . 
Reflecting the rage felt across the Muslim world over abuse scandals in Afghanistan and Guantnamo Bay , and continuing violence in Palestine and Iraq , Mr Mahathir said President George Bush and other US politicians were `` ignorant '' people who believed might made right - a return to colonial-era `` old thinking '' . 
Speaking to the Guardian at his offices in Putrajaya , near Kuala Lumpur , Mr Mahathir also claimed that the Israeli government had been given a free hand by Washington to continue to expropriate Palestinian land and entrench its control over Jerusalem . 
The war on terror would not end until the Middle East conflict was justly resolved , he said . 
Asked whether he regretted his statement that `` Jews rule the world by proxy '' , which caused an international furore in 2003 , Mr Mahathir said he took nothing back . 
`` US politicians are scared stiff of the Jews because anybody who votes against the Jews will lose elections . 
The Jews in America are supporting the Jews in Israel . 
Israel and other Jews control the most powerful nation in the world . 
And that is what I mean -LRB- about Jews controlling the world -RRB- . 
I stand by that view . '' 
On his balcony overlooking the tower blocks , mosques , bridges and artificial lakes of Putrajaya , Malaysia 's new administrative capital which he created in the 1990s , Mr Mahathir , 79 , cuts a slight , almost self-effacing figure . 
His personal manner is reserved and courteous to a fault . 
Earlier in the day , he had lectured students at his Perdana Leadership Foundation on the importance of education and development in the Muslim world to defend the Islamic faith . 
The problem was not Islam itself , he said , but the many incorrect interpreta tions of the Qur ` an that were exploited by extremists . 
`` Islam is a positive , not a negative force . 
Today most Muslim countries seem incapable of developing good governments , they are always fighting each other , assassinating each other and doing all the wrong things . '' 
Distortions of the Prophet 's teachings had held back the peoples of many Muslim countries , he said . 
But Mr Mahathir 's strongest criticism was directed outwards . 
Even though he retired as Malaysia 's longest-serving prime minister in 2003 , many in the region still regard him as the country 's leader and one of Asia 's most influential voices . 
His anger is undimmed ; his rhetoric flows unstaunched . 
`` The US is the most powerful nation , '' he said . 
`` It can ignore the world if it wants to do anything . 
It breaks international law . 
It arrests people outside their countries ; it charges them under American law . 
`` The US war on terror is a way of terrorising people . 
If you are an Iraqi and you are expecting to be bombed , are n't you terrified ? 
If you have done nothing , if you are an innocent Iraqi citizen and you are expecting any time a rocket to fly in and blow you to pieces , are n't you terrified ? 
`` That is terror -LRB- and -RRB- the US is as guilty of terrorism as the people who crashed their planes into the buildings ... Bush does n't understand the rest of the world . 
He thinks everybody should be a neocon like him . '' 
Mr Mahathir was equally scathing about Israeli policies in Palestine . 
He said his visit to the West Bank last month had been deliberately disrupted by the Israeli government . 
Specifically , he said he was blocked from traveling to Jerusalem and Jenin , scene of some of the worst Israeli violence in 2002 , where he was to open a school funded by Malaysia . 
Israel has denied impeding his visit . 
`` I suppose I was mistaken in thinking that there are parts of Palestine that are under the control of the Palestinians . 
But apparently the Israelis have occupied the whole of Palestine . 
They do anything they like there , '' he said . 
Mr Blair had discredited himself and Britain in Muslim eyes by backing the Iraq war , Mr Mahathir said . 
`` He was wrong and he was more wrong because he tells lies . 
You know , Jack Straw came to see me -LRB- on the eve of the war in January 2003 -RRB- and I asked him , ` Why are you with the Americans ? ' 
He said we 're trying to influence the Americans not to take that kind of action . 
But it seems it was the other way round . 
`` They -LRB- Britain -RRB- were influenced in supporting America to do something that they knew was wrong ... They knew they were being lied to , and yet they supported the Americans and today 300,000 Iraqis are dead because of these lies . 
`` I think a person like Blair would feel very guilty and I am disappointed that the British people would re-elect a person who obviously told lies ... We 're beginning to lose faith in the present leadership of Britain . '' 
One eventual consequence , he suggested , could be Malaysia 's withdrawal from the Commonwealth . 
Malaysia , which is encircled by conflicts in western Indonesia , the Philippines and southern Thailand , fully supported the fight against religious and political fanaticism , he said . 
But the west was going about it the wrong way . 
`` Even if you get Bin Laden , you ca n't be sure there wo n't be another Bin Laden . 
You can not get terrorists to sign a peace treaty . 
The only way to beat terror is to go for the basic causes . 
`` They do n't blow themselves up for no reason , they 're angry , they 're frustrated . 
And why are they angry ? 
Look at the Palestinian situation . 
Fifty years after you created the state of Israel , things are going from bad to worse . 
`` If you do n't settle that , there will be no end to the war on terror . 
For how long are you going to go on examining people 's shoes ? ''

2005-05-28,"Nicholas Lezard on Eliot Weinberger 's What I Heard About Iraq , a simple but effective anti-war commentary What I Heard About Iraq , by Eliot Weinberger -LRB- Verso , # 7.99 -RRB- Every war has its classic anti-war book ; and here , you might think , is Iraq 's . 
It is a very simple and straightforward idea . 
It consists of about 250 paragraphs -LRB- this is a very rough count indeed -RRB- , over about 70 pages -LRB- that 's a bit more accurate -RRB- , each beginning , or almost beginning , with the words `` I heard '' . 
So , for example : `` I heard Donald Rumsfeld say that there was ` no question ' that American troops would be ` welcomed ' : ` Go back to Afghanistan , the people were in the streets playing music , cheering , flying kites , and doing all the things that the Taliban and al-Qaida would not let them do . ' '' 
And , 40-odd pages later : `` I heard a reporter say to Donald Rumsfeld : ` Before the war in Iraq , you ... said they would welcome us with open arms . ' 
And I heard Rumsfeld interrupt him : ` Never said that . 
You may remember it well , but you 're thinking of somebody else . 
You ca n't find , anywhere , me saying anything like those things you just said I said . ' '' 
Eliot Weinberger is a poet , essayist and translator -LRB- most notably of Octavio Paz -RRB- . 
I have often thought that your best bet , if you need intelligent , lapidary prose in a hurry , is to ask a poet to do it , even , or rather particularly , if it 's about politics . 
-LRB- Admittedly , this was not such a sure-fire proposal in the second world war . 
Think of Ezra Pound . -RRB- 
In 9\/12 , a meditation on the consequences of the World Trade Centre atrocity , Weinberger had already proved himself the master of the provoking juxtaposition : `` We are bombing Afghanistan because it is believed that the terrorists who attacked the Trade Centre and the Pentagon were housed and trained for their mission in Afghanistan . 
There is , as yet , no evidence for this assertion . 
What has been proven , however , is that the terrorists were housed and trained for their mission in Florida . '' 
There is little , if any , such humor in What I Heard About Iraq . 
We know more about the number of people who have died , and about the conduct of the war , and it 's not funny . 
-LRB- From the top-secret minutes of the prime minister 's meeting on July 23 2002 : Blair was told that `` military action was now seen as inevitable . 
Bush wanted to remove Saddam , through military action , justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD . 
But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy ... There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath . '' 
But we all kind of knew that all along , did n't we ? -RRB- 
But this is a very necessary book , for it presents an almost irrefutable case against the war . 
There are many people - I have , from time to time , been one of them - who , when hearing outraged conversation about the subject in our bien-pensant , brie-munching liberal circles , have preferred to go all quiet . 
After all , as PG Wodehouse said , if not about Saddam , `` slice him where you like , a hellhound is always a hellhound '' ; and there are a lot of people who are n't going to be tortured to death by his goons any more . 
-LRB- Which is why the last paragraph , depicting Saddam writing poetry , reading the Koran and placing a circle of white stones around a plum tree , is as grotesque and revolting as a photo of him in his underwear . 
It is the book 's only lapse of judgment . -RRB- 
But the folly , mendacity and vicious stupidity of the war is brought chillingly home throughout . 
The paragraphs are arranged so as to present a chronological version of what we have heard about the war . 
The rise of the reported death counts , civil and military , is particularly appalling . 
The book , understandably if frustratingly , is free of notes citing sources , but these would have marred its elegance ; and besides , we 've heard most of this stuff ourselves . 
Moreover , the `` I heard ... '' approach parodies the whole process of sexed-up rumor which supposedly justified the business in the first place . 
It is very one-sided . 
A pro-war writer could produce a mirror image - but I suspect it would be harder .

2005-05-30,"Monday 30 May 2005 23.59 BST Iraq 's religious leaders are intensifying efforts to heal the rifts between the country 's Sunnis and Shias amid a spate of sectarian killings that has raised fears of civil war . 
A weekend meeting between senior figures from the Sunni Association of Muslim Clerics and the Shia Badr Brigades - the militia of the Supreme Council of Islamic Revolution in Iraq , the biggest Shia party - sought to ease tensions caused by the killing of at least 14 Sunni clerics in the past month . 
Several Shia religious leaders and politicians have also been killed during the same period . 
It was the first of a series of face-to-face talks between the two powerful groups engineered by the Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr who is mediating in the crisis . 
Sheikh Hazem al-Araji , the head of Mr Sadr 's office in the Baghdad Shia district of Khadimiya , where the meeting took place , told the Guardian yesterday the two sides had agreed about the need `` to serve Iraq and to preserve its unity '' . 
He said another meeting would be held in the next few days and a national gathering of Sunni and Shia leaders would be called once the problems between the two organizations were resolved . 
Another of Mr Sadr 's aides , Sheikh Ghaith al-Tamimi , said : `` We want to bring about peace in Iraq and in all Iraqi cities . 
If that means organising a mass prayer of Sunni and Shia together , we 'll organise it . '' 
Relations have worsened following accusations by Sheikh Harith al-Dhari , the leader of the Sunni clerics ' association , that the Badr Brigades had orchestrated the killing of a number of prominent Sunni figures . 
Badr Brigades ' leaders denied that and in return accused Sunni clerics of failing to denounce the insurgency and of fomenting sectarian conflict . 
The fresh attempt at mediation came as news emerged of the killing of 10 Shia pilgrims as they were returning from Syria . 
At a funeral on Saturday for four of the victims in the mostly Shia city of Diwaniyah , about 100 miles south of Baghdad , mourners chanted `` revenge , revenge '' . 
It followed a week of violence across Iraq which saw a wave of car bombs , suicide attacks and assassinations aimed at mostly Shia targets . 
`` Ordinary Shia Muslims have been killed as they pray , as they marry , as they buy food , '' said Sheikh Araji . 
`` Enough is enough . 
We must defend ourselves . 
But we must not retaliate through violence . '' 
The country 's most senior Shia cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani has also urged Shias to refrain from retaliation . 
A western diplomat in Baghdad said : `` Since the fall of Saddam Hussein there has been little to no attempt at national reconciliation from the political and religious leaders . 
And unless that happens soon we may see more of see this kind of revenge killing . '' 
The interior ministry said police accepted that the killings appeared to be on the increase . 
Despite the peace talks , the Sunni Arab minority , once all-powerful but now alienated and marginalised , remain angry . 
At Friday prayers in Hassanein mosque in the west Baghdad district of Amiriya the imam , Adnan Abdul Wahab al-Ani , said : `` Saddam oppressed all Iraqi peoples without distinction , but now there is just one group being oppressed - the Sunnis . '' 
After the sermon Sheikh Ani told the Guardian : `` We are not accusing the Shia people , just the Badr Brigades ... someone is killing Sunni religious people and politicians . '' 
He said that in recent months , 152 Sunni mosques had been raided , while 14 sheikhs and 62 worshippers had been killed . 
Outside the mosque young men distributed DVDs promoting the militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi . 
In the nearby market , flyers were handed out that excoriated the `` bullshit Shia '' for cooperating with the Badr Brigades and for `` welcoming Iran into Iraq '' . 
The Badr Brigade was set up by Iraqi Shia exiles in Iran under the aegis of the Iranian government . 
One Sunni sheikh , Khalaf al-Aliyan , said Shia political parties had a hit-list targeting 4,000 Sunni Arabs but this was vehemently denied by Shia leaders .

2005-05-30,"British soldiers face war crimes charges Father tells of grief that followed death of Iraqi while in custody Monday 30 May 2005 01.58 BST After Baha Mousa died , his mother broke down every time she entered his room . 
So the family moved all his belongings out of sight and turned it into a sitting room reserved for special occasions . 
Yesterday , beneath a whirring fan his father , brothers , cousins and two young sons gathered there to hear the reports from London that up to 11 British soldiers could be prosecuted under international war crimes legislation for his death . 
It would be the first time British forces were charged under the International Criminal Court Act , a legal landmark with potentially far-reaching ramifications for future military engagements . 
`` If this brings justice , it 's a good thing , '' said his father , Daoud , 59 . 
`` They hurt him so much , they ignored his cries . 
`` My wife cries all the time . 
The trip to Baha 's grave in Najaf is long and perilous but she insists on going every few weeks . 
`` She ca n't stop thinking about him . '' 
Mr Mousa dabbed his eyes with a handkerchief and the other hand gripped a mobile phone so tightly the knuckles gleamed . 
`` Baha did everything for us . 
I think we 'll never get over it . '' 
Members of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment allegedly beat Baha Mousa , 26 , a hotel receptionist in the southern Iraqi city of Basra , to death in September 2003 . 
Four days after he was seized with six colleagues in a raid on the hotel , his father identified his battered corpse at the British military morgue . 
At least four QLR soldiers face charges of murder and abuse and yesterday it was reported that they and another seven soldiers and officers could face wider war crimes charges under legislation enacted in 2001 after the establishment of the International Criminal Court . 
The Army Prosecuting Authority has apparently yet to finalize its decision on who will be prosecuted , and on what charges , but the revelation that war crimes may be included in the charge sheet was welcomed by the victim 's father . 
The nuances of international law and legal precedent held little interest for Mr Mousa , but he hoped the development would bring justice and compensation a step closer . 
`` The punishment for the killers is for British law to decide . 
But if it was here in Iraq , and it was my choice , I would say execute them . '' 
A police colonel built like a wrestler , he spoke softly as tears rolled down his cheeks . 
On the sofa beside him , his two orphaned grandsons , Hussein , 7 , and Hassan , 5 , fidgeted and smiled , aware they were the focus of the assembled adults but unsure why . 
Hussein is the image of his father . 
He has had trouble settling into school and is hyperactive . 
Hassan resembles his mother . 
She succumbed to cancer six months before their father died . 
After that Baha would sleep between the boys . 
On monthly visits to his grave , they expect to see him and they return home to Basra disappointed and puzzled , said relatives . 
`` When they see British patrols in the streets they point and say ` Those men killed my father ' , '' said Mr Mousa . 
`` But they do n't really understand . '' 
The occupation was six months old in September 2003 and the British-controlled port city was febrile , with sporadic attacks on British forces , when the soldiers raided the Ibn Al Haitham hotel . 
They found five assault rifles and two pistols used for hotel security . 
Unable to locate their quarry , one of the hotel 's owners , they took Baha and six colleagues to the British military base . 
According to Kifah Taha , 46 , a maintenance engineer who was one of the six , beatings started immediately . 
There was a competition to see which soldier could kickbox a prisoner the furthest , he claimed . 
Each prisoner was allegedly given a footballer 's name and beaten if he failed to remember it . 
Freezing water was allegedly poured through hoods placed over their heads . 
Baha suffered the most and on the second night he was taken to another room from which Mr Taha said he could hear him moaning `` Blood . 
There 's blood coming from my nose . 
I 'm going to die . '' 
After punches and kicks , Mr Taha 's kidneys failed and he nearly died . 
He and the other five survivors were eventually released without charge . 
Backed by human rights advocacy groups , including the UK-based Iraqi League , last year the six men launched a high court challenge to the government 's refusal to order independent inquiries into the deaths . 
Back at work yesterday , fixing the hotel 's generator , Mr Taha said he still had nightmares . 
`` When I see the British in the streets , my soul leaves my body and I remember the day I was arrested . '' 
Army prosecutors have been under pressure to act since the high court ruled last December that the UK had broken the Human Rights Act by failing to prevent Mr Mousa 's death or to prosecute his alleged assailants . 
British officers have visited the family home in the Kafa hat suburb of west Basra several times to apologise . 
As a senior police officer , Baha 's father works with and respects most British soldiers . 
`` They make a good impression . 
We tackle terrorism together . '' 
But he said he rejected as an insult the offer of $ 8,000 compensation , contrasting it with the $ 10m Libya agreed to pay for each victim of the Lockerbie bombing . 
`` Is an Arab life worth so much less ? 
Are Arabs less human ? '' 
However , despite the delay in prosecuting the case , Baha 's father expressed confidence in British justice . 
`` I think everyone is under the law in your country . 
I visited London and the people were friendly , they did not like what had happened to my family . ''

2005-05-31,"Her new book about the quiet triumphs of the protest movement is designed to cheer up the left . 
Has Californian Rebecca Solnit spent too much time in the sun , or does she really offer a new way of looking at radical politics ? 
She talks to Stuart Jeffries Rebecca Solnit is content with her life , thank you very much . 
She is an anarchist activist and , by her own admission , an impecunious author . 
As a writer she resembles Naomi Klein , though probably more radical , and also Susan Sontag , though somewhat less of an aesthete . 
Solnit lives in a rent-controlled apartment in San Francisco , has no dependents and no nine-to-five job to get in the way of regular visits from the literary muse . 
That said , she says she may yet have children , but she enjoys her student-like existence too much to get tied down just yet . 
`` I decided to stop working in my editorial job in 1988 and that year has n't ended yet . 
Living below one 's means can give you a sense of freedom . '' 
Which is perhaps not something she should say too often outside the boho milieu of a literary festival . 
Surely then , I suggest , nobody should buy her new book - if we did , it would ruin her unimpeachably radical lifestyle ? 
She would probably wind up spending the proceeds on 4x4s , Ikea kitchens and Big Macs . 
`` No , people should buy my book , '' says Solnit , rather sternly . 
`` I 'll have no income in 2006 otherwise . 
I need clean socks . '' 
That book is called Hope in the Dark : The Untold History of People Power . 
It has been hailed by George Monbiot and Tony Benn , and joins two impressive books , Wanderlust : A History of Walking , and Motion Studies : Time , Space and Eadweard Muybridge , in an odd , offbeat , appealingly off-message oeuvre . 
If you were to put the new book 's philosophy on a placard , it would read : `` Oi ! 
Yes , the Iraq war had hideous consequences , but do n't forget that anti-war protests may well have stopped Bush from unleashing an even more terrible bombing of Baghdad than he did . 
What about Latin America , where dictators have been falling like ninepins ? 
Gays , women and blacks have all substantially overcome oppression ! 
True , that would make it a huge placard , but Solnit 's message is a complicated , counter - intuitive one . 
She was inspired to write Hope in the Dark following the gloom that descended over the left in the US and UK after the anti-Iraq war demonstrations in February 2003 . 
Our governments seemed to ignore popular protest , democracy seemed dead , despair the only rational political option . 
Solnit argues that it is a luxury to collapse into despair . 
She writes : `` To say that everything without exception is going straight to hell is not an alternative vision but only an inversion of the mainstream 's ` everything 's fine ' . '' 
She recalls the human rights activist and Irish nationalist Roger Casement who , when investigating torture and genocide in South America 's Putamayo rainforest , still found time to admire handsome local men and chase brilliantly colored local butterflies -LRB- or maybe it was the other way round -RRB- . 
From this , Solnit draws the following moral : `` Joy does n't betray but sustains activism . 
And when you face a politics that aspires to make you fearful , alienated and isolated , joy is a fine initial act of insurrection . '' 
`` I 'm a natural contrarian , '' she says , `` and a lot of what I felt contrary about was the griping and the finding fault that is so prevalent in some parts of the left . '' 
The book starts with an unexpectedly jaunty epigraph from that seeming arch leftwing male miserabilist , Noam Chomsky : `` The world is pretty awful today , but it is far better than yesterday , not only with regard to unwillingness to tolerate aggression , but also in many other ways , which we now tend to take for granted . '' 
Solnit similarly says that she sees a nuanced moral world of greys . 
`` It is always simplistic to see things in black and white . '' 
Is n't she just a smug , middle-class white Californian with an upbeat , post-hippyish philosophy ? 
`` I 'm certainly middle-class , white and Californian . 
I am certainly not saying that terrible things have not happened in Iraq . 
But what we forget are the things that did not happen - the wars , the diseases , the people who did n't die . '' 
Indeed , she says that she hopes to see George Bush indicted for war crimes during her lifetime . 
`` Or , more importantly , during his . '' 
Born the same year the Berlin wall went up -LRB- 1961 -RRB- , Solnit concedes that she had a strange upbringing for an American . 
`` I was floating in a kind of Laputa like in Gulliver 's Travels . 
I lived among radicals . 
I had to go to Nevada to see a Republican . '' 
Her Jewish mother and her Irish Catholic father contributed to her embrace of alternative politics , but it was a radical , bohemian aunt - a woman who used to fight against logging companies - who proved especially inspirational . 
Solnit describes herself as a cultural historian , but she has never fitted into the straitjacket of academe . 
Instead , she has written books and lectured on a freelance basis about such subjects as the American landscape - how indigenous inhabitants were ousted from the land that became the Yosemite national park , how the US government a century later instigated nuclear tests in Nevada . 
She often writes lyrically about these issues , describing , for instance , these two landscapes as serving as `` our national Eden and Armageddon '' . 
Solnit 's most popular book so far is her history of walking . 
But it is hardly a straight history or travel volume ; rather , it examines how walking became a political act in a technological , suburbanised society and how pedestrians - Gandhi 's salt walk , Martin Luther King 's marches , French demos - changed the world in part by physically claiming the streets . 
She insists on the joy of taking to the streets and engaging in communal activism , especially now , when we are encouraged to become discrete , passive consumers . 
She has a chastening line in her new book in which she asks her readers to imagine the world as a theater . 
`` The acts of the powerful and the official occupy center stage . 
The traditional versions of history , the conventional sources of news encourage us to fix our gaze on that stage . '' 
The result , she says , is `` the too-common silence of those who settle for being audience and who pay the price of the drama '' . 
Solnit is in the UK to lend her support to protest at the looming G8 meeting at Gleneagles . 
But she contends that local responses to global problems are at least as important as such gestures . 
For instance , she points out that , even though the US has not ratified the Kyoto treaty , her city government enforces Kyoto-style emission standards . 
She advocates what she calls `` post-oppositional activism '' . 
But to some , in a globalised world , that is an inadequate response . 
I remind Solnit that during her talk the previous evening she had been taken to task for this . 
Go preach that white , western , patronising philosophy to the street-fighting Uzbeks or to Palestinians resisting the Israeli state . 
Such was the question 's tenor . 
`` I really agree with you , '' Solnit told her accuser , post-oppositionally . 
`` I am not opposed to that kind of politics in those places . 
I just think in the world I inhabit , that stuff does n't work any more . ''

2005-06-01,"Reporters Bob Woodward -LRB- r -RRB- and Carl Bernstein in the Washington Post newsroom in 1973 . 
Photograph : AP The unmasking of Deep Throat serves as a potent reminder of a high point in American journalism . 
Through their doggedness , courage and skill , Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward , the two young Washington Post reporters , played a crucial role in bringing down Richard Nixon . 
Today , the two were careful to point out that there much more to the Watergate scandal than the revelations of Deep Throat . 
There were other sources , other investigators , dramatic senate hearings , those secret White House tape recordings - complete with an 18-minute silence - and the decisive intervention of a unanimous US supreme court . 
Yet none of that detracts from the achievement of the two reporters , who had the guts to confront a government that held itself above the law . 
Nixon and his cronies were engaged during this period in what the House judiciary committee later described as a series of criminal acts - obstruction of justice , withholding of material evidence , coercion of witnesses , and misuse of the CIA and the Internal Revenue Service . 
Watergate and the New York Times scoop on the Pentagon papers the year before represented the twin peaks of US journalism . 
But as anyone who has worked in the US can tell you , the Washington press corps is much more deferential these days , much more so than British journalists when confronting their politicians . 
Moreover the image of the US media has been badly tarnished recently . 
The New York Times was rocked by the Jayson Blair scandal , when a young reporter was caught fabricating stories . 
Newsweek recently had to retract its story about the Qu ` ran being flushed down the toilet . 
Just as serious was the easy ride the Bush administration received from the mainstream media in the run-up to the Iraq war . 
The New York Times famously bought into the line peddled by Ahmad Chalabi , the Iraqi exile , that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction . 
Subsequently there has been mistreatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib , the transfer of suspected terrorists without any meaningful legal review to interrogation centres in south-east Asia and elsewhere , as detailed by the indefatigable Seymour Hersh . 
But apart from Hersh it is difficult to think of anyone else digging hard into the seamy side of the administration 's war on terror . 
Despite all the military investigations into prisoner abuse , Hersh says quite rightly : `` The question that never gets adequately answered is this : what did the president do after being told about Abu Ghraib ? '' 
The failure to challenge the administration before and after the Iraq war does not reflect well on the mainstream US media , which badly needs a few more Seymour Hershes to keep the spirit of Watergate reporting alive .

2005-06-03,"Friday 3 June 2005 00.06 BST Faced with daily reports of car bombs and kidnappings , it 's difficult to feel optimistic about Iraq . 
But last week in the south of the country I heard a very different story . 
A story of the movement that has formed to rebuild the country 's economy and national pride , to create an Iraq with neither the tyranny of Saddam nor the pillage of military occupation . 
Last week Basra saw its first conference on the threat of privatisation , bringing together oil workers , academics and international civil-society groups . 
The event debated an issue about which Iraqis are passionate : the ownership and control of Iraq 's oil reserves . 
The conference was organised by the General Union of Oil Employees -LRB- GUOE -RRB- , which was established in June 2004 and now has 23,000 members . 
Focused as much on the broader Iraqi public interest as on members ' concerns , its first aim was to organise workers to repair oil facilities and bring them back into production during the chaos of the early months of occupation . 
This effort by the workers required both courage - often in conflict either with coalition troops or remnants of the Ba'athist regime - and considerable ingenuity , putting back together a working oil industry with minimal resources . 
In maintenance too , the Iraqi workers have outmatched their private-company counterparts . 
Walking round the Basra refinery , I pointed to the creaking and rusty equipment and asked the manager whether there were a lot of accidents , arising from failures of equipment under high pressure . 
The refinery manager said that accidents were rare , because however old the equipment it is constantly checked . 
`` For an Iraqi refinery operator , the refinery is part of him , '' he said . 
Contrast this with the disastrous safety record of British and American refineries . 
There , the frequent accidents are caused largely by lack of maintenance and inspection - which are in turn caused by the drastic downsizing of the workforce . 
The occupation forces and their allies in the Iraqi government see things differently . 
Plans are now afoot for sweeping changes to Iraq 's oil sector , to give western oil majors access to its reserves for the first time since 1972 . 
But they will face a challenge . 
While the workforce has shown itself to be quite capable of running the industry , it has been equally effective at shutting down that industry when threatened by the authorities . 
In August 2003 oil workers ' unions organised a strike that stopped all production in southern Iraq for two days . 
The resulting bargaining power has been impressive , with the unions - which later merged to become the GUOE - successfully pushing for foreign workers to be replaced by Iraqis ; the role of US companies in the reconstruction to be reduced ; and wages to be raised to liveable levels . 
And the GUOE is uncompromising in its views on oil privatisation . 
As one oil worker told me , he and his colleagues have rebuilt their industry after its destruction in three wars , and in the face of extreme adversity . 
As a result they have a deep sense of ownership , which they will not willingly relinquish .

2005-06-04,"Saturday 4 June 2005 10.32 BST Two Iraqi women walk through the old part of Basra , southern Iraq . 
Photograph : Samir Mizban\/AP It was once called the Venice of the East and with imagination you can still see why : boats skim across lagoons , golden domes glint in sunshine , coffee shops bustle in the old quarter . 
Stroll down the corniche at sunset and you can stop for kebab and ice cream , smoke a hubbly bubbly , play chess and listen to the water lapping below . 
And then , if you are a westerner , you can check you have not been followed , adjust your disguise , and signal to your bodyguard that you want to return to the hotel . 
Basra declared itself open to foreign visitors this week but instructed them to be vigilant , dress like locals and hire armed escorts . 
`` Then there is a 70 % to 80 % chance you will be OK , '' beamed Abdul Razuqi , the head of the tourism office in Iraq 's second city . 
Those odds are set to be tested if Iraqi Airways succeeds in running regular commercial flights between Basra and Heathrow , the first direct civilian air link between Iraq and the west . 
`` Flights to London should start soon . 
In the near future you will see many tourism initiatives here , '' Mohammad Musabah , the provincial governor , told the Guardian . 
Commercial flights between Basra and Baghdad resumed this week for the first time since the March 2003 invasion and there are plans to seek a slot at Heathrow within two months , according to Adel al-Helu , the head of the national airline 's Basra office . 
Repairs are due to start later this month on the gutted shell that was the Sheraton , the city 's only five-star hotel , and boatmen say they are ready to whisk paying clients around the Shatt al-Arab waterway . 
Its economy moribund , the city is desperate for investment and hopes to capitalize on its reputation as one of Iraq 's safer destinations . 
Adventure holidays are about adrenaline but the threat of kidnapping and assassination made Costa Basra more chilling than thrilling , said Don Lucey , whose Swindon-based firm , Bann Tours , aborted a trip to southern Iraq last July . 
`` It was too volatile so we stayed in Kuwait , '' he said . 
`` Anyone who goes alone into Iraq now is walking into a deathtrap . '' 
Mr Lucey hoped to lead another group into the country when security improved . 
Mr Razuqi , his office dark and hot in the wake of another power cut , suggested visitors could dye their hair and wear traditional robes to look more Iraqi . 
Helmets and body armor would give the game away . 
An attempt to write a brochure was abandoned because libraries with background material were burned and looted two years ago . 
`` But we can guide people ourselves , '' the tourism manager said . 
Those who can not wait for the Heathrow link can reach Iraq by flying from Istanbul to Irbil , in the relatively peaceful north , or fly from Syria or Jordan to Baghdad , or drive or sail from Kuwait or the United Arab Emirates to Basra . 
The city 's lagoons are striking from the air but corkscrew descents - a stomach-churning defense against missiles - can spoil the experience . 
Though the airport doubles as a British military base the terminal is often eerily deserted , with all but essential personnel and visitors banned . 
Soldiers in armored Land Rovers trundle from the main gate , a maze of blast walls and razor wire , but tourists would have to arrange their own rides into town , a former playground for the Gulf region degraded by two decades of war and neglect . 
The four-star Shatt al-Arab hotel is occupied by British troops but there are a dozen lesser hotels with spare rooms . 
The Mirbad , known to some guests as the Morbid , is popular for the visibility of guards with assault rifles . 
On Thursday a Shia cleric , Ali Abdul-Hussein , became the latest victim of sporadic assassinations which are blamed on rival militias and crooked police officers . 
But compared with Baghdad the port city is tranquil , with military patrols and bombs a rarity . 
`` Just 1 % of all incidents Iraq-wide happen here , '' said Stuart Innes , the British consul general . 
`` Property prices are up and we are nearing a tipping point for investment . 
Basra is blazing a trail . '' 
He displayed a 1970 photo of a white-jacketed waiter serving drinks at a corniche casino , swans and yachts gliding in the background . 
`` It used to be like Monte Carlo . '' 
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office advises against all but essential travel to Basra . 
Tourists who ignore that will find museums gutted , theaters shut , streets reeking with rubbish and sewage and waterways littered with capsized vessels , including Saddam Hussein 's yacht . 
The compensations are dazzling mosques , historic towns such as Qurna nearby , and marshes said to be the site of the Garden of Eden . 
When not disguised , westerners tend to be greeted warmly , if curiously . 
`` Problem in the head ? 
Why are you here ? '' 
one waiter asked the Guardian . 
One westerner said he acted deaf and dumb and even pretended to use sign language when out in public with his translator and guide . 
`` If they are ready to face the danger then they should come , though my advice is to wait for security to improve , '' said Khalaf al-Easa , the head of the city 's Iraqi Islamic party , an Arab Sunni group hostile to the occupation . 
Since the invasion religiously conservative Shias have turned what had been an open , liberal society into something closer to Iran , with alcohol banned and women strongly encouraged to wear the veil . 
Only men can sunbathe . 
Black market beer and whisky can be bought from back-alley traders in a slum nicknamed Chechnya for its banditry . 
But Mr Musabah , the governor , opened the door to an alcohol dispensation for tourists . 
`` In their hotels , maybe , '' he said . 
"
2005-06-05,"A second British soldier could face charges over the death of an Iraqi civilian as senior army commanders brace themselves for damaging new revelations about army behavior in Iraq . 
A formal military hearing on Friday will consider evidence against Lance Corporal Barry Singleton , 23 , following an investigation into claims that he fired his gun 12 times at a driver who tried to speed through a checkpoint . 
A decision on whether to press charges , which could include murder , against Singleton could coincide with an announcement to Parliament by the government 's most senior lawyer , Lord Goldsmith , that as many as 11 soldiers will be charged in connection with the death of another Iraqi civilian . 
Goldsmith 's statement could include charges levelled against a British commanding officer over the death of a 26-year-old Iraqi civilian , a move that would prove highly embarrassing to the Army . 
Lieutenant Colonel Jorge Mendonca , 41 , CO of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , is among the servicemen investigated over the death of Baha Mousa , a hotel receptionist in Basra . 
Singleton was on duty in Basra with the King 's Own Scottish Borderers in August 2003 when the shooting at the checkpoint occurred three months before the regiment 's tour of duty ended . 
This week 's preliminary hearing of military lawyers will evaluate the strength of the evidence surrounding the case and what , if any , charges will be brought against Singleton . 
It is understood that even if he does not face a murder charge , manslaughter may be an option . 
The news comes as human rights lawyers prepare to apply for a judicial review of events surrounding Camp Breadbasket , the humanitarian food depot near Basra and from where pictures of British troops abusing Iraqis were published during a court martial earlier this year . 
The legal challenge was discussed last week between Phil Shiner , of the Public Interest Lawyers practice , and human rights lawyer Ben Emmerson QC , who represented Katherine Gun , the former GCHQ translator accused of leaking details of an American ` dirty tricks ' operation to spy on the United Nations . 
Shiner wants his allegations that British troops were involved in ` systematic torture ' to be investigated . 
He has already secured a first judicial review into whether an independent inquiry should be held into the death of Mousa , who died in custody in September 2003 . 
The High Court heard that British soldiers used hooded Iraqi civilians as kickboxing targets , forced them to dance ` like Michael Jackson ' and beat one detainee for three days until he died . 
Charges so far brought against British troops include seven paratroopers charged with the murder of an Iraqi civilian ; their trial is scheduled for September . 
Lawyers for the men have claimed that the prosecution ` is full of holes ' and that the soldiers are victims of a ` culture of prosecution and political correctness ' . 
Army officers have so far investigated 167 allegations of abuse in Iraq . 
Saddam Hussein 's morale has collapsed as he has realized the gravity of the charges against him , the head of Iraq 's special tribunal said yesterday . 
The former dictator 's defiance at a court hearing last year has turned to despondency over accusations of mass murder and war crimes , said Raid Juhi , the judge who will try him . 
` He understands the extent of the charges and that he will stand trial before an impartial court , ' he told the London-based Asharq al-Awsat newspaper .

2005-06-08,"Wednesday 8 June 2005 00.39 BST There are many examples of Mexican politicians switching allegiances with each new season , but few have done so with as much energy and aplomb as Adolfo Aguilar Zinser , who has died in a car crash , aged 55 . 
Even fewer can expect to end their life as he did , with a reputation for integrity . 
Internationally , he caught the world 's attention in March 2003 , before the Iraq war , as Mexico 's UN ambassador at a time when his country held a seat on the security council . 
A flamboyant figure , with unruly gray hair , rimless glasses and a penchant for designer ties , he appeared to coolly defend Mexico 's anti-interventionist traditions , despite the ambiguous messages of his government . 
Together with the Chilean ambassador , Juan Gabriel Valds , Aguilar Zinser played a pivotal role in ensuring that other smaller , non-permanent council members also stood their ground . 
For many Mexicans , his willingness to incur the displeasure of the Bush administration was something they could feel proud of . 
It was a moment that sealed his reputation for political independence and daring . 
Not that Aguilar Zinser was ever a wallflower , and his career was littered with dramatic political gambles that often ended in personalised fallouts with former allies . 
It is a testament to his ability to find new ways of staying in the game that his death prompted tributes from across the political spectrum , and that his wake drew people he had not spoken to for years . 
Born into an established Mexico City family , Aguilar Zinser graduated from the prestigious Colegio de Mexico before taking a master 's degree in public administration at Harvard . 
While he remained linked to academia , he never kept away from the political action for long . 
Young , ambitious and reputedly brilliant , he began his public career when Mexico was ruled by the Institutional Revolutionary party -LRB- PRI -RRB- , the one-party regime established in 1929 that dominated the country until 2000 . 
In the mid-1970s , President Luis Echeverria made him head of a think-tank designed to make Mexico a standard bearer for the non-aligned world . 
At the time , the PRI enjoyed the approval of some Latin American leftists for its policy of welcoming exiles from the continent 's military dictatorships , even while it repressed its own dissidents at home . 
Over the years , however , Aguilar Zinser shifted towards the pro-democracy movement and joined Cuauhtemoc Cardenas , who , many believe , was denied electoral victory in 1988 by massive fraud . 
The association ended after Aguilar Zinser published a critical account of Cardenas 's next unsuccessful presidential campaign , in 1994 . 
Having established himself as a pro-democracy leader in his own right , Aguilar Zinser also gained a reputation as a committed environmental campaigner , briefly flirting with the Ecological party . 
In the late 1990s , another change of tactics turned him into a key figure in the successful presidential campaign of the brash , pro-business rancher Vicente Fox , of the National Action party -LRB- PAN -RRB- . 
Together with his equally cosmopolitan and erudite friend Jorge Castaeda , Aguilar Zinser persuaded many on the left to support the centre-right Fox in the 2000 election , as the only candidate who could bring down the PRI regime . 
Aguilar Zinser later fell out with both Castaeda , who tried to block his UN appointment , and Fox , who pushed him to resign from the post in November 2003 . 
Out in the political hinterland , Aguilar Zinser spent the rest of his life as a pundit . 
Most observers assumed he would return to the center stage soon , though few ventured to guess with which party his allegiances would be . 
He is survived by his wife , Martha , and two children , Adolfo and Nicols .

2005-06-09,"Stuff Happens ... in LA David Hare 's play about Blair , Bush and the Iraq invasion received its US premiere this week . 
How did it go down ? 
By Rob Kendt Thursday 9 June 2005 11.08 BST Big questions ... Nicholas Farrell as Blair and Alex Jennings as Bush in Stuff Happens . 
Photograph : Tristram Kenton There has to be a name for this noise : something between a jeer and a snicker , a gasp and a murmur . 
More telling than outright applause or laughter , it is unmistakeably the sound of an audience absorbing a play , rather than simply reacting to it . 
We heard a lot of that curious noise at the American premiere of Stuff Happens this week at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles . 
David Hare 's dramatised account of the run-up to the invasion of Iraq also drew its share of hisses , spontaneous ovations , relieved laughter and intent silence . 
In Hare 's play , the caricatures of the players we think we know all too well - George Bush , Tony Blair , Colin Powell and the rest - talk back , often stirringly , against our first impressions . 
When a dyspeptic Dick Cheney -LRB- Dakin Matthews -RRB- excoriates the world-changing idealism of Blair -LRB- Julian Sands -RRB- , positing instead American security as his sole concern , we 're momentarily hushed into weighing which justification for war is more troubling . 
When a pair of mincing French diplomats visit Condeleezza Rice -LRB- Lorraine Toussaint -RRB- to announce that they 're scrapping diplomatic efforts to save Gallic face , we ca n't help but share Rice 's shock at their naked self-interest . 
To the play 's mass of mostly familiar documentary material , Hare brings an imposing dramatic architecture . 
He frontloads the play with pro-war voices and rationales , and captures the momentum of inevitability that pervaded those terrible months in late 2002 and early 2003 . 
At the same time he sets up this house of cards for a hubristic fall in a devastating second act . 
After a rapid-fire conclusion that has the Bushies running away unapologetically from their stated casus belli , weapons of mass destruction , Hare closes with an Iraqi exile -LRB- Jay Harik -RRB- , as appalled by the invasion as by Saddam 's reign of terror , stating : `` A country 's leader is its own fault . '' 
Taking Hare 's play directly from its National Theatre debut last autumn is something of a coup for Mark Taper Forum artistic director Gordon Davidson , who 's leaving the post after this season , and for whom Hare 's play makes a fitting farewell . 
Davidson has led the Taper for nearly four decades with a commitment to politically engaged work , from the Vietnam protest play The Trial of the Catonsville Nine -LRB- which famously had FBI agents sniffing around the theater -RRB- to Zoot Suit and Twilight , Los Angeles 1992 . 
Davidson 's production of Stuff Happens is taut and involving , taking full advantage of the Taper 's intimate in-the-round stage to bring the actors out front , and subtly implicating us in scenes set in Congress , the UN , and various press briefing rooms . 
American critics have been mostly enthusiastic of Hare 's play , though many have questioned its neutrality . 
`` Leave it to the vocal peanut gallery -LRB- an Americanism meaning ill-informed people in the cheap seats -RRB- to deliver the obligatory standing ovation , the hisses and the cheers that Stuff Happens - a by no means neutral play - proclaims not to be courting but probably is , '' wrote Evan Henerson in the LA Daily News . 
`` Stuff Happens is not a diatribe , exactly , '' continued Henerson , `` but it 's hardly an unbiased docudrama , either . '' 
In the Hollywood Reporter , Jay Reiner compared Hare 's strategy with the warmongering tactics he portrays , writing that : `` The playwright had his mind made up well in advance about these people and their motives - and then did his best to disguise this with a thin veneer of objectivity and ideological evenhandedness ... In this sense , the play is much like the political drama it pretends to explore . '' 
Variety 's Joel Hirschhorn admired the play as a `` deeply felt , rigorously researched reminder of governmental manipulation and ineptitude '' , though he found the `` repetitive '' second half began to `` feel like a series of bulletins issued at board meetings '' . 
Writing for the Los Angeles Times , James C Taylor , the only one of our ranks who saw the production at the National in London , was able to report that Keith Carradine 's performance as Bush is `` finely tuned ... certainly more convincing than his London predecessor -LRB- Alex Jennings -RRB- ... and perhaps even more convincing than the genuine article . 
`` Many will no doubt come to the Mark Taper Forum play expecting to see Bush-bashing on a grand scale , '' wrote Taylor . 
`` But thankfully , Hare 's characterisation of the 43rd president of the United States is unique among current portraits , fictional or otherwise . 
The playwright chooses not to demonise or lionise him . 
Rather , Hare shrewdly depicts George W Bush as a man whose power derives simply from the stubbornness of his convictions -LRB- regardless of their origins -RRB- and the lack of similar fortitude on the part of those who oppose him . '' 
Registering the only strong dissent was the LA Weekly 's Steven Mikulan , who labeled it `` less a play than a timeline '' and found that `` after three hours you do n't know which to despair about more - the imperial direction of our foreign policy or Hare 's declining powers as a scenarist '' . 
Our exposure to Hare 's work , in LA at least , has been glancing : Davidson 's Center Theatre Group brought us Racing Demon and Skylight , and a small local company called Theatre 40 offered a bracing reading of The Secret Rapture years ago . 
Stuff Happens is something altogether different , the first significant dramatic narrative about the Iraq war in any medium , deposited on the very doorstep of the fabulists of Hollywood . 
It is shaming to report , in fact , that no American playwright , let alone filmmaker , has yet attempted anything close to its scope or acuity . 
We have seen Tim Robbins 's brittle agitprop revue , Embedded , whose main achievement was to prove that Robbins should stick to acting and offstage activism . 
And of course there was Fahrenheit 9\/11 , a sui generis blast of American bluster that no one could accuse of undue circumspection . 
Perhaps it takes a dramatist from the erstwhile empire that gave the world Shakespeare and Shaw to remind us of the uniquely immediate voice that theater can raise in the discourse about central questions of the age - not least because it invites us to add our own buzzing soundtrack of real-time reactions to the mix . 
Stuff Happens is at the Mark Taper Forum , Los Angeles , until July 17 .

2005-06-10,"Friday 10 June 2005 00.05 BST American diplomats and army commanders have held indirect talks with insurgents in Iraq , the first officially sanctioned contact between the two sides in two years of violence . 
A US embassy official in Baghdad said efforts were under way to `` engage '' elements of the resistance in an apparent softening of the Bush administration 's opposition to negotiations . 
`` In order to achieve stability and -LRB- an -RRB- end to the insurgency and stop Iraqis from being killed in large numbers , the insurgency has to be addressed , '' the official told reporters . 
`` I do n't think the people we are sitting in the room with are directly operational , but they have relationships with them , sometimes through family ties , sometimes through previous associations with the previous regime . '' 
The briefing was on the record but under embassy rules the official could not be named . 
He did not elaborate on the substance of the talks and it was unclear which of the insurgency 's numerous groups had been engaged . 
The contacts , conducted mainly through Sunni Arab tribal and religious leaders , were limited to factions which could be coaxed away from violence and into mainstream politics , the official added . 
That ruled out Abu Musab al-Zarqawi 's al-Qaida in Iraq and other radical Islamic groups believed responsible for most of the suicide bombings . 
`` Some insurgents are irredeemable and have to be dealt with in a purely military way . '' 
The US has made public overtures to Iraq 's Sunni Arabs , a disaffected minority driving the insurgency , but until now drew the line at contacts with the `` terrorists '' denounced by President Bush . 
The administration has come under increasing pressure to show progress in a war which claims approximately two American lives daily and is blamed for shortfalls in army recruitment . 
A recent Gallup poll showed 57 % of Americans do not believe it was worth invading in March 2003 . 
It is no secret that some US commanders on the ground have informal and indirect contacts with their opponents , mostly via Sunni mosques and tribal elders . 
The embassy official suggested those channels have become more formalised . 
The insurgency is a complex mix of criminal gangs , Sunni Arab nationalists , former members of Saddam Hussein 's Ba'ath regime and Islamic radicals , with many foreigners among the latter . 
Two years ago Mr Bush 's response was `` Bring 'em on '' . 
But as casualties soared and the nascent Iraqi state reeled , the US reached out to the Ba'athists and Sunnis , encouraging , for example , the country 's new Shia and Kurdish rulers to scale back purges known as `` de-Ba ` athification '' . 
Earlier this week an Arab Sunni politician and former electricity minister , Ayham al-Samarie , said two groups , the Islamic Army in Iraq and the Army of Mujahideen , were ready to talk to the government . 
The prime minister , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , said yesterday he hoped to draw `` all sectors '' of Iraqi society into the political process and hinted that this included homegrown insurgents . 
The ruling Shia and Kurdish coalition promised to give Sunni Arabs a greater role in writing a new constitution by increasing their membership on the drafting committee , where they occupy two out of 55 seats . 
Some officials said Sunnis would be given an additional 13 seats , matching Kurdish representation , but President Jalal Talabani , himself a Kurd , said the government would meet Sunni demands for an extra 20 to 25 seats . 
The British foreign secretary , Jack Straw , visiting Baghdad as part of a European Union delegation , expressed confidence that Iraq would have a referendum-approved constitution and elections by the end of the year . 
The delegation also pledged financial support for Iraq .

2005-06-12,"Colin Smith offers a magisterial account of the British retreat along the Malay peninsula in Singapore Burning , says Neal Ascherson The Australians at Singapore broke and ran . 
Anyone old enough to remember hearing that story must have wondered if it was n't just another of those sour wartime myths , brewed in British hearts to compensate for losing an empire and getting bread rationing . 
This tremendous book shows that it was . 
General Gordon Bennett 's infantry gave way and fled by the thousand as the Japanese stormed ashore . 
But seen across 60 years and by the standards of today , running away made sense . 
War is a mad island , on which reasonable behavior is reversed . 
People ` put themselves in harm 's way ' , as opponents of the Iraq war touchingly put it , instead of moving out of danger . 
They are required to disconnect instinct and stay in position as a mortar barrage approaches . 
They must try to kill other people who , if left unchallenged , might not try to kill them back . 
Three states of mind can help soldiers achieve this reversal . 
One is blind obedience , becoming an institutionalised patient in the madhouse . 
The second is believing that the safety of the family or community you love is genuinely at stake . 
The third is to have an at least credible expectation of winning this war . 
The Australians at Singapore had none of these . 
As free men , they found it hard to risk their necks on the orders of officers they considered dangerous idiots . 
As citizens , they would have been happy to biff Jerries in defense of poor old England , but what were they doing defending the privileges of stuck-up Poms in this Asian colony ? 
As soon as they got into action on the Malay peninsula , it became obvious the Japanese were going to win . 
Churchill sent telegrams about fighting to the bitter end and dying in the ruins of Singapore to save the honor of the race . 
Thousands of Australians , who were to fight fiercely and expertly in later campaigns , did n't see the point of that and headed for the docks . 
Reading Smith 's account , you see their logic . 
How could the British and Australians have hoped to win with the resources they had ? 
The Japanese assault force was numerically smaller than the defense , but mostly composed of highly trained and battle-hardened troops . 
Malaya was defended by a strange assortment of British regulars , inexperienced Australians and Indian army divisions whose men were often half-trained teenagers . 
The Japanese brought tanks and a large tactical airforce . 
The British had no tanks and , worse , very few anti-tank weapons . 
Their airforce , mainly composed of slow and obsolete machines without modern fighters until the last few days , lost half its strength in the first 24 hours after the Japanese landed in northern Malaya on 8 December 1941 . 
When bombs and torpedoes sank the battlecruiser Repulse and the battleship Prince of Wales two days later , Japan achieved naval as well as air supremacy . 
It 's true that the defenders were plagued by terrible mistakes and bad luck . 
These nourish fantasies that the outcome could have been different . 
If the British had entered southern Thailand , instead of dithering until it was too late , could n't they have slaughtered the invaders on the beaches ? 
If Admiral Phillips had set off earlier to attack the invasion fleet , or turned back as soon as he knew his warships had been spotted , could n't the Japanese troopships have been scattered ? 
If the ship with more anti-tank guns had n't been sunk ; if the RAF had possessed Hurricanes at the start instead of the old Brewster Buffalos ; if the Australian artillery had received the signals that the Japanese assault landing on Singapore island had begun ... But none of these possibilities was the case . 
Even if they had been , Smith 's book suggests that the attack would have still prevailed . 
The defenders , often heroically brave , were simply not up to it . 
Symptomatic is their shocking failure to communicate . 
The radios did not work , the field-telephone cables broke , the signals routines were chaotic . 
When the first landings began at Kota Baharu , all communications with Singapore jammed so that it was 90 minutes before local aircraft were ordered to bomb the beaches . 
It was also true that the Japanese were better soldiers . 
Smith points out that they were neither suicidal fanatics nor trained jungle fighters . 
Their personal weapons were slightly inferior . 
` What -LRB- they -RRB- had in abundance was courage , endurance and a discipline that , in their eagerness to see that orders were carried out , did not stifle initiative but encouraged it . ' 
Most of this book is an account , from hundreds of sources on both sides , of the long British retreat down the Malay peninsula , punctuated by desperate battles . 
Colin Smith knows how it feels to be a soldier , and his story - the experiences of named men and units as they fought , retreated with terrible wounds or died - is unforgettably well told . 
So is his history of the aftermath : the fall of the great city , the bayoneting of the hospital wounded , the murder of the Australian nurses , the massacre of the Chinese population . 
The British commander , General Percival , lost 7,500 dead in the 10-week campaign . 
Then he went with his men into captivity , where more than 12,000 died . 
General Gordon Bennett bolted and got a boat to Sumatra . 
History should be rougher with him than with his soldiers . 
They asked themselves what they were dying for and found no convincing answer .

2005-06-12,"Spielberg 's The War of the Worlds is the latest version of HG Wells 's 1898 novel . 
Peter Conrad traces our fascination with invaders from outer space Young , sappy cultures devise myths about creation . 
Cosmos , according to the ancient fables of the Greeks , emerged from the uterine gulf of chaos . 
Or perhaps the God of Genesis personally ordained and organised our world , complimenting Himself on its goodness and stocking it with species which were commanded to increase and multiply . 
In the lore of the Australian aborigines , the earth is dreamed into existence by spirit-ancestors who walk across the land and sculpt it . 
We are too far from those fresh origins to take such - stories seriously : our urgent concern is to understand how the world will end , not to imagine its beginning . 
Cast : Dakota Fanning , Justin Chatwin , Miranda Otto , Tim Robbins , Tom Cruise As ever , Steven Spielberg understands the communal mood . 
Having imagined aliens as benign cerebral angels in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and ET , he has now chosen to film a more fatally grisly account of the collision between cultures or species in War of the Worlds . ' 
9\/11 , ' as Spielberg has remarked , ` changed everything . ' 
On the posters for his film , a rotating globe pauses to display the US , extended between its shining seas . 
But nothing shines : red prehensile suckers that belong to some unseen , unclassifiable life-form grip Texas , while the Midwest is a scorching maelstrom . 
As befits a summer blockbuster , the film piles up catastrophes , and its promised highlights include a crashing plane , a capsizing ferry , and the usual mobs of traumatised extras . 
The last hope of mankind appears to be Tom Cruise in a leather jacket and tactically ripped jeans . 
In 1898 , society prepared to confront a fin-de-sicle that seemed likely , as a witty nihilist puts it in a play by Oscar Wilde , to be the fin du monde . 
Man had recently killed off God ; having destroyed its creator , could our species expect to survive much longer ? 
Anticipating that terminus , HG Wells wrote an apocalyptic romance about it , The War of the Worlds . 
We have been retelling his story ever since . 
In Wells 's novel Martians on skeletal tripods descend to trample or gobble up earthlings who seem , to their superior intellects , mere noxious insects . 
Our frail blue planet is overrun by mechanised conquerors from a world which is red , bellicose , unmerciful . 
Wells considered this outcome to be just and logical . 
European empires , enslaving or exterminating new worlds elsewhere on our globe , had been equally remorseless . 
His novel reminded Europeans that their tenure of power was insecure , and - quite apart from its critique of imperialism - pointed out that we live on an ailing planet in a moribund universe , doomed by the cooling of the sun . 
Wells had no doubt about where the end of the world should take place . 
When he wrote , Britain was the global overlord . 
His Martians therefore bump to earth in the Home Counties . 
They advance into London and demolish it to clear a nursery for the red weed that sustains them , before expiring - brought low by measly bacteria , not by human force or divine intervention - in rancid heaps in Regent 's Park . 
The book ends with the narrator looking down from Primrose Hill , delighted to see the chimneys of the reconstructed capital smoking again . 
His contentment seems absurdly complacent now , and also sadly provincial . 
The course of empire soon moved westward , so when Orson Welles performed a radio adaptation of Wells 's story in October 1938 , he inevitably altered the setting . 
Now the Martian rocket cylinder lands in New Jersey , and its stilted warriors stalk across the countryside towards New York . 
They wade over the Hudson River , dwarfing the Manhattan skyline as they rise like a series of new , spiked towers ; they stride down the avenues of the current imperial capital , and terrorised multitudes hurl themselves into the East River ` like rats ' . 
Welles 's transmission breaks off as a reporter drops his microphone and collapses , asphyxiated by lethal fumes . 
` This is the end now , ' he gasps . 
Welles immediately explained that the broadcast had been a Halloween prank , with the Martians as those ridiculous revenants who are supposed to quit their graves on All Souls ' Night . 
But by then , the damage was done ; listeners unaware of the practical joke had panicked , and by spreading the news provoked a communal nervous breakdown . 
Welles exposed the psychological vulnerability of his society , which was ready to believe in the certainty of its own extinction . 
Welles was made to feel like Judas , as he said next morning . 
Every time The War of the Worlds is retold , God - the upholder of human supremacy , for we are supposed to be his pet species - is put to death again . 
The myth made itself at home in 1938 , and demonstrated its credentials as a prophetic fiction . 
Howard Koch 's script found a contemporary relevance in the artilleryman Wells 's hero meets on Putney Hill . 
Newly encountered near the Holland Tunnel leading into Manhattan , he becomes a gloating fascist who rejoices in the assault on the city and on liberal illusions about progress and democracy ; barbarism , he predicts , will reinvigorate the world . 
By 1952 , when Byron Haskin directed a film version , the war of the worlds seemed already to have happened . 
The prophecy had fulfilled itself , so the film used newsreels of European cities flattened by bombs during the Second World War to document the Martian advance . 
As if in retreat from the old , bankrupt , ruined continent , the action was moved further westwards . 
The Martian craft now land in California , and the city they topple is Los Angeles . 
Early in the Cold War , the story turned into a trial of competing technical and military might . 
HG Wells 's Martians cannibalise humans , but in 1952 they rely on radiating weapons that reduce men to gray piles of ash . 
A scientist in the Haskin film suggests that they belong to a superior culture . 
That , for the Pentagon generals who manage reprisals , is reason enough to destroy them , and an atomic bomb is lobbed at their mother ship ; they repel it by raising an electronic umbrella . 
The conflict turns into a holy war against what Reagan - whose geopolitical world-view was formed by such vacuous Hollywood products - would surely have called an ` evil empire ' . 
The menaced citizens of Los Angeles hole up in their churches , and fervently pray for deliverance ; the comeuppance of the Martians is a consequence of atheistic hubris , when one of them smashes a stained glass window and instantly lunges out of the sky . 
It 's still microbes that vanquish them , but the film 's narrator , piously altering Wells 's bleaker text , assumes that God created those germs for exactly this purpose . 
The deity remains a loyal American . 
It 's apt that Tom Cruise - aware that he had signed up for a crusade - insisted on installing a Scientology tent on Spielberg 's set , so he could proselytise for his cult between takes . 
Wells 's story satirised the lazy rapacity of men by exposing them to a race of even more implacable predators . 
In successive retellings , it grew blunter and began to pander to the very complacency it first condemned . 
Jeff Wayne 's rock opera The War of the Worlds - recorded in 1978 with Richard Burton narrating and David Essex among the singers - cosily redeems the Hitlerian artilleryman who fantasises about revenge in the Welles broadcast . 
Now , as he huddles in the sewers , he sings a rousing anthem about the ` brave new world ' men will build below ground , with railway tunnels to the coast so they can have holidays at the beach . 
Poverty , he casually promises , will be abolished . 
Not even the Martians can resist the optimism of music . 
Wayne 's adaptation did have a serious point , and a computer game developed from it interprets The War of the Worlds as an allegory about the fight to sequester our planet 's diminishing resources . 
If you play on the home team , you battle to conserve supplies of steel , coal and oil ; the Martians want copper and human blood , their favorite tipple . 
Still , to reduce this eschatological war to a game implies a jaunty incomprehension of its meaning . 
Interestingly , Haskin 's 1952 film mocked such frivolous profiteering : the hicks in whose town the Martians land plan to open their own amusement park , with enchiladas for sale at the site . 
` We 've got a goldmine in our backyard , ' they gloat just before they are atomised . 
During the 1980s Spielberg planned to transform The War of the Worlds into a roller-coaster ride for the Universal Studios theme parks in Los Angeles and Orlando . 
At that stage he too thought of it as a ludic fantasy ; now , after 9\/11 , he sees it as a baleful premonition of the end . 
In 1996 Tim Burton 's Mars Attacks ! 
The film was based on a set of bubble-gum cards in which Martians with heads full of green guano make miscegenated love to nubile female earthlings . 
Its farcical mayhem strays far from the story told by Wells , yet it is closer than any other adaptation to the pessimistic spirit of the original book , because it refuses to assume that the human race has any automatic right to prevail . 
Just who , in this film , are the monsters ? 
Not , surely , the extra-terrestrials ; I 'd sooner vote for Danny DeVito as a gambling midget , Rod Steiger as a demented general , Jack Nicholson as the vain , dumb , useless American President , or Tom Jones as himself . 
For once , the rampages of the invaders are not to be regretted . 
Annette Bening , as a blissed-out hippy , says that the human race does n't deserve to live , and Sylvia Sidney , playing a dotty tribal elder , whoops with hilarity at the latest atrocity : ` They blew up Congress ! 
When Sarah Jessica Parker , an air-brained chat-show hostess , says that the Martians look gross , the professorial Pierce Brosnan sucks on his pipe and reminds her that we probably look just as repellent to them . 
The invaders in his film are immune to the usual microbes , but have a fatal allergy to the country and western yodellings of Slim Whitman . 
If civilisation is saved by the ululations of a forgotten folk singer , is it worth saving at all ? 
For Spielberg 's screenwriter David Koepp , the story trips up that triumphal civilisation . 
His Martians , he claims , are merely conducting the belligerent foreign policy of the US , even though this time they happen to be stomping into New York . 
What stops the armored , insensitive global power is ' a local insurgency ' ; the film , he says , is his commentary on the Iraq war . 
We may at last be getting back to what Wells had in mind a century ago . 
The War of the Worlds is not about a combat with aliens : actually it dramatises the self-destructiveness of our own small , over-heated , apopleptic planet . 
We delude ourselves if we expect our world to have a happy ending .

2005-06-13,"The -LRB- relatively -RRB- moderate conservative cleric Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , an ally of the unelected supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , is widely tipped to prevail in the election . 
But Iranian bloggers are today writing that this may not be the certainty everyone had thought and that there is a late surge from the main reform candidate , former education minister Mostafa Moin , 54 . 
Hossein Derakhshan , a Toronto-based Iranian who is visiting Tehran , writes on his Editor : Myself blog that he can not believe `` that mainstream media in Iran are ignoring all signs of a reformist candidate 's rise and still pushing for Rafsanjani as the savior '' .

Ken Livingstone is 60 today . 
The mayor has no official engagements today , but the London Assembly Lib Dems lost no time in wishing him a happy birthday . 
`` Mr Livingstone is now entitled to his Freedom Pass that will allow him to travel across the capital free of charge , '' a spokesman said today . 
`` The Liberal Democrats are hoping that with his new bus pass , the mayor will take the opportunity to visit many of the outer London areas that he has neglected over the last five years . '' 
Actually , he wo n't be collecting the bus pass he 's entitled to - and anyway , a free travelcard is one of the perks of working at City Hall . 
The mayor has enjoyed remarkable popularity ratings among Londoners since he was elected in 2000 , and few would bet against his running for a third term in 2008 . 
But his detractors sense impending trouble . 
They say Livingstone has neglected the binge drinking and traffic problems of suburban areas like Sutton and Croydon in favor of big inner city projects , and has failed to do enough to improve the Underground or combat congestion . 
No doubt his critics will be out in force at the 2005 State of London debate next week .

Downing Street has announced the appointment of the 98th Archbishop of York , who will be John Sentamu , the first black man to hold the post in its 1,500 year history . 
It will be the most senior appointment ever held by a member of an ethnic minority within the Church of England . 
Sentamu , currently Bishop of Birmingham , immediately traveled to York today - taking the last second class place on a train full of York racegoers - to pray before the high altar of the great medieval cathedral , perhaps conscious that his journey has been rather longer and more extraordinary , probably , than that of any of his predecessors since the appointment of the city 's first archbishop , Paulinus , in 625 AD . 
Continue reading ... Andy Kershaw , the Radio 3 presenter and world music enthusiast , began the backlash against the largely white Live 8 line-ups when he said it would do nothing for `` Africa 's self-esteem '' . 
He returns to the topic in the Independent , accusing Bob Geldof of `` breathtaking arrogance '' for inviting African artists to play at an `` Africa Calling '' concert at the Eden Project in Cornwall . 
First , he dismisses the idea of having Africans on his bill since , supposedly , they are not big enough draws . 
Now , outrageously , he is planning to corral the Africans into Cornwall rather than allow them to appear on the same stage , on equal terms , with their European and American counterparts . 
And I thought apartheid was dead ... Kershaw 's language is strong and , as this blog has argued before , the extension others have made of his argument - that Live 8 is somehow a conspiracy to keep Africans down - is missing the point . 
The idea is to create a populist upsurge to pressure the G8 leaders , not to change the public 's attitude to Africa . 
That would be a happy consequence , however , and if - as Kershaw puts it - a `` few African bands -LRB- may even be -RRB- refreshing after watching hours of clapped-out , over-familiar rock stars '' , that is no bad thing either . 
I 've just spoken to religious affairs correspondent Stephen Bates , who 's on a train with the Church of England 's first black Archbishop . 
Stephen will be posting to the Newsblog today . 
European leaders are meeting today in Brussels to discuss the thorny question of budget reforms .

Where 's the best place to hit capitalism where it hurts ? 
On the course , of course . 
The links between golf and filthy lucre have always looked pretty strong , as this report in Capitalism magazine perfectly illustrates , hailing the climax of the 2003 US Masters as `` a good day for golf , capitalism , and , of course , Mike Weir '' . 
After all , what other sport attaches such importance -LRB- in public , at any rate -RRB- to its ` money list ' ? 
Indeed , one of the moments of maximum emotional impact in Michael Moore 's Fahrenheit 9\/11 , the evidence that appeared to clinch the case for George Bush 's status as corporate ratbag no 1 , came when the president turned to the cameras after outlining his stance on global terrorism and urged : `` Now watch this drive . '' 
So it seemed appropriate when this year 's summit of the G8 group of the world 's wealthiest nations was sited in Gleneagles , one of the world 's most famous golfing spots . 
But , those less favourably disposed to the idea of global capitalist hegemony have also dabbled in the sport , and Gleneagles 2005 provided a perfect opportunity for anti-capitalism protesters to make their point . 
An anarchist organization calling itself the People 's Golfing Association looks able to achieve this aim with some lan , even if their style is slightly more SAS commando than Payne Stewart . 
Theresa May wants more women . 
Specifically , she wants 50 of them to fight the Tories ' most winnable seats at the next election . 
This may not sound particularly radical - and by the standards of the Labor party , which has already embraced all-female shortlists and the Emily 's List initiative , it is n't . 
None the less , the shadow secretary 's call for half of the Tories ' top targets to be contested by women will dismay many in the party - and not just male would-be candidates , but also those who oppose positive action on principle . 
As many of them admitted at a Fawcett Society fringe event last year , Tory ladies of a certain age tend to pick men to represent them in the Commons . 
Often this is because they fear women with families will not be able to devote all their resources to winning the seat . 
Sometimes female candidates lack the time for the schmoozing that wins over local party members . 
And there is strong grassroots resistance to all-female shortlists - not just because members feel Conservative Central Office is telling them what to do , but because Tories tend to believe that the talented should be able to rise to the top without special favors .

This year the judges have upped the stakes with one of the strongest shortlists the prize has ever fielded . 
Of the six books to have made it to the final round , the ones to watch are Alexander Masters ' life-in-reverse of homeless man Stuart Shorter , Stuart : A Life Backwards , which received buckets of press coverage on its publication , Orhan Pamuk 's musical biography of his home city , Istanbul , and Jonathan Coe 's life of BS Johnson , Like a Fiery Elephant , which is generally held by everyone who has read it to be wonderful .

Sunday 's papers reported that Jackson is ` frantic ' to appear at the Philadelphia concert . 
Interviewed today on London 's radio station Capital FM , promoter Harvey Goldsmith confirmed that they would certainly ` consider ' adding Jackson to the bill , if approached by the singer . 
Goldsmith added : `` Whether it 's appropriate or not is another issue , whether he 's in a fit state to work is another issue , whether he can work is another issue and whether he can work live is another issue . '' 
Sean Penn visits Tehran 's cinema museum . 
Photograph : Hasan Sarbakhshian\/AP Actor\/activist Sean Penn is in Tehran to report on the Iranian election campaign for the San Francisco Chronicle , the blog Iran Scan reports . 
According to Reuters , Penn visited Friday prayers , scribbling away in his notebook . 
Iran Scan 's Afshin Molavi writes : I wonder how Sean Penn will see things . 
Will he honestly portray what he sees ? 
Or will he be blinded by his hatred of President George W Bush to fall into the trap many a good leftist falls into : defending the Islamic Republic to take a jab at Bush . 
Progressives in America consistently fail to side with the forces for democracy in Iran because it might just seem too , well , Wolfowitzian or , worse , Rumsfeldian . 
The Chronicle has yet to publish any of Penn 's reports , as far as I can see . 
But as Molavi points out , on the one hand , Penn 's presence ensures that more Americans will learn about Iran : on the other , it 's worth recalling the last Middle East country he visited was Iraq in December 2002 . 
And we all know how that ended up . 
Also in Tehran is Iranian blogfather Hossein Derakhshan , who is visiting his home country for the first time in several years . 
It 's a brave act for a blogger who knows all too well the risks of speaking out . 
It 's possible that Penn and Hoder , as Derakhshan is known , could meet via the networking powers of blogging powerhouse Joi Ito , if the comments on this post are anything to go by . 
Meanwhile events in Iran have taken a worrying turn . 
Sunday 's bombings have hardly improved the mood of the campaign - now being described as the closest in the country 's history - as it enters its final stages ahead of Friday 's vote . 
Blogger Mr Behi says : `` Street bombing is rare here in Iran and I can not personally recall one in many years '' , while S'can - Iranic calls the attacks `` ominous '' . 
Michael Jackson is innocent . 
We 've got audio from Dan Glaister , our reporter who covered the trial in Santa Maria , California ; we 'll be rounding up bloggers ' reactions , we 've a digest of what the UK 's papers say ; and we 're gathering photographs of fans celebrating outside the courthouse . 
As I write , Tony Blair is speaking in Paris ahead of talks with Jacques Chirac . 
Earlier in Luxembourg he rejected a proposal by the EU presidency to freeze Britain 's contentious budget rebate - Matthew Tempest reports here . 
In Iraq , there have been bombings in Kirkuk and Baghdad ; suspected Islamist terrorists have been arrested in Germany ; and there are warnings of a cholera outbreak in the Afghan capital , Kabul . 
Declan Walsh 's friends in Pakistan often berate him for failing to find positive news stories to write about . 
`` The problem in Pakistan is that there is just so much bad news , '' he writes . 
For example , in his world dispatch today he details the case of Mukhtaran Bibi , who became a national hero after confronting in court the gang that raped her but who has now been banned from leaving the country . 
Waiting for tonight 's Michael Jackson verdict gave us the chance to indulge in some serious TV news geekery . 
So let 's get the obvious , cliched response out of the way . 
This was the OJ chase all over again tonight , not quite 11 years since the last one , but looking much the same as before . 
All the channels cut to helicopter footage of Jackson 's four vehicle SUV convoy slowly being waved out of his Neverland ranch by a long line of staff , and then watched as it made its way along the freeways to the courthouse in Santa Maria . 
As those images filled our screens , each of the British news channels was living up to stereotypes in the background . 
So ITV News Channel did something cheap-looking , with lots of people on the phone and - it seems - none of their own people actually in California , relying instead on the US MSNBC network . 
The BBC managed to be rather more sober and , of course , big budget , with their correspondent going on matters like security and What Happens Next from Live Outside The Courthouse .

Kenya , for one , did not qualify for debt relief , while three of its neighbors and major trading partners did . 
That left the East Africa Standard wondering if the country would `` lose its competitive edge against Uganda and Tanzania , given their treatments under arrangements such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries -LRB- HIPC -RRB- initiative . 
Rwanda has been included in the HIPC initiative . '' 
Kenya 's frustrated assistant minister for trade , Petkay Miriti , told the paper that Kenya had met all conditions imposed by western capital over time and yet the goalposts kept changing . 
`` It will be difficult for us because our neighbors will be investing that money in services and mobilising trade when we are servicing debts . '' 
Nigeria - aka Africa 's richest debtor - would understandably like its $ 35bn debt written off as well . 
New World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz made Abuja his first stop on an inaugaral four-city tour of Africa , and Nigeria lost no time in making its case . 
The response sounded cautiously optimistic , with Nigeria 's daily Guardian quoting Wolfowitz as saying creditor nations would `` hopefully come up with a deal to forgive Nigeria 's debt '' .

OK , Peter , we 've pressed it . 
The EU 's trade commissioner is delivering a rare speech at the Fabian Society tonight and will argue that New Labor 's mix of social justice and economic reform is the only way forward for the EU . 
But he will warn his old boss that the essence of Blairism is not getting across in Brussels . 
`` In Brussels , Britain has sounded neo-Thatcherite as though nothing has changed from the 1980s , '' Mandelson will tell the Fabians . 
`` Both tone and substance need now to change if the British government is to command attention and win the backing it seeks on the continent . 
A greater effort must be made to get this right during the UK presidency . '' 
What does that mean for Britain 's EU rebate ? 
It means , he says , that Britain will eventually have to compromise . 
`` It is surely wrong to ask the poorer new accession states to pay for any part of the rebate . '' 
The UK risks `` playing into the hands '' of Jacques Chirac if it rules out reform altogether : `` Disengagement from Europe at this time would be a total betrayal of Britain 's national interest . 
... Britain would walk naked into the world of globalisation . '' 
Blairisme has its admirers in France . 
But the suggestion that New Labor has the answer to the EU 's problems - if Tony could only make the Europeans grasp it - is cheekily Mandelsonian .

News that Pink Floyd have managed to bury their 24-year-old feud and reunite for London 's Live 8 concert on July 2 will amaze fans of the Jurassic prog-rockers , though it merely fuels Damon Albarn 's argument that the show is crammed with white Anglo-Saxons , writes Adam Sweeting . 
The Floyd split was basically the band versus Roger Waters , the Wagner of pomp rock and the man who masterminded the conceptual nightmare that was The Wall . 
The solo Waters performed The Wall in Berlin in 1990 , but he has n't played with the Floyd since they toured the piece in 1981 . 
During the split , Waters allegedly printed up a roll of toilet paper with guitarist Dave Gilmour 's face on every sheet . 
`` It 's great to be asked to help Bob -LRB- Geldof -RRB- raise awareness of debt and poverty , '' said Waters , 61 .

2005-06-20,"He was a Foreign Office diplomat on the fast track to an ambassadorship and knighthood . 
So why , after 15 years at the top , did Carne Ross turn his back on the power and the status to go freelance ? 
Carne Ross : ` I 'd read the intelligence on WMD for four and a half years , and there 's no way that it could sustain the case that the government was presenting . ' 
Photograph : Sarah Lee Carne Ross must have been an unusual schoolboy . 
He did n't dream of being a footballer , a cricketer or even an engine driver . 
He dreamed of being a diplomat . 
`` At quite a young age , '' he recalls , `` I realized that I was fascinated by abroad . 
I decided quite early on that I was going to become a diplomat , and was very discouraged by everybody saying it was incredibly difficult and that only very clever people became diplomats . '' 
At 22 , fresh out of Exeter University , Ross proved the doubters wrong : he passed the necessary exams , joined the Foreign Office 's graduate fast-track , worked at the UK embassy in Bonn and its mission to the UN , enjoyed a good salary , status , even a sniff of power , and was on course to an ambassadorship with obligatory knighthood . 
Then , last September , the dream turned to dust . 
He quit - part of the diplomatic fallout from the Iraq war - to be an `` independent diplomat '' . 
A contradiction in terms , according to some of his Foreign Office friends , but not according to the Joseph Rowntree Charitable Trust , which last week chose Ross as one of its seven `` visionaries for a just and peaceful world '' . 
For the next five years , the trust will pay him a stipend of almost # 40,000 a year to attempt to prove his former colleagues wrong and turn his vision of what might be called committed diplomacy - putting right before might and morality before national interest - into reality . 
Ross , a confident , crop-haired 38-year-old , spent 15 years in the Foreign Office . 
He loved the life but ultimately hated having to bend the truth on behalf of his country . 
The gradual process of disillusionment began in Germany in the mid-1990s when refugees from the war in Yugoslavia flooded into the country . 
`` We of course supported the British policy that the war in Yugoslavia was a civil war and that an arms embargo was a fair way of treating all the parties , '' he says . 
`` This was deeply mistaken and inhuman . 
In effect it enabled one group to genocidally pursue another . 
The war was born of a grasp for power by Milosevic and his henchmen on the back of an invented Serb nationalism . '' 
It took Ross almost a decade to realize the full extent of the mistakes the Foreign Office made in the Balkans . 
His lack of faith in British policy in the Middle East manifested itself far more quickly . 
From 1995-98 he worked in London on the Middle East peace process and as speechwriter to foreign secretary Malcolm Rifkind , before joining the British delegation at the UN , where the issue of Iraq - he was the key British negotiator with the Iraqi government and the weapons inspectors - was soon to take over his life . 
He says the New York posting , which occupied him for almost five years , was `` dramatic '' , `` exciting '' , `` challenging '' . 
The hours were long but he enjoyed the drama - trying to work out what the Iraqis were doing , negotiating resolutions in the security council , being pursued by film crews desperate to understand where the diplomatic dance was leading . 
But , in Ross 's mind , one word obliterates all those others - `` guilt '' . 
`` I think sanctions -LRB- against Iraq -RRB- were wrong and they harmed the wrong people , '' he says . 
`` They did immeasurable damage to the Iraqi civilian population . 
We were conscious of that damage , but we did too little to address it . 
We said we were trying to address it , but frankly it was n't enough and I 'm not proud of my own role in that because I was a vigorous defender of British policy in the security council . 
We would not have treated a European or American people in that way . '' 
Ross was in New York on September 11 2001 and his recollection of the attack on the World Trade Centre is vivid . 
`` I saw the first plane go over and then went to a ludicrous EU meeting which dragged on as reports were coming in of the attacks , '' he recalls . 
`` The meeting ended after both planes struck . 
The UN building was evacuated and we were sent home . 
My home was downtown , so I walked back against this flood of people coming the other way - people covered in ashes and weeping . 
I went to my apartment on the south side of Union Square which looks south over lower Manhattan . 
I watched all afternoon , watched this huge pall of smoke which did n't go away for weeks . 
You could smell it in the apartment and in the streets around for weeks afterwards . '' 
The lesson he draws from 9\/11 is of the compassion of New Yorkers and the way political leaders in the US and UK misjudged the mood . 
`` There was no desire for vengeance among people on the streets , '' he says . 
`` Union Square became a collecting point for people to light candles , pray , sing , grieve . 
I 'd make my way through these crowds every day and it affected me very profoundly . 
Tragically , that compassion is something that the governments of both the US and Britain have seemed to ignore since . '' 
In the wake of 9\/11 , Ross was given responsibility for UK policy on Afghanistan . 
He quickly realized that meant preparing for war . 
When the invasion came , he spent six weeks in Kabul negotiating with warlords . 
Again his account tempers the excitement of the moment with the disillusionment of having to come to terms with what could be achieved . 
The allies did n't understand Afghanistan , did n't have sufficient forces on the ground , were trapped in their fortified compounds , were naive about the willingness of the warlords to cede power , and were far too optimistic in their belief that opium production could be curtailed . 
He returned to New York and , increasingly doubtful of the wisdom of British policy in the Middle East , decided to take a year-long sabbatical , joining the graduate international affairs program at the New School in Greenwich Village , where he studied a subject of which Donald Rumsfeld might approve - the limits of knowledge in decision-making . 
`` I was ultimately trying to grasp the claim in diplomacy , and in policy-making in general , to knowledge , '' explains Ross , `` because I had doubts about the whole thing . 
What is it that we know , how do we know it and how can we make policy on the basis of that knowledge ? 
Examining the theory helped crystallise a lot of my doubts . '' 
While he was on sabbatical , Britain and the US invaded Iraq and Ross 's doubts turned to anger . 
`` I was very close to my former colleagues in the mission and was in touch with a lot of the diplomats at the security council , '' he says . 
`` I was very conscious of what the British government was doing , and I was very sceptical of it . 
I contemplated resigning at the time and making a fuss , but felt that resigning would be standing up in front of a runaway train and I 'd just be crushed . 
`` It was an agonised experience because I knew that the evidence they were presenting for WMD was totally implausible . 
I 'd read the intelligence on WMD for four and a half years , and there 's no way that it could sustain the case that the government was presenting . 
All of my colleagues knew that , too . 
We all believed the Iraqis had something , but that is very different from saying they had that much . 
The intelligence indicated that they 'd failed to account for what they had in the past . 
They had n't given us a complete account of the disposal of their past stocks , so we thought there was something , but there was no way that the claim of an imminent threat was sustainable . 
The 45-minute stuff was ridiculous . '' 
He had lost faith in the Foreign Office but had no idea what to do with his life , so at the end of his sabbatical year he engineered a compromise - a secondment to the UN in Kosovo . 
In the summer of 2004 , he supplied a secret , written testimony to the Butler inquiry on intelligence and weapons of mass destruction . 
The act of giving evidence finally brought his career as a British diplomat to an end . 
`` I told -LRB- the inquiry -RRB- what I knew in terms of the evidence on WMD and what the inspectors told me during the four and a half years that I dealt with it , '' he says . 
`` I also wrote down my views on the available alternatives to war , which were fairly forthright . 
I felt that war should be the last alternative , and emphatically it was not in this case . 
There was a very good alternative to war that was never properly pursued , which was to close down Saddam 's sources of illegal revenue . 
That testimony crystallised what I felt about the Iraq issue , and once I 'd written it I felt there was no going back . 
I had to quit . 
I could n't honestly work for this government with a smile on my face . '' 
It was a bold , some would say foolhardy , step . 
Ross gave up everything - income , status , what he calls the `` grandeur '' of the Foreign Office . 
He wrote to the permanent undersecretary and to the political adviser to the secretary of state stating his reasons for resigning ; neither replied . 
Some former colleagues were `` indifferent to the point of rudeness '' ; he does n't know whether they took his resignation as an implied criticism of their own actions or whether they thought him mad . 
`` I had a very good career under way and it was a huge sacrifice , '' he says . 
`` I 'd always wanted to be a diplomat , so it was a very painful decision . 
I still feel sad about it when I walk past the Foreign Office . 
But in the end I felt I had no choice . 
Although diplomacy and the Foreign Office was a deeply satisfying and enjoyable career , it was n't answering to a deeper part of my soul . '' 
His wife Carmen - a Croatian-born film-maker living in New York when they met - gave Ross the idea of offering his diplomatic skills on a freelance basis . 
Henceforth he would not be beholden to the British government but to his own conscience , and his policy advice would be steered not by national interest but by the alleviation of suffering . 
Independent Diplomat , the slogan of which is `` A diplomatic service for those who need it most '' , was born . 
Ross is currently advising the government of Kosovo and trying to raise awareness of the Saharawi people , displaced by Morocco 's long-standing occupation of the western Sahara . 
He hopes the Rowntree money will enable him to start building a global network of diplomats and lawyers who can help emerging governments or `` political groups struggling to make their case heard '' . 
Independent diplomats will not dissimulate , sit on the fence or hide behind national interests ; their instincts will be to help the marginalised and oppressed ; they will take sides . 
`` I often felt as a British diplomat that the things I really wanted to do were help the people who were less privileged than us , '' he says . 
`` I do n't believe in the received wisdom about what foreign policy is about . 
I do n't believe in things like British interests and the calculus of security and trade and all the rest of it . 
I think it 's mostly manufactured . '' 
He holds up his present preoccupation , the refugees of the western Sahara , as a test case for his new approach . 
`` If you look at these people suffering in a refugee camp in the middle of the desert , most British people would think that was wrong and that something should be done . 
Yet British policy is to do nothing because British interests dictate that fairly minuscule trade with Morocco is more important . 
At the UN I used to perform these calculations myself and send telegrams saying we had no interest in supporting the Saharawi cause . 
At the Foreign Office you are taught to think that trade and market share and security are the most important things , and that human suffering is not important if it 's nothing to do with Britain . 
I disagree with that analysis . 
The best way to a safer and more peaceful world is through alleviating suffering . 
Simplicity is the only thing that works in a complex world . ''

2005-06-20,"Monday 20 June 2005 00.26 BST DHL 's intrepid couriers promise speedy delivery of packages to almost anywhere in the world - including addresses in the war-torn cities of Iraq and Afghanistan . 
But it seems that certain parts of Britain 's inner cities have become no-go areas for the company 's delivery drivers . 
The German-owned company has revealed that some neighborhoods of big cities , including London , Manchester , Birmingham and Glasgow , have been blacklisted because of the risk of couriers being attacked . 
Residents in the Canning Town and Custom House areas of London , for example , were told recently they would have to pick up their packages from a depot amid fears for the safety of DHL staff . 
A DHL spokesman , Matthew Zamoyski , said : `` Mostly , it has been a case of threatening behavior , or people surrounding the vehicle and making life difficult . '' 
He said decisions not to deliver to some areas were taken by local managers , but insisted there was no `` blanket list '' of problem areas . 
`` Where there is an area we have had problems with , the local manager would make a decision that they wo n't deliver for a while until it has settled down , '' he said . 
`` It 's a case of the manager talking to his driver and saying , ` How do you feel about this ? ' 
He might say , ` It 's getting a bit hairy out there , ' and a decision might be made that it 's not safe . '' 
There are thought to be about two dozen postal areas in Britain on the company 's blacklist at any time , but DHL refused to say where they were . 
Many are thought to be council estates and tower blocks in inner-city areas . 
The list is not permanent , and areas can be taken off the list if the situation improves . 
Mr Zamoyski said he was not aware of any surge in attacks . 
DHL was one of the first companies to open in Baghdad after the fall of Saddam Hussein , and also operates in Afghanistan and North Korea . 
The company opened in Baghdad only days after the Iraq war ended . 
One of its transport planes was hit by a shoulder-launched rocket as it left Baghdad airport in November 2003 , but managed to land safely . 
The spokesman said DHL was able to deliver there because of local arrangements . 
He said : '' -LRB- Iraq and Britain -RRB- are very different cases . 
There are local security arrangements applicable in every country , and they differ . '' 
DHL employs more than 170,000 people across the world and can deliver to 220 countries and territories . 
The company , which began couriering in 1969 , takes its name from the initials of the three men who founded it , Adrian Dalsey , Larry Hillblom and Robert Lynn . 
DHL started by shipping papers by plane from San Francisco to Honolulu , but soon expanded across the rest of the world .

2005-06-23,"Thursday 23 June 2005 03.09 BST The war in Iraq is creating a new breed of Islamic jihadists who could go on to destabilise other countries , according to a CIA report . 
The CIA believes Iraq to be potentially worse than Afghanistan , which produced thousands of jihadists in the 1980s and 1990s . 
Many of the recruits to Osama bin Laden 's al-Qaida had fought in Afghanistan . 
The sobering caution came as a senior British anti-terrorism source warned that those trained in terror techniques in Iraq could use their newly-acquired skills in Britain at the end of the war . 
The CIA report , completed last month , remains classified . 
But a CIA source yesterday confirmed that its broad conclusions , disclosed by the New York Times yesterday , were accurate . 
The concern expressed in the CIA report contrasts with the optimism of US defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld two years ago when he welcomed the prospect of Iraq as a magnet for jihadists . 
The Foreign Office and British security services are sceptical about the CIA assessment that the insurgency could spill into other countries . 
Security sources said that there was only a `` trickle '' of recruits from Britain joining the insurgency in Iraq . 
If there was to be a spill-over , Saudi Arabia is potentially vulnerable because many of the Arab fighters in Iraq originate from there . 
Jamal Khashoggi , media adviser to the Saudi ambassador in London , said yesterday he agreed in part with the US assessment . 
`` It will be worse than Afghanistan , '' he said . 
`` We are talking about a very brutal type , a very weird version of Islam in Iraq . 
It is very scary . '' 
Mr Khashoggi predicted the approach of the Saudi government towards jihadists returning from Iraq will be very different from those returning from Afghanistan and Chechnya . 
`` Any al-Qaida coming back from Iraq will be hunted . 
It is not like they have gone to Chechnya and will be coming back as heroes . 
If they come back from Iraq and brag about it , they will be snatched by security in a day or two . '' 
The CIA report suggests the new breed of jihadists will be more deadly than those who fought in Afghanistan . 
It said that they have learned skills in urban warfare in Iraq . 
While the number of Iraq attacks have diminished , they have become more deadly . 
More than 1,000 Iraqis and 120 US soldiers have been killed since the new Iraqi cabinet was formed in April . 
Insurgents once again demonstrated their capacity for inflicting carnage on civilians when they detonated four cars bombs in western Baghdad last night , killing at least 23 people and injuring around 50 . 
At least one was driven by a suicide bomber . 
Earlier a bomb attack on a US military patrol killed three civilians . 
It was claimed by the al-Qaida group led by Abu Musab al Zarqawi . 
There are about 200 individuals in Britain who are suspected of having received training in camps in Afghanistan and Chechnya . 
Senior anti-terrorist officials suggest many fewer have gone to Iraq . 
Ken Jones , the chairman of the Association of Chief Police Officers ' terrorism committee and chief constable of Sussex , said yesterday Britain would remain a prime target . 
`` There is an inevitable targeting of the United Kingdom and UK interests abroad , '' Mr Jones told a conference on terrorism organised by the Royal United Services Institute in London . 
`` The threat will endure for the foreseeable future . '' 
But he added : `` it is not inevitable that they will succeed . '' 
Mr Jones noted that those involved in terrorism no longer necessarily came from the `` excluded and marginalised '' but were increasingly `` highly intelligent , educated young people '' . 
In past terrorist campaigns , he said , there had been a clear goal or aim . 
The new form of attacks required a different response . 
One of the most important ways to combat the growth of terrorism , he suggested , was by encouraging `` confident communities '' - a clear reference to Britain 's Muslims - that would be aware of suspicious activities and would feel confident in reporting them . 
Police in Manchester were last night given another 48 hours to question a 40-year-old man of north African origin , who was arrested under the Terrorism Act on Tuesday . 
It is believed that the man had shared a house in Moss Side with Idris Bazis , 41 , a French-Algerian with a French passport , who blew himself up in a suicide attack in Iraq in February . 
Anti-terrorist sources say there is no link between the Manchester arrest and recent arrests of 11 men in Spain suspected of being connected with the Iraq insurgency . 
Parents of 17 British soldiers killed in Iraq called today in a letter to The Guardian for an independent inquiry into the decision to go to war in Iraq .

2005-06-24,"Two years on , the echoes of Vietnam are getting louder As the Iraq insurgency grows , so do the similarities with Indochina Friday 24 June 2005 00.02 BST A year after the Iraq insurgency began in 2003 , sceptics asked : `` Is this the new Vietnam ? '' 
At the time , many of us who pontificate about these things answered no. . 
Simplistic historical comparisons are almost always mistaken . 
It seemed premature to pass any melodramatic judgment about Iraq . 
Today , another year on , important differences persist . 
The US commitment in Iraq is much smaller than in Vietnam , and so is the casualty rate . 
Half a million Americans spent five years pursuing victory in Indochina , and five more disengaging . 
`` Only '' 140,000 US soldiers are deployed in Iraq . 
George Bush is likely to declare victory and start getting out , rather than escalate his war as Lyndon Johnson so disastrously did . 
Yet in significant respects Vietnam comparisons have become unavoidable . 
First , it is hard to believe that Washington 's objective - the creation of a viable local government and institutions to run Iraq as a unitary state - is achievable within an acceptable time-frame . 
Second , intelligence is proving a critical weakness . 
Recently , I heard an American commander deplore the extraordinary paucity of information on the ground : `` We spend all these billions of dollars on the CIA and your SIS , and we know next to nothing about what the other side is doing . 
We need less technology and more spies . '' 
Third , and most important , whatever military successes American forces achieve against the insurgents , there is no sign that they are winning the critical battle , for hearts and minds . 
The experience of ordinary Iraqis with the US military is at best alienating , at worst terrifying . 
There is no hint of shared purpose , mutual sympathy and respect between the armored columns rolling along the roads , intermittently belching fire , and the hapless mass of local people , caring only for survival . 
Last month , BBC4 screened an uncommonly vivid documentary , A Company of Soldiers , about a unit of the US 8th Cavalry fighting in Iraq . 
It brought all the old memories of Vietnam flooding back . 
These shaven-headed young philistines , fearful and even sometimes tearful , wore on their arms the horse 's head badge of a formation I knew in Indochina as the 1st Air Cavalry Division . 
As the 8th Cavalry 's armored vehicles roared forth on patrol , their occupants seemed infused with the same bewilderment about an unknown enemy that one remembered so well in the boondocks of Indochina . 
These soldiers ' view of Iraq was determined by what they could glimpse through their weapon slits , or at night on their infra-red screens . 
`` We 're trying to save their lives , '' said an exasperated officer about the Iraqis , `` but they 're not helping us by getting in our way . '' 
Soldiers quizzing local people through interpreters on a house search are young men from Ohio or Wyoming , Georgia or New Jersey . 
Yet cocooned in helmets and sunglasses , body armor and weapons that conceal almost every inch of flesh , they do not seem human at all . 
They resemble the robot legionaries of Darth Vader . 
The doctrine of `` force protection '' - making preservation of American lives the first mission priority - has made US forces unconvincing peacekeepers in Somalia and the Balkans , Vietnam and Lebanon . 
So , too , has insensitivity about the interests of the people they are allegedly fighting to help . 
There was a powerful scene in the TV film , in which a bored and jumpy soldier impulsively put a bullet into a dog . 
Its owner emerged from his house , bent over his pet 's corpse for a moment , then walked away , throwing up his hands in impotent misery . 
Whatever commanded that man 's loyalty six months ago , who can doubt which side he is on today . 
`` This is Indian territory ... If we meet the enemy , we shall overwhelm him with combat power , '' said the unit 's colonel , briefing his officers for an operation . 
After an emotional episode in which the whole regiment learned live on the radio about the death on patrol of one of its men , the colonel warned : `` I do n't want to hear anyone say anyone 's dead on the net , right ? '' 
The key imperative for every counter-insurgency campaign is to engage sympathetically with the population . 
`` The only time most Iraqis converse with Americans is when a civil affairs officer comes to pay out compensation for killing somebody in the family , '' a reporter who has spent several months in Iraq observed recently . 
American forces bring nothing in their wake that Iraqis can perceive as good or helpful , only a cacophony of military noise , spasmodic death and destruction . 
In all this , of course , the resemblance to Vietnam is striking . 
US commanders would say more emollient tactics are impossible in the face of an increasingly violent insurgency . 
The suicide bombers , rocket firers and snipers oblige US units tooperate as they do . 
If men went forth on foot , bare-headed , they would pay with their lives . 
This may be true . 
Yet the aim of all insurgencies is to provoke the ruling power to inflict such pain on the civilian population that it forfeits support . 
This is what happened so spectacularly in Vietnam , and what also seems to be happening in Iraq . 
For each of the 1,600 US soldiers killed since Bush declared `` significant combat operations '' at an end more than two years ago , some 20 Iraqis are estimated to have died . 
The warrior culture and firepower of the US army make it almost irresistible in a conventional war , yet disastrously ill-orientated for the sort of the struggle it faces today . 
The more domestic pressure Bush faces , the less inclined will be his commanders in the field to risk exposing their men in human contact with Iraqis . 
I wrote here a few weeks ago that it seemed premature to write off Iraq , even if the omens are grim . 
It remains the case that , however disastrously misconceived was the original decision to invade , to quit precipitately promises anarchy . 
In the US , disillusionment with the war has not - yet , anyway - developed into the sort of national rage that , during Vietnam , destroyed Lyndon Johnson . 
Yet the rival timetables , of rising anti-war feeling at home and lack of progress on the ground are plainly working against the Bush administration . 
Most experts suggest it will take five years , if not more , before Iraqi security forces can conceivably take over from the coalition . 
Who can believe that US opinion will tolerate a commitment on the present scale , a continuing drain of American casualties , for that long ? 
Sir Jeremy Greenstock , the former British senior representative in Iraq , thinks it somewhere between difficult and impossible to remedy US policy failures in the immediate aftermath of the war . 
He is probably right . 
Bush is still many months off being ready to quit and leave the country to resolve its own fate . 
But this is coming to seem the likeliest outcome . 
The most notable irony of a comparison between Indochina and Iraq is that American defeat in 1975 brought about Vietnamese unification , while American failure in Iraq will almost certainly precipitate that country 's fragmentation .

2005-06-25,"Current US megalomania is rooted in the Puritan colonists ' certainties Saturday 25 June 2005 00.37 BST Three continuities link the global US of the cold war era with the attempt to assert world supremacy since 2001 . 
The first is its position of international domination , outside the sphere of influence of communist regimes during the cold war , globally since the collapse of the USSR . 
This hegemony no longer rests on the sheer size of the US economy . 
Large though this is , it has declined since 1945 and its relative decline continues . 
It is no longer the giant of global manufacturing . 
The center of the industrialised world is rapidly shifting to the eastern half of Asia . 
Unlike older imperialist countries , and unlike most other developed industrial countries , the US has ceased to be a net exporter of capital , or indeed the largest player in the international game of buying up or establishing firms in other countries , and the financial strength of the state rests on the continued willingness of others , mostly Asians , to maintain an otherwise intolerable fiscal deficit . 
The influence of the American economy today rests largely on the heritage of the cold war : the role of the US dollar as the world currency , the international linkages of US firms established during that era -LRB- notably in defence-related industries -RRB- , the restructuring of international economic transactions and business practices along American lines , often under the auspices of American firms . 
These are powerful assets , likely to diminish only slowly . 
On the other hand , as the Iraq war showed , the enormous political influence of the US abroad , based as it was on a genuine `` coalition of the willing '' against the USSR , has no similar foundation since the fall of the Berlin wall . 
Only the enormous military-technological power of the US is well beyond challenge . 
It makes the US today the only power capable of effective military intervention at short notice in any part on the world , and it has twice demonstrated its capacity to win small wars with great rapidity . 
And yet , as the Iraq war shows , even this unparalleled capacity to destroy is not enough to impose effective control on a resistant country , and even less on the globe . 
Nevertheless , US dominance is real and the disintegration of the USSR has made it global . 
The second element of continuity is the peculiar house-style of US empire , which has always preferred satellite states or protectorates to formal colonies . 
The expansionism implicit in the name chosen for the 13 independent colonies on the east coast of the Atlantic -LRB- United States of America -RRB- was continental , not colonial . 
The later expansionism of `` manifest destiny '' was both hemispheric and aimed towards East Asia , as well as modelled on the global trading and maritime supremacy of the British Empire . 
One might even say that in its assertion of total US supremacy over the western hemisphere it was too ambitious to be confined to colonial administration over bits of it . 
The American empire thus consisted of technically independent states doing Washington 's bidding , but , given their independence , this required continuous readiness to exert pressure on their governments , including pressure for `` regime change `` and , where feasible -LRB- as in the mini-republics of the Caribbean zone -RRB- , periodic US armed intervention . 
The third thread of continuity links the neo-conservatives of George Bush with the Puritan colonists ' certainty of being God 's instrument on earth and with the American Revolution - which , like all major revolutions , developed world-missionary convictions , limited only by the wish to shield the the new society of potentially universal freedom from the corruptions of the unreconstructed old world . 
The most effective way of finessing this conflict between isolationism and globalism was to be systematically exploited in the 20th century and still serves Washington well in the 21st . 
It was to discover an alien enemy outside who posed an immediate , mortal threat to the American way of life and the lives of its citizens . 
The end of the USSR removed the obvious candidate , but by the early 90s another had been detected in a `` clash '' between the west and other cultures reluctant to accept it , notably Islam . 
Hence the enormous political potential of the al-Qaida outrages of September 11 was immediately recognized and exploited by the Washington world-dominators . 
The first world war , which made the US into a global power , saw the first attempt to translate these world-converting visions into reality , but Woodrow Wilson 's failure was spectacular ; perhaps it should be a lesson to the current world-supremacist ideologists in Washington , who , rightly , recognize Wilson as a predecessor . 
Until the end of the cold war the existence of another superpower imposed limits on them , but the fall of the USSR removed these . 
Francis Fukuyama prematurely proclaimed `` the end of history '' - the universal and permanent triumph of the US version of capitalist society . 
At the same time the military superiority of the US encouraged a disproportionate ambition in a state powerful enough to believe itself capable of world supremacy , as the British Empire in its time never did . 
And indeed , as the 21st century began , the US occupied a historically unique and unprecedented position of global power and influence . 
For the time being it is , by the traditional criteria of international politics , the only great power ; and certainly the only one whose power and interests span the globe . 
It towers over all others . 
All the great powers and empires of history knew that they were not the only ones , and none was in a position to aim at genuinely global domination . 
None believed themselves to be invulnerable . 
Nevertheless , this does not quite explain the evident megalomania of US policy since a group of Washington insiders decided that September 11 gave them the ideal opportunity for declaring its single-handed domination of the world . 
For one thing , it lacked the support of the traditional pillars of the post-1945 US empire , the state department , armed services and intelligence establishment , and of the statesmen and ideologists of cold war supremacy - men like Kissinger and Brzezinski . 
These were people who were as ruthless as the Rumsfelds and Wolfowitzes . 
-LRB- It was in their time that a genocide of Mayas took place in Guatemala in the 1980s . -RRB- 
They had devised and managed a policy of imperial hegemony over the greater part of the globe for two generations , and were perfectly ready to extend it to the entire globe . 
They were and are critical of the Pentagon planners and neo-conservative world supremacists because these patently have had no concrete ideas at all , except imposing their supremacy single-handed by military force , incidentally jettisoning all the accumulated experience of US diplomacy and military planning . 
No doubt the debacle of Iraq will confirm them in their scepticism . 
Even those who do not share the views of the old generals and proconsuls of the US world empire -LRB- which were those of Democratic as well as Republican administrations -RRB- will agree that there can be no rational justification of current Washington policy in terms of the interests of America 's imperial ambitions or , for that matter , the global interests of US capitalism . 
It may be that it makes sense only in terms of the calculations , electoral or otherwise , of American domestic policy . 
It may be a symptom of a more profound crisis within US society . 
It may be that it represents the - one hopes short-lived - colonisation of Washington power by a group of quasi-revolutionary doctrinaires . 
-LRB- At least one passionate ex-Marxist supporter of Bush has told me , only half in jest : `` After all , this is the only chance of supporting world revolution that looks like coming my way . '' -RRB- 
Such questions can not yet be answered . 
It is reasonably certain that the project will fail . 
However , while it continues , it will go on making the world an intolerable place for those directly exposed to US armed occupation and an unsafer place for the rest of us .

2005-06-27,"Monday 27 June 2005 01.32 BST The US defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , yesterday warned that the insurgency in Iraq could go on for at least a decade and confirmed that the army had been in contact with some of its leaders in an attempt to quell the violence . 
He spoke after insurgents launched coordinated suicide bomb attacks which killed at least 33 people and wounded dozens more in the northern city of Mosul . 
Mr Rumsfeld said that Iraqis , not US troops , would eventually bring an end to attacks that have killed thousands of civilians and 1,730 American soldiers . 
His downbeat assessment , during a television interview , was in stark contrast to a claim at the end of May by the vice presiden , Dick Cheney , that the insurgency was `` in its last throes '' . 
Mr Rumsfeld said : `` We 're not going to win against the insurgency . 
The Iraqi people are going to win against the insurgency . 
That insurgency could go on for any number of years . 
Insurgencies tend to go on five , six , eight , 10 , 12 years . '' 
Mr Rumsfeld confirmed that US officials were taking part in talks with insurgent leaders in Iraq . 
Asked about a report of two such meetings in yesterday 's Sunday Times , he told Fox News : `` Well , the first thing I would say about the meetings is they go on all the time . '' 
He added that Iraq had a sovereign government which could choose its own relationships with different groups of insurgents . 
`` We facilitate those from time to time , '' Mr Rumsfeld said . 
Al-Qaida in Iraq and another Sunni extremist group , the Ansar al-Sunnah army , both issued statements on militant Islamic websites yesterday denying having held talks with US or Iraqi government officials . 
Mr Rumsfeld made it clear that the talks had been with Iraqi insurgents rather than foreign fighters led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , a Jordanian extremist . 
He told NBC television 's Meet the Press program : `` It is n't a matter of negotiating with terrorists . 
There 's no one negotiating with Zarqawi or the people that are out chopping people 's heads off . '' 
General John Abizaid , the commander of US forces in the Middle East said that both US and Iraqi officials were `` looking for the right people in the Sunni community to talk to ... and clearly we know that the vast majority of the insurgents are from the Sunni Arab community . '' 
Amid steadily declining support for the war in the US and conflicting signals from the Bush administration , Mr Rumsfeld went out of his way to lower American expectations of a quick victory . 
He said : `` We 're going to create an environment that the Iraqi people and the Iraqi security forces can win against that insurgency . '' 
US war objectives have been ratcheted down in recent months from establishing stability in Iraq to training sufficient numbers of Iraqi government troops to fight the insurgency independently . 
The policy of lowering expectations however was thrown into confusion by Mr Cheney 's claim that the insurgency was `` in its last throes '' . 
The claim appeared to take other administration officials by surprise and forced them into a string of semantic contortions to explain it . 
`` The fact is that if you look at the context of his remarks , last throes could be a violent last throe , just as well as a placid or calm last throe . 
Look it up in the dictionary , '' Mr Rumsfeld said yesterday . 
He added : `` There 's no question but that the enemy is a thinking enemy , that their attacks are more lethal than they had been previously . 
They 're killing a lot more Iraqis . '' 
The defense secretary 's back-to-back television appearances were part of a concerted administration campaign to convince the American public it has a winning strategy in Iraq amid falling home support . 
That public relations campaign will reach its peak tomorrow night with a prime-time address to the nation by President George Bush , who will call for popular resolve in support of the nation 's 135,000 troops still in Iraq . 
"
2005-06-29,"Terror link used to rally sceptical US public Wednesday 29 June 2005 09.02 BST George Bush delivers a televised address to the nation at Fort Bragg , North Carolina . 
Photograph : Tim Sloan\/AFP\/Getty George Bush last night rallied Americans to the cause of the Iraq war , urging them not to forget the lessons of September 11 '' and arguing the fight was vital to future US security . 
Addressing the nation from Fort Bragg military base in North Carolina , President Bush confronted head on America 's growing pessimism and uncertainty over the war . 
Again and again in his primetime speech , the president attempted to bind the Iraq counter-insurgency to the broader `` war on terror '' started by the September 11 attacks , trying to rebuild a connection in the public mind that has given way to scepticism about the justification for the invasion . 
`` This war reached our shores on September 11 2001 , '' Mr Bush said , pointing to links between Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , Jordanian extremist thought be behind many of the suicide attacks in Iraq , and Osama bin Laden . 
`` The only way our enemies can succeed is if we forget the lessons of September ... if we abandon the Iraqi people to men like Zarqawi ... and if we yield the future of the Middle East to men like Bin Laden , '' the president said . 
The president set out a two track strategy for victory . 
The military track would be focused on accelerating the work training Iraqi troops . 
The president spoke of three specific steps . 
Iraqi units were being `` partnered '' with coalition troops in combined operations . 
Second , coalition `` transition teams '' of coalition officers and non-commissioned officers would `` live , work , and fight together with their Iraqi comrades '' . 
And third , the Iraqi defense and interior ministries would be given support specifically for counter-terrorist operations . 
The political track involved supporting Iraqi politicians in formulating a constitution , involving more Sunni Arabs in the process , paving the way for referendum and elections . 
He was facing a sceptical audience . 
Most analysts believe the threat posed to the US by al-Zarqawi is more a consequence of the 2003 invasion than a justification for it . 
A majority of Americans now agree that there was no solid link between the 2001 terrorist attacks and Iraq , and most no longer think the war Iraq is worth the cost in American lives . 
Mr Bush insisted it is . 
`` Amid all this violence , I know Americans ask the question : Is the sacrifice worth it ? 
It is worth it , and it is vital to the future security of our country , '' he said . 
But Americans who watched the presidential address would also have seen the latest bad news from Iraq . 
A suicide bomber assassinated Iraq 's oldest MP , Dhari al-Fayadh , on his way to parliament yesterday , sending a message that none of the politicians working against the clock to agree a constitution are safe . 
In Afghanistan , a US military helicopter carrying 16 troops was reported to have crashed in the Hindu Kush mountains near the Pakistan border . 
Taliban guerrillas were claiming to have shot down the CH-47 Chinook troop transporter as rescue parties headed into the mountains . 
In Baghdad , a vehicle packed with explosives incinerated a car carrying Mr Fayadh , 87 , killing him , his son and three bodyguards on the anniversary of last year 's US handover of power to an interim government . 
At least eight other Iraqis , mostly police officers , died in separate attacks . 
By targeting the assembly 's former speaker and a Shia tribal leader , insurgents shook the fledgling political establishment and inflamed sectarian tensions . 
The assassination also darkened the grim backdrop to Mr Bush 's speech . 
`` We have more work to do , and there will be tough moments that test America 's resolve , '' he said , calling for a rekindling of the spirit of national unity and resolve that followed the al-Qaida attacks on New York and Washington . 
`` They are trying to shake our will in Iraq , just as they tried to shake our will on September 11 2001 . 
The terrorists do not understand America . 
The American people do not falter under threat and we will not allow our future to be determined by car bombers and assassins . '' 
Mr Bush was attempting to reverse a growing slump in public support for the war . 
Two polls yesterday showed greater scepticism than ever . 
Only one in three Americans believe the US and its allies are winning the war , down nine percentage points since February , according to a Gallup poll .

2005-06-29,"Full text : George Bush 's Iraq speech Full text of President George Bush 's speech at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , as provided by the White House Wednesday 29 June 2005 03.07 BST Thank you and good evening . 
I am pleased to visit Fort Bragg , home of the Airborne and Special Operations Forces . 
It is an honor to speak before you tonight . 
My greatest responsibility as president is to protect the American people , and that is your calling as well . 
I thank you for your service , your courage and your sacrifice . 
I thank your families , who support you in your vital work . 
The soldiers and families of Fort Bragg have contributed mightily to our efforts to secure our country and promote peace . 
America is grateful and so is your commander in chief . 
The troops here and across the world are fighting a global war on terror . 
This war reached our shores on September 11 2001 . 
The terrorists who attacked us and the terrorists we face murder in the name of a totalitarian ideology that hates freedom , rejects tolerance and despises all dissent . 
Their aim is to remake the Middle East in their own grim image of tyranny and oppression by toppling governments , driving us out of the region and exporting terror . 
To achieve these aims , they have continued to kill in Madrid , Istanbul , Jakarta , Casablanca , Riyadh , Bali and elsewhere . 
The terrorists believe that free societies are essentially corrupt and decadent , and with a few hard blows they can force us to retreat . 
After September 11 , I made a commitment to the American people : This nation will not wait to be attacked again . 
We will take the fight to the enemy . 
We will defend our freedom . 
Iraq is the latest battlefield in this war . 
Many terrorists who kill innocent men , women and children on the streets of Baghdad are followers of the same murderous ideology that took the lives of our citizens in New York , Washington and Pennsylvania . 
There is only one course of action against them : to defeat them abroad before they attack us at home . 
The commander in charge of coalition operations in Iraq , who is also senior commander at this base , General John Vines , put it well the other day . 
He said , `` We either deal with terrorism and this extremism abroad , or we deal with it when it comes to us . '' 
Our mission in Iraq is clear . 
We are hunting down the terrorists . 
We are helping Iraqis build a free nation that is an ally in the war on terror . 
We are advancing freedom in the broader Middle East . 
We are removing a source of violence and instability and laying the foundation of peace for our children and our grandchildren . 
The work in Iraq is difficult and dangerous . 
Like most Americans , I see the images of violence and bloodshed . 
Every picture is horrifying and the suffering is real . 
Amid all this violence , I know Americans ask the question : Is the sacrifice worth it ? 
It is worth it , and it is vital to the future security of our country . 
And tonight I will explain the reasons why . 
Some of the violence you see in Iraq is being carried out by ruthless killers who are converging on Iraq to fight the advance of peace and freedom . 
Our military reports that we have killed or captured hundreds of foreign fighters in Iraq who have come from Saudi Arabia , Syria , Iran , Egypt , Sudan , Yemen , Libya and other nations . 
They are making common cause with criminal elements , Iraqi insurgents and remnants of Saddam Hussein 's regime who want to restore the old order . 
They fight because they know that the survival of their hateful ideology is at stake . 
They know that as freedom takes root in Iraq , it will inspire millions across the Middle East to claim their liberty as well . 
And when the Middle East grows in democracy , prosperity and hope , the terrorists will lose their sponsors , lose their recruits and lose their hopes for turning that region into a base for attacks on America and our allies around the world . 
Some wonder whether Iraq is a central front in the war on terror . 
Among the terrorists , there is no debate . 
Hear the words of Osama Bin Laden : `` This Third World War is raging '' in Iraq . 
`` The whole world is watching this war . '' 
He says it will end in `` victory and glory or misery and humiliation . '' 
The terrorists know that the outcome will leave them emboldened or defeated . 
So they are waging a campaign of murder and destruction . 
And there is no limit to the innocent lives they are willing to take . 
We see the nature of the enemy in terrorists who exploded car bombs along a busy shopping street in Baghdad , including one outside a mosque . 
We see the nature of the enemy in terrorists who sent a suicide bomber to a teaching hospital in Mosul . 
And we see the nature of the enemy in terrorists who behead civilian hostages and broadcast their atrocities for the world to see . 
These are savage acts of violence but they have not brought the terrorists any closer to achieving their strategic objectives . 
The terrorists , both foreign and Iraqi , failed to stop the transfer of sovereignty . 
They failed to break our coalition and force a mass withdrawal by our allies . 
They failed to incite an Iraqi civil war . 
They failed to prevent free elections . 
They failed to stop the formation of a democratic Iraqi government that represents all of Iraq 's diverse population . 
And they failed to stop Iraqis from signing up in large numbers with the police forces and the army to defend their new democracy . 
The lesson of this experience is clear : The terrorists can kill the innocent but they can not stop the advance of freedom . 
The only way our enemies can succeed is if we forget the lessons of September 11 , if we abandon the Iraqi people to men like Zarqawi and if we yield the future of the Middle East to men like bin Laden . 
For the sake of our nation 's security , this will not happen on my watch . 
A little over a year ago , I spoke to the nation and described our coalition 's goal in Iraq . 
I said that America 's mission in Iraq is to defeat an enemy and give strength to a friend , a free , representative government that is an ally in the war on terror and a beacon of hope in a part of the world that is desperate for reform . 
I outlined the steps we would take to achieve this goal : We would hand authority over to a sovereign Iraqi government ; we would help Iraqis hold free elections by January 2005 ; we would continue helping Iraqis rebuild their nation 's infrastructure and economy ; we would encourage more international support for Iraq 's democratic transition ; and we would enable Iraqis to take increasing responsibility for their own security and stability . 
In the past year , we have made significant progress : One year ago today , we restored sovereignty to the Iraqi people . 
In January 2005 , more than 8 million Iraqi men and women voted in elections that were free and fair and took place on time . 
We continued our efforts to help them rebuild their country . 
Rebuilding a country after three decades of tyranny is hard and rebuilding while at war is even harder . 
Our progress has been uneven but progress is being made . 
We are improving roads and schools and health clinics and working to improve basic services like sanitation , electricity and water . 
And together with our allies , we will help the new Iraqi government deliver a better life for its citizens . 
In the past year , the international community has stepped forward with vital assistance . 
Some 30 nations have troops in Iraq , and many others are contributing nonmilitary assistance . 
The United Nations is in Iraq to help Iraqis write a constitution and conduct their next elections . 
Thus far , some 40 countries and three international organizations have pledged about 34 billion dollars in assistance for Iraqi reconstruction . 
More than 80 countries and international organizations recently came together in Brussels to coordinate their efforts to help Iraqis provide for their security and rebuild their country . 
And next month , donor countries will meet in Jordan to support Iraqi reconstruction . 
Whatever our differences in the past , the world understands that success in Iraq is critical to the security of all our nations . 
As German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said at the White House yesterday , `` There can be no question a stable and democratic Iraq is in the vested interest of not just Germany , but also Europe . '' 
Finally , we have continued our efforts to equip and train Iraqi security forces . 
We have made gains in both the number and quality of those forces . 
Today Iraq has more than 160,000 security forces trained and equipped for a variety of missions . 
Iraqi forces have fought bravely helping to capture terrorists and insurgents in Najaf , Samarra , Fallujah and Mosul . 
And in the past month , Iraqi forces have led a major anti-terrorist campaign in Baghdad called Operation Lightning , which has led to the capture of hundreds of suspected insurgents . 
Like free people everywhere , Iraqis want to be defended by their own countrymen , and we are helping Iraqis assume those duties . 
The progress in the past year has been significant and we have a clear path forward . 
To complete the mission , we will continue to hunt down the terrorists and insurgents . 
To complete the mission , we will prevent al-Qaida and other foreign terrorists from turning Iraq into what Afghanistan was under the Taliban - a safe haven from which they could launch attacks on America and our friends . 
And the best way to complete the mission is to help Iraqis build a free nation that can govern itself , sustain itself and defend itself . 
So our strategy going forward has both a military track and a political track . 
The principal task of our military is to find and defeat the terrorists and that is why we are on the offense . 
And as we pursue the terrorists , our military is helping to train Iraqi security forces so that they can defend their people and fight the enemy on their own . 
Our strategy can be summed up this way : As the Iraqis stand up , we will stand down . 
We have made progress but we have a lot more work to do . 
Today Iraqi security forces are at different levels of readiness . 
Some are capable of taking on the terrorists and insurgents by themselves . 
A larger number can plan and execute anti-terrorist operations with coalition support . 
The rest are forming and not yet ready to participate fully in security operations . 
Our task is to make the Iraqi units fully capable and independent . 
We are building up Iraqi security forces as quickly as possible , so they can assume the lead in defeating the terrorists and insurgents . 
Our coalition is devoting considerable resources and manpower to this critical task . 
Thousands of coalition troops are involved in the training and equipping of Iraqi security forces . 
Nato is establishing a military academy near Baghdad to train the next generation of Iraqi military leaders , and 17 nations are contributing troops to the Nato training mission . 
Iraqi army and police are being trained by personnel from Italy , Germany , Ukraine , Turkey , Poland , Romania , Australia and the United Kingdom . 
Today dozens of nations are working toward a common objective : an Iraq that can defend itself , defeat its enemies and secure its freedom . 
To further prepare Iraqi forces to fight the enemy on their own , we are taking three new steps : First , we are partnering coalition units with Iraqi units . 
These coalition-Iraqi teams are conducting operations together in the field . 
These combined operations are giving Iraqis a chance to experience how the most professional armed forces in the world operate in combat . 
Second , we are embedding coalition `` transition teams '' inside Iraqi units . 
These teams are made up of coalition officers and noncommissioned officers who live , work and fight together with their Iraqi comrades . 
Under US command , they are providing battlefield advice and assistance to Iraqi forces during combat operations . 
Between battles , they are assisting the Iraqis with important skills such as urban combat and intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance techniques . 
Third , we are working with the Iraqi Ministries of Interior and Defense to improve their capabilities to coordinate anti-terrorist operations . 
We are helping them develop command and control structures . 
We are also providing them with civilian and military leadership training , so Iraq 's new leaders can more effectively manage their forces in the fight against terror . 
The new Iraqi security forces are proving their courage every day . 
More than 2,000 members of the Iraqi security forces have given their lives in the line of duty . 
Thousands more have stepped forward and are now in training to serve their nation . 
With each engagement , Iraqi soldiers grow more battle-hardened and their officers grow more experienced . 
We have learned that Iraqis are courageous and that they need additional skills . 
That is why a major part of our mission is to train them so they can do the fighting and our troops can come home . 
I recognize that Americans want our troops to come home as quickly as possible . 
So do I. Some contend that we should set a deadline for withdrawing US forces . 
Let me explain why that would be a serious mistake . 
Setting an artificial timetable would send the wrong message to the Iraqis , who need to know that America will not leave before the job is done . 
It would send the wrong message to our troops , who need to know that we are serious about completing the mission they are risking their lives to achieve . 
And it would send the wrong message to the enemy , who would know that all they have to do is to wait us out . 
We will stay in Iraq as long as we are needed and not a day longer . 
Some Americans ask me , if completing the mission is so important , why do n't you send more troops ? 
If our commanders on the ground say we need more troops , I will send them . 
But our commanders tell me they have the number of troops they need to do their job . 
Sending more Americans would undermine our strategy of encouraging Iraqis to take the lead in this fight . 
And sending more Americans would suggest that we intend to stay forever , when we are in fact working for the day when Iraq can defend itself and we can leave . 
As we determine the right force level , our troops can know that I will continue to be guided by the advice that matters : the sober judgement of our military leaders . 
The other critical element of our strategy is to help ensure that the hopes Iraqis expressed at the polls in January are translated into a secure democracy . 
The Iraqi people are emerging from decades of tyranny and oppression . 
Under the regime of Saddam Hussein , the Shia and Kurds were brutally oppressed and the vast majority of Sunni Arabs were also denied their basic rights , while senior regime officials enjoyed the privileges of unchecked power . 
The challenge facing Iraqis today is to put this past behind them and come together to build a new Iraq that includes all its people . 
They are doing that by building the institutions of a free society , a society based on freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , freedom of religion and equal justice under law . 
The Iraqis have held free elections and established a transitional national assembly . 
The next step is to write a good constitution that enshrines these freedoms in permanent law . 
The assembly plans to expand its constitutional drafting committee to include more Sunni Arabs . 
Many Sunnis who opposed the January elections are now taking part in the democratic process , and that is essential to Iraq 's future . 
After a constitution is written , the Iraqi people will have a chance to vote on it . 
If approved , Iraqis will go to the polls again to elect a new government under their new , permanent constitution . 
By taking these critical steps and meeting their deadlines , Iraqis will bind their multiethnic society together in a democracy that respects the will of the majority and protects minority rights . 
As Iraqis grow confident that the democratic progress they are making is real and permanent , more will join the political process . 
And as Iraqis see that their military can protect them , more will step forward with vital intelligence to help defeat the enemies of a free Iraq . 
The combination of political and military reform will lay a solid foundation for a free and stable Iraq . 
As Iraqis make progress toward a free society , the effects are being felt beyond Iraq 's borders . 
Before our coalition liberated Iraq , Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons . 
Today the leader of Libya has given up his chemical and nuclear weapons programs . 
Across the broader Middle East , people are claiming their freedom . 
In the last few months , we have witnessed elections in the Palestinian territories and Lebanon . 
These elections are inspiring democratic reformers in places like Egypt and Saudi Arabia . 
Our strategy to defend ourselves and spread freedom is working . 
The rise of freedom in this vital region will eliminate the conditions that feed radicalism and ideologies of murder and make our nation safer . 
We have more work to do , and there will be tough moments that test America 's resolve . 
We are fighting against men with blind hatred and armed with lethal weapons who are capable of any atrocity . 
They wear no uniform ; they respect no laws of warfare or morality . 
They take innocent lives to create chaos for the cameras . 
They are trying to shake our will in Iraq just as they tried to shake our will on September 11 2001 . 
The terrorists do not understand America . 
The American people do not falter under threat and we will not allow our future to be determined by car bombers and assassins . 
America and our friends are in a conflict that demands much of us . 
It demands the courage of our fighting men and women , it demands the steadfastness of our allies and it demands the perseverance of our citizens . 
We accept these burdens because we know what is at stake . 
We fight today because Iraq now carries the hope of freedom in a vital region of the world , and the rise of democracy will be the ultimate triumph over radicalism and terror . 
And we fight today because terrorists want to attack our country and kill our citizens , and Iraq is where they are making their stand . 
So we will fight them there , we will fight them across the world and we will stay in the fight until the fight is won . 
America has done difficult work before . 
From our desperate fight for independence , to the darkest days of a Civil War , to the hard-fought battles against tyranny in the 20th century , there were many chances to lose our heart , our nerve or our way . 
But Americans have always held firm , because we have always believed in certain truths . 
We know that if evil is not confronted , it gains in strength and audacity and returns to strike us again . 
We know that when the work is hard , the proper response is not retreat , it is courage . 
And we know that this great ideal of human freedom is entrusted to us in a special way and that the ideal of liberty is worth defending . 
In this time of testing , our troops can know : The American people are behind you . 
Next week , our nation has an opportunity to make sure that support is felt by every soldier , sailor , airman , Coast Guardsman and Marine at every outpost across the world . 
This Fourth of July , I ask you to find a way to thank the men and women defending our freedom by flying the flag , sending letters to our troops in the field or helping the military family down the street . 
The Department of Defense has set up a website , AmericaSupportsYou . 
You can go there to learn about private efforts in your own community . 
At this time when we celebrate our freedom , let us stand with the men and women who defend us all . 
To the soldiers in this hall , and our servicemen and women across the globe : I thank you for your courage under fire and your service to our nation . 
I thank our military families ; the burden of war falls especially hard on you . 
In this war , we have lost good men and women who left our shores to defend freedom and did not live to make the journey home . 
I have met with families grieving the loss of loved ones who were taken from us too soon . 
I have been inspired by their strength in the face of such great loss . 
We pray for the families . 
And the best way to honor the lives that have been given in this struggle is to complete the mission . 
I thank those of you who have re-enlisted in an hour when your country needs you . 
And to those watching tonight who are considering a military career , there is no higher calling than service in our Armed Forces . 
We live in freedom because every generation has produced patriots willing to serve a cause greater than themselves . 
Those who serve today are taking their rightful place among the greatest generations that have worn our nation 's uniform . 
When the history of this period is written , the liberation of Afghanistan and the liberation of Iraq will be remembered as great turning points in the story of freedom . 
After September 11 2001 , I told the American people that the road ahead would be difficult and that we would prevail . 
Well , it has been difficult . 
And we are prevailing . 
Our enemies are brutal , but they are no match for the United States of America and they are no match for the men and women of the United States military . 
And may God bless America .

2005-06-30,"Doubts cast on success of speech in halting slide against conflict Thursday 30 June 2005 03.14 BST Leading Democrats yesterday reacted angrily to President George Bush 's address to the nation , accusing him of `` exploiting the sacred ground '' of September 11 by attempting to link the Iraq war with the terrorist attacks . 
In his prime-time speech at Fort Bragg military base , the president mentioned September 11 five times in 30 minutes as he argued that withdrawal from Iraq would leave the US open to more terrorist attacks . 
The twitchy mood in Washington was underscored yesterday when the White House was briefly evacuated - and Mr Bush moved to a safe location - in the latest aviation alert to hit the capital . 
The all-clear was rapidly sounded when the airspace rogue proved to be an innocuous private aircraft . 
Instant polls after Mr Bush 's speech suggested that he might have solidified support among the largely Republican audience who watched the performance , but it was unclear whether he had made headway against a steadily advancing tide of scepticism about the justification for the war . 
Democrats argued that he had offered no new ideas on how to beat the insurgency . 
They pointed to the administration 's lack of credibility over Iraq in the wake of post-war inquiries that found no weapons of mass destruction and no substantive prewar links between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida . 
Nancy Pelosi , the minority leader in the House of Representatives , said Mr Bush was trying to `` exploit the sacred ground of 9\/11 , knowing that there is no connection between 9\/11 and the war in Iraq '' . 
In his speech , Mr Bush did not repeat his administration 's prewar claims of a direct Iraqi role in the September 11 attacks . 
Instead , he suggested that the insurgents shared a common `` totalitarian ideology '' with al-Qaida , and that if they were not defeated in Iraq they could use the country as a base from which to launch terrorist attacks on the US homeland . 
Senator John Kerry , Mr Bush 's opponent in last November 's election , said the speech represented the administration 's third rationale for the 2003 invasion . 
`` The first , of course , was weapons of mass destruction . 
The second was democracy , and now , tonight , it 's to combat the hotbed of terrorism , '' he told CNN . 
`` But most Americans are aware that the hotbed of terrorism never existed in Iraq until we got there . '' 
Senator Joseph Biden , the Democrats ' leading voice on foreign policy , predicted that the martial rhetoric would not rescue the president 's standing in the polls , where Mr Bush has lower ratings than presidents Reagan or Clinton at this stage of their second terms . 
`` I think the American people are a lot smarter than that , '' he said . 
However , Andrew Kohut , head of the Pew Research Centre , a Washington polling organization , said the broader ties outlined by the president might strike a chord with the public . 
`` For many Americans the premise for the war was that Saddam Hussein was a dangerous man and we are better off without him , '' he said . 
`` It was not so much premised on a direct link between Saddam and al-Qaida , as on the suggestion that we face a threat from that part of the world and if we leave a mess it will be a danger to us . '' 
Though one poll showed that the speech drew the smallest audience of any Bush presidential appearance , another poll by Gallup found that it may have served its purpose in bolstering the resolve of viewers , at least temporarily . 
Of an estimated 23 million who watched , 54 % thought the US was winning the war , compared with 44 % before the speech . 
But only 23 % were registered Democrats - and the boost the president received was weak compared with the upsurge following similar set-piece speeches in the past . 
The address was also savaged abroad . 
A Labor MP , Lynne Jones , said any attempt to suggest that it was a response to the September 11 attacks was `` absolute nonsense '' . 
`` What they have ensured , in invading Iraq , is they have actually promoted al-Qaida 's involvement in other countries , including Iraq . ''

2005-07-03,"Revealed : grim world of new Iraqi torture camps Secret torture chambers , the brutal interrogation of prisoners , murders by paramilitaries with links to powerful ministries ... Foreign affairs editor Peter Beaumont in Baghdad uncovers a grim trail of abuse carried out by forces loyal to the new Iraqi government Sunday 3 July 2005 02.22 BST The video camera pans across Hassan an-Ni ` ami 's body as it is washed in the mosque for burial . 
In life he was a slender , good-looking man , usually dressed in a dark robe and white turban , Imam at a mosque in Baghdad 's Adhimiya district and a senior official of the Muslim Clerics Association . 
When I first interviewed him a year ago he was suspected of contacts with the insurgency . 
Certainly he supported resistance to US forces . 
More recently , an-Ni ` ami had dropped out of sight . 
Then , a little over a month ago , relatives say , paramilitary police commandos from ` Rapid Intrusion ' found him at a family home in the Sha'ab neighborhood of northern Baghdad . 
His capture was reported on television as that of a senior ` terrorist commander ' . 
Twelve hours later his body turned up in the morgue . 
What happened to him in his 24 hours in captivity was written across his body in chapters of pain , recorded by the camera . 
There are police-issue handcuffs still attached to one wrist , from which he was hanged long enough to cause his hands and wrists to swell . 
There are burn marks on his chest , as if someone has placed something very hot near his right nipple and moved it around . 
A little lower are a series of horizontal welts , wrapping around his body and breaking the skin as they turn around his chest , as if he had been beaten with something flexible , perhaps a cable . 
There are other injuries : a broken nose and smaller wounds that look like cigarette burns . 
An arm appears to have been broken and one of the higher vertebrae is pushed inwards . 
There is a cluster of small , neat circular wounds on both sides of his left knee . 
At some stage an-Ni ` ami seems to have been efficiently knee-capped . 
It was not done with a gun - the exit wounds are identical in size to the entry wounds , which would not happen with a bullet . 
Instead it appears to have been done with something like a drill . 
What actually killed him however were the bullets fired into his chest at close range , probably by someone standing over him as he lay on the ground . 
The last two hit him in the head . 
The gruesome detail is important . 
Hanging by the arms in cuffs , scorching of the body with something like an iron and knee-capping are claimed to be increasingly prevalent in the new Iraq . 
Now evidence is emerging that appears to substantiate those claims . 
Not only Iraqis make the allegations . 
International officials describe the methods in disgusted but hushed tones , laying them at the door of the increasingly unaccountable forces attached to Iraq 's Ministry of the Interior . 
The only question that remains is the level of the co-ordination of the abuse : whether Iraq is stumbling towards a policy of institutionalised torture or whether these are incidents carried out by rogue elements . 
Six months ago , Human Rights Watch -LRB- HRW -RRB- laid out a catalogue of alleged abuses being applied to those suspected of terrorism in Iraq and called for an independent complaints body in Iraq . 
But as the insurgency has grown hotter , so too , it appears , have been the methods employed in the dirty counter-insurgency war . 
To add to HRW 's allegations of beatings , electric shocks , arbitrary arrest , forced confessions and detention without trial , The Observer can add its own charges These include the most brutal kinds of torture , with methods resurrected from the time of Saddam ; of increasingly widespread extra-judicial executions ; and of the existence of a ` ghost ' network of detention facilities - in parallel with those officially acknowledged - that exist beyond all accountability to international human rights monitors , NGOs and even human rights officials of the new Iraqi government . 
What is most shocking is that it is done under the noses of US and UK officials , some of whom admit that they are aware of the abuses being perpetrated by units who are diverting international funding to their dirty war . 
Hassan an-Ni ` ami may well have been a terrorist . 
Or he may have had knowledge of that terrorism . 
Or he may have been someone who objected too loudly to foreign troops being in Iraq . 
We will never know . 
He had no opportunity to defend himself , no lawyer , no trial . 
His interrogation and killing were a breach of international law . 
And it is not only the case of an-Ni ` ami but others too , all arrested by units of the Ministry of the Interior , many of whom were tortured and subsequently killed . 
Post-mortem images show a dozen or so farmers from the insurgent hotbed of Medayeen who were apparently seized by police as they slept in one of Baghdad 's markets and whose bodies were discovered on a rubbish dump in shallow graves to the north of the city . 
Like an-Ni ` ami , their bodies also bore the marks of extensive torture before execution , most with a bullet to the head . 
The face of the first body is blackened by strangulation or asphyxiation . 
Another has bruises to his forehead where he was been hit repeatedly with something heavy . 
Yet another , his hands still tied with cord , has been punched in the eye and had his ankle fractured . 
Yet another shows signs of burning similar to an-Ni ` ami 's . 
The last two have identical puncture wounds , fist-width apart , suggesting the use of a spiked knuckle-duster . 
Then there is Tahar Mohammed Suleiman al-Mashhadani , seized from the Abu Ghraib neighborhood from early prayers outside a mosque with a number of other men , again by paramilitary police from Rapid Intrusion . 
When his body was found by family members in the morgue - 20 days after his arrest - he had been tortured almost beyond recognition . 
These are not isolated cases . 
For what is extraordinary is the sense of impunity with which the torture , intimidation and murder is taking place . 
It is not just in Baghdad . 
In the majority Shia south , far from the worst ravages of the insurgency , there are also emerging reports consistent with the abuses in the capital . 
If there is a center to this horror , it is Baghdad 's Ministry of the Interior , and the police commando units that operate from there . 
The ministry is a strange , top-heavy building , set apart in an area of open ground off the highway . 
Its entrance is guarded by concrete blast-walls and endless checkpoints on the dusty road that leads to its crowded reception . 
I came here almost exactly a year ago , two days after sovereignty had been handed back to Iraq 's interim government . 
The floors were occupied by civil servants and blue-uniformed officers of the Iraqi Police Service . 
It was easy to wander in . 
These days the ministry is a very different place . 
The dusty hinterland that leads to it is busy with the new paramilitary forces that most often have been accused of human rights abuses - the Rapid Intrusion brigades , most notoriously the Wolf Brigade of ` Abu Walid ' . 
There has been no investigation or official findings over the allegations . 
It was here - 12 months ago - that there was the first intimation that something was going seriously wrong . 
On the second day of Iraq 's new government , US military police were forced to raid the Guest House to ` rescue ' dozens of alleged criminals , scooped up in a sweep of the city , who were being subjected to beatings and forced confessions of their crimes . 
Back then officials were happy to justify the violence - and angry at the US intervention . 
Criminals and terrorists expected a good beating , one official said , proud of his 100 per cent confession rate . 
Now it is impossible to reach those officials as they shelter on heavily guarded floors . 
There are no American MPs to come to the aid of those locked in the cells . 
A year ago , the worst violence was meted out in the Guest House . 
Now officials say the abuse happens on the seventh floor , where those suspected of terrorist connections are brought . 
One of those held at the ministry for ` terrorist interrogation ' is ` Zaid ' . 
It is not his real name . 
Since his release , the 25-year-old Sunni from the western suburbs of Baghdad lives in fear of being brought back . 
A taxi driver , the college graduate stopped his car in March to buy food in a market . 
When a bomb exploded nearby , he went to look at the damage . 
Arrested at the scene by soldiers from the Iraqi National Guard , he says he was handed over to the Ministry of the Interior . 
At first , said Zaid , he was put in a room , on the seventh floor , measuring 10ft by 12ft , with 60 others . 
He was crammed in so tightly he could not sit . 
In some respects Zaid was lucky . 
Early in his detention , a Ministry of Justice official appeared and , furious at the conditions , demanded the men be moved . 
` He said , `` You ca n't have this many people in a room this size , '' so they moved us to somewhere with more air and fed us . 
He asked too whether there had been any beatings and some said yes . ' 
For his part , Zaid says he was hung by his arms , but not for so long that it caused any permanent damage . 
His ordeal was largely to be subjected to threats of violence as up to eight guards circled him during his interrogation . 
But Zaid claims he witnessed what happened to men brought from another detention facility , a barracks run by the Wolf Brigade , who were kept in the same area as Zaid until his parents paid a hefty bribe for his release . ' 
I saw men from Samarra -LRB- another insurgent stronghold -RRB- and from Medayeen . 
Some appeared to have wounds to their legs , ' he recalled . 
` There were others who could not use their spoon properly . 
They had to hold it between their palms and move their heads to the spoon . ' 
His month in the ministry terrified Zaid . 
If the police came again for him , he said , he would rather throw himself off a balcony than go back . 
Zaid is not the first detainee to accuse the police of taking bribes for the release of prisoners . 
It is a common charge , as are descriptions of prisoners being brought from other , less accountable , interrogation facilities where the worst of the violence is taking place . 
What is most important about Zaid 's testimony is that it makes clear a link exists between the Ministry of Interior and the torture being conducted out of sight at other centres . 
Iraqi and international officials named several of these centres , including al-Hadoud prison in the Kharkh district of Baghdad . 
A second torture center is said to be located in the basement of a clinic in the Shoula district , while the Wolf Brigade is accused of running its own interrogation center - said to be one of the worst - at its Nissor Square headquarters . 
Other places where abusive interrogations have been alleged include al-Muthana airbase and the old National Security headquarters . 
` Abu Ali ' , a 30-year-old Sunni scooped up in a mosque raid in central Baghdad , was taken to the latter for a week in mid-May where he says he was beaten on his feet , subjected to hanging by his arms and , when he angered his guards by refusing to confess , threatened with being sat on ` the bottle ' - being anally penetrated . 
It is not just in Baghdad . 
Credible reports exist of Arab prisoners in Kirkuk being moved to secret detention facilities in Kurdistan , while other centres are alleged in Samarra , in the Holy Cities and in Basra in the south . 
` There are places we can get to and know about , ' said one Iraqi official . 
` But there are dozens of other places we know about where there is no access at all . ' 
` It is impossible to keep track of detentions , and what is happening to people when they are taken away , ' complained one foreign official involved in trying to building Iraq 's respect for human rights . 
` On top of that we have a whole culture that is permitting torture . 
The impression is the judiciary are simply not interested in responding to the issue of human rights . 
It is depressing . ' 
But it is not simply the issue of keeping track of where detainees are being taken that is a problem . 
Accountability has also become more opaque since the formation of the Shia-dominated government of Ibrahim Jaffari with ministers and senior officials at the Ministry of the Interior refusing to meet concerned international organizations including Human Rights Watch . 
` We have been trying to break through to someone responsible to express our concerns , ' said another international official . 
` But it is impossible to meet the people we really need to see . 
What is so worrying is that allegations concerning the use of drills and irons during torture just keep coming back . 
And we have seen precisely the same evidence of torture on bodies that have turned up after they have been arrested . 
There is a dirty counter-insurgency war , led on the anti-insurgency side by groups responsible to different leaders . 
People are not appearing in court . 
Instead , what is happening to them is totally arbitrary . ' 
There is a significance to all this that goes beyond the everyday horror of today 's Iraq . 
In the absence of weapons of mass destruction , the human rights abuses of Saddam Hussein 's regime became more important as a subsidiary case for war . 
It has been a theme that has been constantly reiterated : it was horrific then , and it is better now . 
The second may still just be true . 
In many aspects there may be some improvement , but the trajectory of Iraq now on human rights is in danger of undermining that last plank of justification . 
True , there is a question of scale of the abuses . 
What is also different from Saddam 's era is that Iraq is now host to multinational troops , to huge UK and US missions , and is a substantial recipient of foreign aid , including British and EU funds . 
British and US police and military officials act as advisers to Iraq 's security forces . 
Foreign troops support Iraqi policing missions . 
What is extraordinary is that despite the increasingly widespread evidence of torture , governments have remained silent . 
It is all the more extraordinary on the British side , as embassy officials have been briefed by senior Iraqi officials over the allegations on a number of occasions and individual cases of abuse have been raised with British diplomats . 
In Iraq 's Ministry of Human Rights , close to the Communications Tower and the location of one of the secret interrogation centres , they were marking the international day for the victims of torture . 
As officials gathered for chocolate cake and cola under posters that read ` Non to torture ' , some senior officials are in no doubt that torture in their country is again getting worse . 
The deputy minister , Aida Ussayran , is a life-long human rights activist who returned from exile in Britain to take up this post . 
She concedes that abuses by Iraq 's security forces have been getting worse even as her ministry has been trying to re-educate the Iraqi police and army to respect detainee rights . 
` As you know , for a long time Iraq was a mass grave for human rights , ' she says . 
` The challenge is that many people who committed these abuses are still there and there is a culture of abuse in the security forces and police - even the army - that needs to be addressed . 
I do not have a magic solution , but what I can do is to remind people that this kind of behavior is what creates terrorists . ' 
There is a sense of frustration too in the Ministry of Human Rights , for even as the security forces rapidly increase in size , the ministry tasked with checking abuses has only 24 monitors to pursue cases , at a time when officials believe it needs hundreds to keep Iraq 's police and army effectively in check . 
If Ussayran is robust about her country 's problems with human rights abuses , others are convinced that , far from being the acts of rogue units , the abuse is being committed at the behest of the ministry itself - or at least senior officials within it . 
` There are people in the ministry who want to use these means , ' said one . 
` It is in their ideology . 
It is their strategy . 
They do not understand anything else . 
They believe that human rights and the Convention against Torture are stupid . '

2005-07-04,"Monday 4 July 2005 15.20 BST Following is an edited transcript of US President George Bush 's interview on Tonight with Trevor McDonald to be broadcast on ITV1 at 8pm today . 
SIR TREVOR MCDONALD FOR TONIGHT : Mr President , the G8 summit will be chaired by Tony Blair . 
He wants to get new international agreements on aid , on trade and on climate change . 
Now , he gave you unstinting support over the war in Iraq - can he expect the same support from you over the G8 ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : You know , Tony Blair made decisions on what he thought was best for the people of Great Britain , and I made decisions on what I thought was best for Americans . 
And I really do n't view our relationship as one of quid pro quo . 
I view our relationship as one of strong allies and friends working together for the common good . 
TONIGHT : On the question of Tony Blair , his support for you on Iraq probably damaged him politically at home . 
Supporting his proposals in Edinburgh might be one way of paying him back and making sure that he can probably repair some of that damage . 
PRESIDENT BUSH : Well , again , I really do n't view our relationship as one of , you know , we both make decisions and try to earn credit with each other on a personal basis . 
Tony Blair made decisions on what he thought was best for keeping the peace and winning the war on terror , as did I. So I go to the G8 not really trying to make him look bad or good ; but I go to the G8 with an agenda that I think is best for our country . 
TONIGHT : The subject of climate change is one of the subjects on the G8 agenda . 
Now , the majority of the world 's leading scientists now agree that climate change is a reality . 
Do you agree with their conclusion ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : I believe it is a significant , long-term issue that we 've got to deal with . 
And that 's why my government is dealing with it . 
We spent I think over $ 20 billion since I 've been the president to not only research the issue of greenhouse gases , but to develop technologies that will enable us to diversify away from fossil fuels . 
And I look forward to discussing this agenda with not only the G8 leaders , but also with the leaders of developing countries , countries like India and China . 
TONIGHT : Do you accept that climate change is man-made , sir ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : To a certain extent it is , obviously . 
I mean , if fossil fuels create greenhouse gases , we 're burning fossil fuel , as is a lot of other countries . 
You know , look , there was a debate over Kyoto , and I made the decision - as did a lot of other people in this country , by the way - that the Kyoto treaty did n't suit our needs . 
In other words , the Kyoto treaty would have wrecked our economy , if I can be blunt . 
And so my hope is - and I think the hope of Tony Blair is - to move beyond the Kyoto debate and to collaborate on new technologies that will enable the United States and other countries to diversify away from fossil fuels so that the air will be cleaner and that we have the economic and national security that comes from less dependence on foreign sources of oil ... To that end , we 're investing in a lot of hydrogen - research on hydrogen-powered automobiles . 
I believe we 'll be able to burn coal without emitting any greenhouse gases , zero emissions plant . 
And so , therefore , we 've got to spend money and share technology as to how to move forward . 
TONIGHT : But Mr President , if I may , the predictions about global warming - and I hear what you say - are very dire . 
The UK 's chief scientist says that it probably poses a bigger threat than global terrorism . 
Is n't it , therefore , irresponsible for you to say , as you 've done , that you walked away from Kyoto and you wo n't order cuts in carbon dioxide emissions because it would damage America 's economy ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : I walked away from Kyoto because it would damage America 's economy , you bet . 
It would have destroyed our economy . 
It was a lousy deal for the American economy . 
I felt there was a better way . 
And that 's why -- TONIGHT -LRB- interrupting -RRB- : But is that putting American industrial economic interests above the global interests of the environment ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : No , I think you can do both . 
See , I think you can grow your economy and at the same time do a better job of harnessing greenhouse gases . 
That 's exactly what I intend to talk to our partners about . 
I do n't think you can expect any American leader to wreck the economy , nor as an ally and a friend of America and a trading partner of America should you want us to wreck our economy . 
On the other hand , what you would want us to do is to use our investment capacity , as well as our research capacity to come up with new ways to power our economy , new ways to energise our economy . 
And that 's precisely what we 're doing , and I look forward to sharing those ideas . 
Secondly , the Kyoto treaty would n't work unless all nations were involved . 
And as you know , many of the developing nations were n't involved in Kyoto . 
So some of the discussions we 're going to have at the G8 , thanks to Tony Blair 's leadership , is to work with India and China as to how to share technology with them , so that we can all work together to clean up the environment , and at the same time have sustained economic growth . 
TONIGHT : They are expecting , many countries are expecting international legal binding agreements on cutting greenhouse gas emissions . 
Can they expect your support in doing that ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : If this looks like Kyoto , the answer is no. . 
On the other hand , if people want to come together and share technologies and develop technologies and jointly spend - and spend money on research and development , just like the United States is , to help us diversify away from fossil fuels , -LRB- I am -RRB- more than willing to discuss it . 
I know we need more nuclear power in order - nuclear power , after all , is not dependent on fossil fuels and emits no greenhouse gases . 
I believe we 're going to be able to have coal-fired plants that have zero emissions . 
We need to work on carbon sequestration technologies . 
I mean , there 's a lot we can do together and achieve the objective , which a lot of people want , which is the reduction of greenhouse gases , and at the same time , have viable economic growth . 
TONIGHT : And because , sir , America remains the biggest polluter . 
PRESIDENT BUSH : America is the largest investor in the technologies necessary to be able to say to people , ` You can grow your economy so people 's standard of living can improve , and at the same time be good stewards of the environment ' . 
TONIGHT : But pollution in this country has increased amazingly since 1992 . 
PRESIDENT BUSH : That is a totally inaccurate statement . 
TONIGHT : It 's a UN figure . 
PRESIDENT BUSH : Well , I just beg to differ with every figure you 've got . 
The environment has - the quality of the environment has improved , in spite of the fact that we 've grown our economy . 
TONIGHT : You recently helped , Mr President , to scrap the debt burden on some of Africa 's poorest countries - and you 've won some praise for that . 
But should n't a country as rich as yours be giving much more in direct aid to these poverty stricken countries of Africa ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : Well , we 've tripled the budget on direct aid to the countries in Africa since I 've been the president - tripled it . 
We have got a great trade agreement with the African nations called AGOA , the African Growth and Opportunity Act , and that is working . 
I just announced a $ 674 million food relief package . 
We 're spending $ 15 billion on HIV\/Aids . 
No , we 're leading the world when it comes to helping Africa . 
But we 've done something else that I think is smart and I think our taxpayers appreciate . 
And that is that we 're saying , ` Now , for increased aid , you , the leaders of Africa , must have transparency in your government , you must fight corruption , you must invest in the health and education of your people . ' 
In other words , we 're not going to invest in governments that are corrupt . 
TONIGHT : So this is aid with strings attached ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : No , this is aid - this is partnership . 
This is saying to nations we want to work with you as partners , partners in alleviating poverty , partners in helping fight HIV\/Aids . 
But you 've got a role to play - you , the leaders of African nations , you 've got a role to play to make good governance decisions . 
That 's what the taxpayers of my country expect . 
And I hope that 's what the taxpayers of Great Britain expect , is expect us to , when we make investments in countries , that they work . 
And they do n't work if a nation does n't invest in its people . 
TONIGHT : I hear what you say about tripling the aid to Africa , but it 's still only - it 's less than 0.2 % of gross domestic national product . 
And that is less than what the United Nations talks about , of having 0.7 % . 
Some European countries are moving towards that . 
Why ca n't America ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : You know , there 's all kinds of ways to calculate how generous we are . 
Let me just tell you this : if you take all the food aid , America is by far the most generous country . 
If you take the direct aid , we 're very generous . 
But when you add on our private contributions - see , our tax system encourages private citizens to donate to organizations that , for example , help the folks in Africa . 
And when you take the combined effort of US taxpayers ' money plus US citizens ' donations , we 're very generous . 
And we 'll do more . 
And I look forward to talking about doing more at the G8 . 
But I 've got to tell you , I 'm very proud of the generosity of the United States . 
TONIGHT : Mr President , on the question of trade , how can it be morally justified for the world 's richest country to subsidise its farmers so that they can sell their goods cheaper than farmers in the developing world , and , as a result , put those farmers in the developing world out of business ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : That 's precisely the question we 've been talking to the EU about . 
There are tremendous agricultural subsidies in the EU . 
We - TONIGHT -LRB- INTERRUPTING -RRB- : Yes , but , I put those questions to the EU , if I were talking to somebody in the EU , but - PRESIDENT BUSH : No , let me - let me finish , let me finish . 
I was about to say , we 've got agricultural subsidies , not nearly to the extent that our friends in the EU have , and therefore , we went to Doha round , WTO - Doha round of the WTO and said , ` Let 's get rid of all our subsidies together . 
Let 's join hands as wealthy industrialised nations and say to the world , we 're going to get rid of all our agricultural subsidies together . ' 
And so the position of the US government is , we 're willing to do so , and we will do so with the - with our fine friends in the European Union . 
TONIGHT : So you would if they would , because at the moment , for example - TONIGHT : - cotton farmers in this country get subsidised to the extent of $ 230 per cotton acre . 
You would get rid of those things if the EU does ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : Absolutely . 
And I think we have an obligation to work together to do that . 
And that 's why it 's very important that the Doha round of the WTO go forward . 
TONIGHT : Because if we do achieve this business of free trade , and if markets in the west are opened up to countries in Africa , say , they could be so successful , then , that they could eliminate the need for aid . 
PRESIDENT BUSH : Absolutely . 
That 's the whole reason why we 've got the African Growth and Opportunity Act . 
As a matter of fact , the benefits that have come from opening up markets - our markets to them and their markets to us - far outweigh the benefits of aid . 
TONIGHT : Mr President , if I can move on to the question of Iraq , when we last spoke before the Iraq war , I asked you about Saddam Hussein and you said this , and I quote : `` He harbors and develops weapons of mass destruction , make no mistake about it . '' 
Well , today , no WMD , the war has cost 1,700 American lives , many more Iraqi civilians killed , hundreds of billions of dollars in cost to your country . 
Can you understand why some people in your country are now beginning to wonder whether it was really worth it ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : Absolutely . 
I mean , when you turn on your TV set every day and see this incredible violence and the havoc that is wreaked as a result of these killers , I 'm sure why people are getting discouraged . 
And that 's why I spoke to the nation last night and reminded people that this is a - Iraq is a part of this global war on terror . 
And the reason why foreign fighters are flocking into Iraq is because they want to drive us out of the region . 
See , these folks represent an ideology that is based upon hate and kind of a narrow vision of mankind - women do n't have rights . 
And I believe this is an ideological movement . 
And I know that they want to use suicide bombers and assassinations and attacks on the World Trade Centre , and the attacks in Madrid , to try to shake our will and to achieve an objective , which is to topple governments . 
And the best way to defeat an ideology is with a better ideology . 
And I believe democracy is a better ideology , to provide hope for people and - but yes , it 's tough . 
But we 've done tough things before in America . 
And we 've got a great ally in Great Britain . 
But it 's not only Great Britain . 
As Gerhard Schrder said in the Oval Office , a democratic Iraq is important not only to Germany , but to Europe , and he 's right . 
Foreign fighters are traveling into Iraq to make it a front line in the war on terror . 
And I would rather defeat them there than face them in our own country . 
TONIGHT : Have you still - do you still think that you may have mismanaged , or do you think you may have mismanaged public expectations about a quick victory and a decisive ending to this war ? 
You 've talked in optimistic terms . 
But now , as you say , the carnage on the screens night after night seems - tell a different story . 
PRESIDENT BUSH : Well , certainly that 's a very powerful weapon for the terrorists , is to kill innocent men , women and children , and try to shake our will and conscience . 
And on the other hand , there is progress being made in Iraq . 
Remember , it was n't all that long ago that 8 million people went to the polls to vote . 
And you might remember the discussions prior to the vote . 
I had a lot of people saying , ` Well , they do n't know what they 're doing , the people do n't want to be free , certain people ca n't - they 're not going to - what makes you think they want democracy ? ' 
And all of a sudden , when given the chance , 8 million people voted . 
And now the political process is moving in parallel with the security process . 
And our strategy is to help the Iraqis stand up a viable government , to encourage them to get their constitution written , and to have the elections , to ratify the constitution , as well as a government under the constitution , and , at the same time , train Iraqis so they can fight . 
That 's our strategy . 
And we 're making good progress . 
TONIGHT : Is the administration at sixes and sevens about the insurgency in Iraq ? 
The vice-president said that we 're in the last throes , or seeing the last throes of the insurgency . 
Donald Rumsfeld comes up and says we could be there for five , eight , 10 , 12 years . 
Which do you believe ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : I believe that we will succeed in Iraq , because , one , the Iraqis want to live in a free society . 
TONIGHT : But how long will it take , Mr President ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : And , two , that the Iraqis want to take the fight to the enemy . 
And people want me to put a timetable on things ; that 's a huge mistake . 
Putting a timetable on this - on our stay there in Iraq simply emboldens the enemy and discourages our friends . 
And so , therefore , my answer is just , quickly as possible , and we are making progress . 
TONIGHT : Do you ever think maybe this was not such a good idea ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : No , I 'm actually confident it 's the right thing to do . 
TONIGHT : You have never had any doubts at all about it ? 
PRESIDENT BUSH : I am absolutely confident that we made the right decision . 
And not only that , I 'm absolutely confident that the actions we took in Iraq are influencing reformers and freedom lovers in the greater Middle East . 
And I believe that you 're going to see the rise of democracy in many countries in the broader Middle East , which will lay the foundation for peace .

2005-07-05,"Tuesday 5 July 2005 00.34 BST Coca-Cola has returned to Iraq after an absence of nearly four decades , triggering a cola war in a lucrative but potentially hostile market . 
Coke ended its 37-year exile last week by setting up a joint-venture bottling company to compete with Pepsi for 26 million consumers . 
The upsides for Coke include a thirst-inducing climate and burgeoning Islamic conservatism which has banned beer and other alcoholic drinks in much of the country . 
The downsides , besides Pepsi 's head start , are a raging insurgency and banditry which threaten supply routes , and a perception that Coca-Cola is linked to Israel and `` American Zionists '' . 
Coke withdrew from Iraq in 1968 when the Arab League declared a boycott because of business ties to Israel , leaving Pepsi to dominate the Middle East market for soft drinks . 
The boycott ended in 1991 , but sanctions and wars kept Coke out of Iraq . 
After a trickle of Coca-Cola imports from neighbouring countries , the company is attempting a proper comeback by launching a joint venture with a Turkish company , Efes Invest , and its Iraqi partner HMBS , which will reportedly bottle the Coke in Dubai and distribute it across Iraq . 
`` A local bottling company will employ local people to do this , '' a Coca-Cola spokesman said yesterday . 
`` This happens in most of the 200 countries in which we operate around the world , despite the perception of us as an American company . '' 
The response in Baghdad yesterday was mixed . 
One drink wholesaler , Abbas Salih , said the initiative was doomed . 
`` Coca-Cola does business with those who are shooting our brothers in Palestine , '' he said . 
`` How can we drink it ? '' 
Abu Ream , a shop owner in Baghdad , repeated a widespread conspiracy theory : `` If you hold up a Coke can to the mirror , the writing says ` No Allah ' , '' Mr Ream said . 
`` Or maybe ` No Mohammad ' . 
I ca n't remember which . '' 
But Mr Ream said since supplies became available two years ago he had sold more Coke than Pepsi . 
`` People like the taste better . 
And they like the novelty . '' 
Coca-Cola denies any political or religious bias . 
`` The myth is indeed sometimes perpetuated , but has no truth to it , '' the spokesman said . 
`` We are a local business that employs local people ... Our Palestinian bottler employs 250 Palestinians . '' 
After the 1990 invasion of Kuwait , sanctions led the Iraqi licence holder , Baghdad Soft Drinks , to replace the authentic Pepsi concentrate it had used with fakes smuggled from eastern Europe . 
Matters were not helped when Saddam Hussein 's son Uday bought 10 % of the company . 
But Baghdad Soft Drinks says Pepsi is rebuilding , with bottling operations in the capital and southern Iraq . 
In the west , Coke and Pepsi have been targeted as US symbols . 
Entrepreneurs have produced alternatives such as Mecca-Cola and Muslim Up . 
But in Iraq , hostility to the US is expressed more directly in attacks on US troops ; Sunni Arab insurgent sympathisers have no problem drinking and serving Pepsi .

2005-07-08,"The struggle against terrorism can not be won by military means The G8 must seize the opportunity to address the wider issues at the root of such atrocities Friday 8 July 2005 15.00 BST I have rarely seen the Commons so full and so silent as when it met yesterday to hear of the London bombings . 
A forum that often is raucous and rowdy was solemn and grave . 
A chamber that normally is a bear pit of partisan emotions was united in shock and sorrow . 
Even Ian Paisley made a humane plea to the press not to repeat the offence that occurred in Northern Ireland when journalists demanded comment from relatives before they were informed that their loved ones were dead . 
The immediate response to such human tragedy must be empathy with the pain of those injured and the grief of those bereaved . 
We recoil more deeply from loss of life in such an atrocity because we know the unexpected disappearance of partners , children and parents must be even harder to bear than a natural death . 
It is sudden , and therefore there is no farewell or preparation for the blow . 
Across London today there are relatives whose pain may be more acute because they never had the chance to offer or hear last words of affection . 
It is arbitrary and therefore an event that changes whole lives , which turn on the accident of momentary decisions . 
How many people this morning ask themselves how different it might have been if their partner had taken the next bus or caught an earlier tube ? 
But perhaps the loss is hardest to bear because it is so difficult to answer the question why it should have happened . 
This weekend we will salute the heroism of the generation that defended Britain in the last war . 
In advance of the commemoration there have been many stories told of the courage of those who risked their lives and sometimes lost their lives to defeat fascism . 
They provide moving , humbling examples of what the human spirit is capable , but at least the relatives of the men and women who died then knew what they were fighting for . 
What purpose is there to yesterday 's senseless murders ? 
Who could possibly imagine that they have a cause that might profit from such pointless carnage ? 
At the time of writing , no group has surfaced even to explain why they launched the assault . 
Sometime over the next few days we may be offered a website entry or a video message attempting to justify the impossible , but there is no language that can supply a rational basis for such arbitrary slaughter . 
The explanation , when it is offered , is likely to rely not on reason but on the declaration of an obsessive fundamentalist identity that leaves no room for pity for victims who do not share that identity . 
Yesterday the prime minister described the bombings as an attack on our values as a society . 
In the next few days we should remember that among those values are tolerance and mutual respect for those from different cultural and ethnic backgrounds . 
Only the day before , London was celebrating its coup in winning the Olympic Games , partly through demonstrating to the world the success of our multicultural credentials . 
Nothing would please better those who planted yesterday 's bombs than for the atrocity to breed suspicion and hostility to minorities in our own community . 
Defeating the terrorists also means defeating their poisonous belief that peoples of different faiths and ethnic origins can not coexist . 
In the absence of anyone else owning up to yesterday 's crimes , we will be subjected to a spate of articles analyzing the threat of militant Islam . 
Ironically they will fall in the same week that we recall the tenth anniversary of the massacre at Srebrenica , when the powerful nations of Europe failed to protect 8,000 Muslims from being annihilated in the worst terrorist act in Europe of the past generation . 
Osama bin Laden is no more a true representative of Islam than General Mladic , who commanded the Serbian forces , could be held up as an example of Christianity . 
After all , it is written in the Qur ` an that we were made into different peoples not that we might despise each other , but that we might understand each other . 
Bin Laden was , though , a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies . 
Throughout the 80s he was armed by the CIA and funded by the Saudis to wage jihad against the Russian occupation of Afghanistan . 
Al-Qaida , literally `` the database '' , was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians . 
Inexplicably , and with disastrous consequences , it never appears to have occurred to Washington that once Russia was out of the way , Bin Laden 's organization would turn its attention to the west . 
The danger now is that the west 's current response to the terrorist threat compounds that original error . 
So long as the struggle against terrorism is conceived as a war that can be won by military means , it is doomed to fail . 
The more the west emphasises confrontation , the more it silences moderate voices in the Muslim world who want to speak up for cooperation . 
Success will only come from isolating the terrorists and denying them support , funds and recruits , which means focusing more on our common ground with the Muslim world than on what divides us . 
The G8 summit is not the best-designed forum in which to launch such a dialogue with Muslim countries , as none of them is included in the core membership . 
Nor do any of them make up the outer circle of select emerging economies , such as China , Brazil and India , which are also invited to Gleneagles . 
We are not going to address the sense of marginalisation among Muslim countries if we do not make more of an effort to be inclusive of them in the architecture of global governance . 
But the G8 does have the opportunity in its communique today to give a forceful response to the latest terrorist attack . 
That should include a statement of their joint resolve to hunt down those who bear responsibility for yesterday 's crimes . 
But it must seize the opportunity to address the wider issues at the root of terrorism . 
In particular , it would be perverse if the focus of the G8 on making poverty history was now obscured by yesterday 's bombings . 
The breeding grounds of terrorism are to be found in the poverty of back streets , where fundamentalism offers a false , easy sense of pride and identity to young men who feel denied of any hope or any economic opportunity for themselves . 
A war on world poverty may well do more for the security of the west than a war on terror . 
And in the privacy of their extensive suites , yesterday 's atrocities should prompt heart-searching among some of those present . 
President Bush is given to justifying the invasion of Iraq on the grounds that by fighting terrorism abroad , it protects the west from having to fight terrorists at home . 
Whatever else can be said in defense of the war in Iraq today , it can not be claimed that it has protected us from terrorism on our soil . 
"
2005-07-08,"Friday 8 July 2005 15.01 BST During the last phase of the Troubles , the IRA targeted mainland Britain : it came close to blowing up Margaret Thatcher and her cabinet in Brighton . 
Some years later a missile was fired at No 10 . 
London 's financial quarter was also targeted . 
There was no secret as to the identity of the organization that carried out the hits or its demands . 
And all this happened despite the various Prevention of Terrorism Acts passed by the Commons . 
The bombers who targeted London yesterday are anonymous . 
It is assumed that those who carried out these attacks are linked to al-Qaida . 
We simply do not know . 
Al-Qaida is not the only terrorist group in existence . 
It has rivals within the Muslim diaspora . 
But it is safe to assume that the cause of these bombs is the unstinting support given by New Labor and its prime minister to the US wars in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
One of the arguments deployed by Ken Livingstone , the mayor of London , when he appealed to Tony Blair not to support the war in Iraq was prescient : `` An assault on Iraq will inflame world opinion and jeopardise security and peace everywhere . 
London , as one of the major world cities , has a great deal to lose from war and a lot to gain from peace , international cooperation and global stability . '' 
Most Londoners -LRB- as the rest of the country -RRB- were opposed to the Iraq war . 
Tragically , they have suffered the blow and paid the price for the re-election of Blair and a continuation of the war . 
Ever since 9\/11 , I have been arguing that the `` war against terror '' is immoral and counterproductive . 
It sanctions the use of state terror - bombing raids , torture , countless civilian deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq - against Islamo-anarchists whose numbers are small , but whose reach is deadly . 
The solution then , as now , is political , not military . 
The British ruling elite understood this perfectly well in the case of Ireland . 
Security measures , anti-terror laws rushed through parliament , identity cards , a curtailment of civil liberties , will not solve the problem . 
If anything , they will push young Muslims in the direction of mindless violence . 
The real solution lies in immediately ending the occupation of Iraq , Afghanistan and Palestine . 
Just because these three wars are reported sporadically and mean little to the everyday lives of most Europeans does not mean the anger and bitterness they arouse in the Muslim world and its diaspora is insignificant . 
As long as western politicians wage their wars and their colleagues in the Muslim world watch in silence , young people will be attracted to the groups who carry out random acts of revenge . 
At the beginning of the G8 , Blair suggested that `` poverty was the cause of terrorism '' . 
It is not so . 
The principal cause of this violence is the violence being inflicted on the people of the Muslim world . 
And unless this is recognized , the horrors will continue . 
Tariq Ali 's latest book is Speaking of Empire and Resistance . 
"
2005-07-11,"` We had 50 images within an hour ' Britain watched the story of the London bombings through mobile phone pictures and video clips , while America saw another 9\/11 . 
MediaGuardian reflects on a momentous day for journalism It was a new kind of story . 
Not in the sense of what happened , which was thoroughly and depressingly as anticipated , but in the way it was reported and disseminated . 
The mobile phone photographers , the text messagers and the bloggers - a new advance guard of amateur reporters had the London bomb story in the can before the news crews got anywhere near the scene . 
Emerging from inside the police cordon , ordinary tube travellers brought out dramatic footage that defined the media coverage , leading the evening TV news bulletins and staring out from the pages of the next day 's newspapers . 
Seasoned news executives talk of a `` tipping point '' , a democratisation of the news process , the true birth of the `` citizen reporter '' . 
The public assuming control of the newsgathering process to a hitherto unimagined degree . 
But what about authenticity ? 
How do recipients of unsolicited video clips and grainy camera phone pictures know where they have come from ? 
Who will be first to be hoaxed ? 
And what about issues of privacy ? 
Imagine , for example , being one of those injured in the blast , when before tending to your wounds , a fellow passenger looms over your body to snap a close-up picture with his or her mobile phone . 
Here , MediaGuardian writers assess the implications of this new shift in the balance of media power . 
Helen Boaden , the BBC 's director of news , described it as a `` new world '' and a `` gear change '' . 
Minutes after the bombings occurred in London last Thursday , newsrooms around the capital were being deluged with pictures and video clips sent directly from the scene . 
The long-predicted democratisation of the media had become a reality , as ordinary members of the public turned photographers and reporters . 
Claustrophobic videos shot in smoke-filled , bombed-out London underground carriages , photographs of the blasted No 30 bus and horrific scenes of body-strewn roads were among the most powerful images to emerge . 
All were shot by members of the public , and some of them became the iconic pictures of the day . 
`` Within minutes of the first blast we had received images from the public , '' says Boaden . 
`` We had 50 images within an hour . 
Now there are thousands . 
We had a gallery of still photographs from the public online , and they were incredibly powerful . '' 
The BBC 's Ten O'Clock News used two mobile phone sequences shot by members of the public , and the main picture used on its online news service on Thursday was taken by a passer-by . 
`` People are very media-savvy . 
We saw the use of what we call ` user-generated material ' in the tsunami and at the floods in Boscastle . 
But as people get used to creating pictures and videos on their phones in normal life , they increasingly think of sending them to us when major incidents occur . '' 
Boaden believes the growing interaction between the public and broadcasters is changing the media for the better . 
`` It shows there is a terrific level of trust between the audience and us , creating a more intimate relationship than in the past . 
It shows a new closeness forming between BBC news and the public . 
Each big story that happens confirms that . '' 
More than 300 emails containing an average of three images and about 30 video clips were sent to the yourpics@bbc.co.uk address on Thursday . 
The iconic picture of the devastated bus at Tavistock Square was sent to the website within 45 minutes of the bombing and was subsequently used on the front pages of the Guardian and the Daily Mail on Friday . 
Some mobile phone video footage was on air just 20 minutes after being received by rolling news channels . 
Ben Rayner , the editor of the ITV News channel , says ITN was sent more than a dozen video clips from mobile phones on Thursday , and the clips - some so graphic as to render them unusable - played an important role in getting across to viewers the nature of the story . 
`` It 's the way forward for instant newsgathering , especially when it involves an attack on the public , '' he believes . 
Mobile phone video clips and stills were posted on to internet sites alongside first-hand accounts of people 's experiences , building up a vast catalogue of DIY coverage more comprehensive and wide-ranging than anything available through the mainstream media . 
John Ryley , the executive editor of Sky News , says video from the bombed tube between King 's Cross and Russell Square stations was received at 12.40 pm and was on air by 1pm . 
`` It raises questions for the authorities but these devices allow a democratisation of news . 
News crews usually get there just after the event , but these pictures show us the event as it happens , `` says Ryley . 
One senior BBC broadcaster sums up the effect of mobile phone videos being used on the corporation 's news : `` I sat down and watched the Ten O'Clock News last night and thought ` this is a media turning point ' . 
It was revolutionary . '' 
Just as the internet was said to have arrived as a major news source during the events of 9\/11 , blogging may come to be seen as the new news essential as of last week - from Wednesday , when email inboxes and irreverent blogs burst with pictures mocking the French Olympic bid , to 24 hours later when the internet mood had utterly changed . 
And with traditional news outlets initially struggling to make sense of conflicting reports in the minutes and hours that followed the four blasts , many people turned to the internet . 
It was not the first time that news websites have seen a huge hike in traffic due to a big story , but this time - partly because it took place during office hours and partly because blogs have now become a familiar part of online life - many people also then turned to less formal sites . 
Anthony Barnett , editor-in-chief at global politics and culture site OpenDemocracy , which runs its own blog , has also noted the change . 
`` The blog mechanism has come in since 9\/11 and has created quite a natural form , '' he says . 
For Open Democray and others , including some traditional media owners such as the Guardian and the New York Times , the blog provides an increasingly crucial addition to their core online services . 
LiveJournal , a community site , attracted hundreds of posts during the day . 
Most of them provided practical information , such as transport updates , pleas for missing persons and links to the latest news updates from around the world . 
`` The community has worked best because it was more timely than conventional news media - but now they 're very much on the scene , providing a full news and analysis service , and London is trying to get back to normal , '' the site 's administrator wrote last Friday morning . 
With every blog posting on the subject and linking to other postings and news stories , it is possible to track the progress of information and conjecture around the web . 
Technorati , a website that tracks around 12.2 million blogs , reported a 30 % increase in blogging activity on Thursday , when nine of the top 10 searches were about the bombings . 
And while the benefits of the internet in times of crisis were apparent - as a place to find practical information fast , as a giant message board to search for missing people , find communal comfort and debate the issues - last week also highlighted its downside . 
On some blogs , and certainly on many message boards , rational debate descended into the raving and the mawkish . 
And even the plain baffling - witness one US contributor who wrote : `` I 'm probably only proving that I 'm a total Star Wars wonk , but I thought the last page of the novelisation of Revenge of the Sith seemed fitting here ... '' The attack was the first big breaking news story since the BBC published its new editorial guidelines that made explicit the new `` accuracy is more important than speed '' creed . 
With so many people turning to breaking news during the day , whether on the digital rolling news channels or the main networks that had ripped up their schedules , clear differences in tone , style and content were laid bare to a mass audience for the first time . 
BBC News 24 was noticeably more cautious in its coverage than Sky News , which rushed to get as much information - speculation or fact - on air . 
ITV , meanwhile , sat somewhere between the two . 
In truth , the differences have been evident for some time , since the Lambert report into BBC News 24 required it to become more distinctive . 
But with a far bigger audience than the usual news junkie crowd , the differences hit home to many viewers for the first time . 
`` We get confirmed facts on air immediately but it 's true we 're cautious about some wire copy or internet-type rumors that we ca n't substantiate ourselves , '' says Roger Mosey , head of television news at the BBC . 
`` At times on Thursday we were getting ` eyewitness accounts ' saying completely contradictory things that could n't possibly all be true . '' 
In the two hours that followed the first blast , there was so much conjec ture flying around that the rolling news channels had to be very much on their guard . 
There are even those who believe the `` power surge disruption '' explanation was a deliberate piece of disinformation disseminated by the authorities to prevent panic . 
Mosey says that the BBC would only `` put on screen what we know is right - reports from our own correspondents , the official emergency service figures and information from members of the public that we 've checked out '' . 
This `` safety first '' attitude was also in evidence on radio : `` We now have a very cautious approach to this . 
We try to get it right even if it sacrifices being first . 
We are seeking to ensure that our information is very strongly sourced before going with something like a casualty figure , '' says Stephen Mitchell , BBC head of radio news . 
Nick Pollard , head of Sky News , makes a subtle distinction , saying viewers are now in tune with the rhythms of rolling news and expect a more complete picture to build up throughout the day . 
`` We take very seriously our reputation as the place to turn to when there 's big breaking news . 
It 's what we 're there for , '' says Pollard . 
`` We tell viewers what we can see , what we know and what we do n't know . '' 
For today 's news-savvy audiences , it was important that Sky got the news out quickly on a big developing story , he says , provided that they were told where the information came from : `` We scrupulously try to tell people our source - that 's something we 've learned over the past three to four years . '' 
Apart from the proliferation of user-generated content , the coverage was notable for its restraint . 
`` It 's a very fine line . 
I always maintained the point of view that in such a terrible incident we should show what we need to show and no more , '' says David Mannion , editor-in-chief of ITV News . 
Mannion believes that the authorities appeared to be over-cautious in updating the casualty figures - with the result that foreign news wires and broadcasters were getting more up-to-date information from their own government sources . 
`` I think it was extraordinary to some degree . 
It seems to me that the Home Office and the Met adopted a policy of not adding to the death toll until they had informed relatives , '' he says , adding that it led to a situation where the people of Australia were better informed than Londoners . 
`` That is ridiculous . 
We 're all grown ups and I think it 's treating the public with a degree of disrespect to hide the truth . '' 
`` Many of us felt the angel of death brush past us yesterday morning . '' 
Suddenly even the agony aunt was a frontline reporter . 
Last Thursday , everyone was a potential eyewitness and the Sun 's Deidre Sanders , who survived the Asian tsunami , found herself at King 's Cross just after 9am , face-to-face with survivors of the underground blast . 
She described in spare , moving prose `` the huddle of shaken men and women , with red-rimmed eyes , their faces black with soot '' . 
Flick forward a few pages and the paper 's TV critic and `` Aldgate resident '' Ally Ross was shocked to see his own flat flashed up on a television news report . 
The view from his living room window was unsettling : `` Two policemen , armed with machine guns , are standing outside our packed local fun pub , '' he observed . 
Some of the accounts were almost too grim to read . 
The Daily Mail reported eyewitness Carol Miller 's description of the carnage at Edgware Road : `` I saw an old lady who was ripped to pieces , lying between the two trains , '' she said . 
The Mail reporter added : `` The force of the blast tore bodies apart and amputations were carried out at the scene . '' 
If disasters are best told in pictures , sometimes words bring home the full horror because they confront you with your own imagination . 
Among the commentators there was a sharp divide between those prepared to point the finger of blame at the prime minister and the Iraq war , and others who felt it was both inappropriate , with the death toll still mounting , and wrong . 
In her eerily prescient blog on Thursday afternoon , the Mail 's Melanie Phillips warned of `` something horrible and warped ... lurking just below the surface '' . 
She was not referring to George Galloway , rather to belief that the Iraq war `` has created more not less terror and that the British would not have been a target at all had we distanced ourselves from the US '' . 
The columnist continued : `` I expect to see mainstream writers saying as much over the next few days . '' 
In the event Phillips did not have to wait that long . 
In the Daily Mirror , Kevin Maguire , risking the ire of many of the tabloid 's readers who thoroughly disliked former editor Piers Morgan 's anti-war stance , asked : `` Was it because of the war in Iraq ? 
The answers are likely to make uncomfortable reading for Tony Blair ... Responsibility lies firmly with the butchers . 
However , when the inquest starts , the Iraq war will also be in the dock . '' 
Shoulder to shoulder with Maguire was the former Daily Telegraph and London Evening Standard editor - and military historian - Sir Max Hastings , who wrote : `` We must acknowledge that , by supporting President Bush 's extravagances in his ill-named War on Terror and ill-justified invasion of Iraq , Blair has ensured that we are in the front line beside the US whether we like it or not . '' 
Thursday 's events made for some strange bedfellows : the Respect MP George Galloway - branded `` vile '' and `` a traitor '' in the Sun - said much the same thing in the House of Commons . 
In the Guardian , meanwhile , Robin Cook - an outspoken critic of the Iraq war - urged bridge-building with the moderate Muslim world . 
`` The danger now is that the west 's current response to the terrorist threat compounds the original error , '' he wrote . 
`` So long as the struggle against terrorism is conceived as a war that can be won by military means , it is doomed to fail . '' 
Cook is no doubt one of the `` many supple self-deluding figures '' referred to in the Telegraph by Mark Steyn : business as usual by the governing class in the face of terrorism is `` not a stiff upper lip , but a death wish '' , he argued . 
`` This is the beginning of a long existential struggle for Britain and the West . '' 
Only commentators can afford to be so certain . 
It was a day in which the number of people visiting news websites soared . 
As office workers scrambled to find out the latest information , the BBC , Sky News and the Guardian websites reported significantly increased traffic . 
BBC News accounted for 28.6 % of all news page impressions in Britain on Thursday . 
Sky News was ranked third , with 3.8 % , and Guardian Unlimited fifth with 2.4 % . 
The Sun was the eighth most popular news destination , with a 1.4 % share , narrowly behind CNN.com . 
Guardian Unlimited reported that 1.3 million people accessed nearly 8m pages , the most on any one day since the website was launched . 
More than 500,000 of those users came from the US , while Madrid , scene of the train bombings which killed 191 people in March 2004 , accounted for more visits than any other city apart from London . 
The US accounted for the highest number of users , with 518,524 . 
The UK came next with 392,029 , and Canada third with 57,594 . 
Spain accounted for the fourth largest number of visitors , with 35,636 . 
The busiest period was between 1pm and 2pm : 770,000 pages were viewed on Guardian Unlimited , the equivalent of 213 pages a second . 
On a typical day , Guardian Unlimited has 3.5m-4m full-page views . 
News websites accounted for 5.6 % of all online traffic on Thursday , up nearly 50 % on the previous day . 
Sky News ' website rose more than 300 places in the overall web rankings to become the 62nd most visited website . 
Ratings for the TV news channels were predictably high . 
On Thursday , Sky News recorded a 4.21 % share of viewing , with BBC News 24 on 2.1 % and the ITV News Channel on 0.6 % . 
All three news channels were simulcast on terrestrial networks for much of the day : ITV1 was first to switch , taking a rolling service from the ITV News Channel at 10.12 am , which continued uninterrupted until 7pm . 
BBC1 followed suit later , while Five took a feed from Sky News , which was also being simulcasted by Fox News in the US . 
ITV seemed keen to re-establish its public service principles , breaking off only for episodes of Emmerdale and The Bill before returning with a two-hour news special fronted by Trevor McDonald from 9pm . 
Despite ITV 's mammoth coverage , viewers turned to the BBC in greater numbers . 
BBC1 's early evening news more than doubled its audience : nearly 7 million viewers watched the specially extended bulletin at 6pm , more than twice the 3.3 million who tuned in at the same time the previous Thursday night . 
At the same time , 4.4 million were watching ITV 's news coverage . 
There are few occasions where public relations are as important as in the immediate aftermath of a large scale terrorist attack and the accompanying risk of widespread panic . 
The Metropolitan Police 's PR department , alongside those of the other emergency services and local government , had long rehearsed for yesterday 's events and , indeed , far worse scenarios . 
`` The eyes of the world are on you at times like this , '' says the Met 's PR chief Dick Fedorcio . 
`` Thursday 's attacks began in the City of London police force area , and early on they asked us to take over the media side for them . 
Before too long we were dealing with all four attacks . 
I heard the bus blowing up as I walked into the press bureau in Scotland Yard and by then we had already started putting our plan into action . 
`` We took the view very early on that we would need access to a large venue . 
Through government support we quickly got access to the QE2 conference center which we used for the media . 
Again , we had planned for that . '' 
The Met 's deputy assistant commissioner Brian Paddick and the disaster-hardened deputy chief constable of British Transport Police , Andy Trotter , who handled the Paddington rail disaster for the Met , fronted the press conference . 
`` We need to find a senior police figure who is not directly involved in running the operation as we must have access to them round the clock due to the media demands , '' Fedorcio explains . 
`` In a terrorist situation the Met takes the lead over the other emergency services . 
Since September 11 a whole new series of structures were put in place to manage pan-London incidents under the heading London Resilience . 
Our initial objectives are : to convey that we are responding , to demonstrate that we are in control , and to reassure people as best and as early as we can . 
We also need to be as accurate as possible and not to find ourselves in a position of saying things that turn out to be untrue . '' 
Nowhere is that more important or sensitive than when it comes to numbers of casualties . 
Some media executives have expressed frustration at a perceived lack of information in this area : the ITV News editor-in-chief , David Mannion , said he had been called by a Home Office press officer demanding that a newsflash saying that at least 20 people had died be taken down . 
`` I said we would n't take it down , because we 'd got the figure from an authoritative government source , '' he said . 
`` Numbers are very difficult to manage , '' admits Fedorcio . 
`` In the Paddington rail crash there was a carriage we were n't able to get into for several days , but everyone believed a lot of people had got into it . 
In the event , it turned out there were hardly any bodies in there . 
When we have a complete body we will count that , but not before . 
We 've had to be very careful with the bus and the train at Russell Square because we wo n't have a final figure until we have all the bodies out . '' 
The bombings were front-page news all over the US print media . 
Editors were quick to stress its context in a war on terror that began for Americans with the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 . 
Memories of September 11 2001 flooded back : `` The slow realisation of the magnitude of that crime , the nagging worry that we had not seen the end of it ... '' noted an editorial in the New York Times . 
The New York Post , Rupert Murdoch 's bombastic tabloid , devoted its first 15 pages to graphic photographs of damage and dazed and bloodied survivors , while reports on the `` Massacre by Savages '' stressed Anglo-American unity . 
Noting the `` painful memories of 9\/11 '' , the Post contrasted Tony Blair 's `` steadfast behavior '' with the `` surprisingly unfocused '' George Bush , and emphasised that the London attacks were another front in the `` war on terror '' being waged in places such as Iraq . 
`` For Britain , it 's 7\/7 , '' said the Los Angeles Times , stressing the vulnerability of cities in open societies to terrorist attacks . 
Public transit systems , said the paper , are especially at risk , yet the Bush administration 's efforts to boost security were especially meager . 
The theme of continued threat at home was taken up by USA Today , America 's only national newspaper . 
`` What 's being done to prevent an attack on my train , or bus , or subway ? '' 
asked an editorial , before concluding , `` the stark reality is , not much '' . 
Americans , said USA Today , deserved better security . 
But whereas the US press reaction to 9\/11 sometimes degenerated into xenophobia , the response to 7\/7 was more tempered . 
In contrast , the TV networks , notoriously averse to covering news from abroad , tended to emphasise local angles . 
Which mostly meant wondering how safe Americans ' mass transit was . 
`` The pace and tone of American TV news , '' noted a commentator in the LA Times , `` have a way of stoking vague fears . '' 
For real news , it was best to turn to the BBC where the tone of coverage could best be described as `` adult '' . 
Like the other US newspapers , the Washington Post pointed out how new technologies shaped public perception of the London bombings . 
Americans felt an especial immediacy to events in London when blurry images of footage from the King 's Cross blast aired on their television screens . 
As USA Today noted , paraphrasing the French response to 9\/11 , today `` We are all Britons '' .

2005-07-11,"Of course those who backed the Iraq war refute any link with the London bombs - they are in the deepest denial Monday 11 July 2005 00.03 BST Shortly after September 11 2001 , when the slightest mention of a link between US foreign policy and the terrorist attacks brought accusations of heartless heresy , the then US national security adviser , Condoleezza Rice got to work . 
Between public displays of grief and solemnity she managed to round up the senior staff of the National Security Council and ask them to think seriously about `` how do you capitalize on these opportunities '' to fundamentally change American doctrine and the shape of the world . 
In an interview with the New Yorker six months later , she said the US no longer had a problem defining its post-cold war role . 
`` I think September 11 was one of those great earthquakes that clarify and sharpen . 
Events are in much sharper relief . '' 
For those interested in keeping the earth intact in its present shape so that we might one day live on it peacefully , the bombings of July 7 provide no such `` opportunities '' . 
They do not `` clarify '' or `` sharpen '' but muddy and bloody already murky waters . 
As the identities of the missing emerge , we move from a statistical body count to the tragedy of human loss - brothers , mothers , lovers and daughters cruelly blown away as they headed to work . 
The space to mourn these losses must be respected . 
The demand that we abandon rational thought , contextual analysis and critical appraisal of why this happened and what we can do to limit the chances that it will happen again , should not . 
To explain is not to excuse ; to criticise is not to capitulate . 
We know what took place . 
A group of people , with no regard for law , order or our way of life , came to our city and trashed it . 
With scant regard for human life or political consequences , employing violence as their sole instrument of persuasion , they slaughtered innocent people indiscriminately . 
They left us feeling unified in our pain and resolute in our convictions , effectively creating a community where one previously did not exist . 
With the killers probably still at large there is no civil liberty so vital that some would not surrender it in pursuit of them and no punishment too harsh that some might not sanction if we found them . 
The trouble is there is nothing in the last paragraph that could not just as easily be said from Falluja as it could from London . 
The two should not be equated - with over 1,000 people killed or injured , half its housing wrecked and almost every school and mosque damaged or flattened , what Falluja went through at the hands of the US military , with British support , was more deadly . 
But they can and should be compared . 
We do not have a monopoly on pain , suffering , rage or resilience . 
Our blood is no redder , our backbones are no stiffer , nor our tear ducts more productive than the people in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Those whose imagination could not stretch to empathise with the misery we have caused in the Gulf now have something closer to home to identify with . 
`` Collateral damage '' always has a human face : its relatives grieve ; its communities have memory and demand action . 
These basic humanistic precepts are the principle casualties of fundamentalism , whether it is wedded to Muhammad or the market . 
They were clearly absent from the minds of those who bombed London last week . 
They are no less absent from the minds of those who have pursued the war on terror for the past four years . 
Tony Blair is not responsible for the more than 50 dead and 700 injured on Thursday . 
In all likelihood , `` jihadists '' are . 
But he is partly responsible for the 100,000 people who have been killed in Iraq . 
And even at this early stage there is a far clearer logic linking these two events than there ever was tying Saddam Hussein to either 9\/11 or weapons of mass destruction . 
It is no mystery why those who have backed the war in Iraq would refute this connection . 
With each and every setback , from the lack of UN endorsement right through to the continuing strength of the insurgency , they go ever deeper into denial . 
Their sophistry has now mutated into a form of political autism - their ability to engage with the world around them has been severely impaired by their adherence to a flawed and fatal project . 
To say that terrorists would have targeted us even if we had n't gone into Iraq is a bit like a smoker justifying their habit by saying , `` I could get run over crossing the street tomorrow . '' 
True , but the certain health risks of cigarettes are more akin to playing chicken on a four-lane highway . 
They have the effect of bringing that fatal , fateful day much closer than it might otherwise be . 
Similarly , invading Iraq clearly made us a target . 
Did Downing Street really think it could declare a war on terror and that terror would not fight back ? 
That , in itself , is not a reason to withdraw troops if having them there is the right thing to do . 
But since it is n't and never was , it provides a compelling reason to change course before more people are killed here or there . 
So the prime minister got it partly right on Saturday when he said : `` I think this type of terrorism has very deep roots . 
As well as dealing with the consequences of this - trying to protect ourselves as much as any civil society can - you have to try to pull it up by its roots . '' 
What he would not acknowledge is that his alliance with President George Bush has been sowing the seeds and fertilising the soil in the Gulf , for yet more to grow . 
The invasion and occupation of Iraq - illegal , immoral and inept - provided the Arab world with one more legitimate grievance . 
Bush laid down the gauntlet : you 're either with us or with the terrorists . 
A small minority of young Muslims looked at the values displayed in Abu Ghraib , Guantnamo Bay and Camp Bread Basket - and made their choice . 
The war helped transform Iraq from a vicious , secular dictatorship with no links to international terrorism into a magnet and training ground for those determined to commit terrorist atrocities . 
Meanwhile , it diverted our attention and resources from the very people we should have been fighting - al-Qaida . 
As early as February 2003 the joint intelligence committee reported that al-Qaida and associated groups continued to represent `` by far the greatest terrorist threat to western interests , and that that threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq '' . 
At the World Economic Forum last year , Gareth Evans , the former Australian foreign minister and head of the International Crisis Group thinktank , said : `` The net result of the war on terror is more war and more terror . 
Look at Iraq : the least plausible reason for going to war - terrorism - has been its most harrowing consequence . '' 
None of that justifies what the bombers did . 
But it does help explain how we got where we are and what we need to do to move to a safer place . 
If Blair did n't know the invasion would make us more vulnerable , he is negligent ; if he did , then he should take responsibility for his part in this . 
That does not mean we deserved what was coming . 
It means we deserve a lot better .

2005-07-13,"On Monday , Marie Fatayi-Williams stood near Tavistock Square , where her son Anthony is feared to have been killed in last week 's bus bombing , and delivered a lament of extraordinary power for her lost son . 
Tim Collins , the British army colonel who himself gave a historic speech on the eve of the Iraq war , says such genuine emotion is rarely forgotten Caught in the spotlight of history , set on the stage of a very public event , Marie Fatayi-Williams , the mother of Anthony Fatayi-Williams , 26 and missing since Thursday , appeals for news of her son . 
Her words are a mixture of stirring rhetoric , heartfelt appeal and a stateswoman-like vision , and so speak on many levels to the nation and the world . 
Her appeal is a simple one - where is my son ? 
If he has been killed , then why ? 
Marie has found herself , as I did on the eve of the invasion of Iraq , an unwitting voice , speaking amid momentous events . 
Her appeal , delivered on Monday not far from Tavistock Square , where she fears her son died in the bomb attack on the number 30 bus , gives a verbal form to the whirlpool of emotions that have engulfed society as the result of last week 's bombings . 
I suspect Marie , like myself , had no idea that her words would find such wide recognition , have fed such an acute hunger for explanation , have slaked such a thirst for expression of the sheer horror of Thursday 's events . 
This kind of speech is normally the preserve of the great orators , statesmen and playwrights , of Shakespeare , Churchill or Lincoln . 
It is often a single speech , a soliloquy or address from the steps of the gallows , that explains , inspires , exhorts and challenges . 
But always such addresses are crafted for effect and consciously intended to sway and influence , and often , as in the case of Shakespeare 's Henry V , they are set in the mouth of a long dead hero or delivered by wordsmiths who are masters of their craft . 
It is rare in history that such oratory is the genuine article , springing from the heart and bursting forth to an unwitting audience . 
In Marie 's case , her speech gains its power as a vehicle of grief and loss , and of the angst of a mother who yearns for her beloved son . 
In my case it was the opposite emotion from which I drew inspiration - an appeal to understand , to empathise , to give courage and purpose . 
I was motivated by a need to warn and teach as well as to encourage . 
Marie 's motivation is a reflection on loss and that most powerful of all emotions , a mother 's love . 
The form the address takes is as poignant as the language used . 
There is an initial explanation of the extraordinary circumstances of the loss , a cri de coeur for the innocent blood lost , a rejection of the act by its comparison to the great liberators , and the assertion that her loss is all our loss in the family of humanity . 
It ends with her personal grief for her flesh and blood , her hopes and pride . 
The language echoes verses of the Bible as well as from the Koran . 
It has raw passion as well as heart-rending pathos . 
With only a photograph of her son and a sheet of paper as a prompt , Marie 's words burst out with as much emotion as anger . 
Her speech stands in stark contrast to the pronouncements of politicians , prepared by aides and delivered from copious notes . 
It is indeed the raw originality and authentic angst that give the delivery such impact , the plea such effect . 
No knighted veteran of the Royal Shakespeare Company could deliver such an address without hours or even days of rehearsal . 
I know from my own experience that only momentous events can provoke such a moment , only raw emotion can inspire such a spontaneous plea . 
I am often asked how long it took me to write my speech , delivered to my regiment , the Royal Irish , on the eve of the invasion of Iraq on March 19 2003 at Fort Blair Mayne camp in the Kuwaiti desert . 
My answer is simple - not one moment . 
There was no plan ; I spoke without notes . 
For me there was only the looming spectre of actual warfare and the certainty of loss and killing , and I was speaking to myself as well as to my men . 
I suspect for Marie there was only the yawning black void of loss , the cavern left behind in her life caused by the loss of a son who can never be replaced . 
What , then , can we take from this ? 
Marie 's appeal is important as it is momentous . 
Her words are as free from hatred as they are free from self-interest ; it is clear that no man can give her her heart 's desire - her son . 
I was also struck by the quiet dignity of her words , the clarity of her view and the weight of her convictions . 
She does not condemn , she appeals ; her words act as an indictment of all war and violence , not just acts of terror but also the unnecessary aggression of nation states . 
Her message is simple : here is a human who only wanted to give , to succeed and to make his mother proud . 
Where is the victory in his death ? 
Where is the progress in his destruction ? 
In her own words : `` What inspiration can senseless slaughter provide ? '' 
I am certain that Marie 's appeal will go down as one of the great speeches of our new century . 
It will give comfort to the families and friends of the dead and injured , both of this act and no doubt , regrettably , of events still to come . 
It should act as a caution to statesmen and leaders , a focus for public grief and , ultimately , as a challenge to , as well as a condemnation of , the perpetrators . 
Marie is already an icon of the loss of Thursday July 7 . 
Having traveled from Africa to find a better life , Anthony Fatayi-Williams carried the hopes and pride of his family . 
Now , as his mother has traveled to London , arguably one of the most cosmopolitan and integrated cities in the world , and standing nearby a wrecked icon of that city , a red double-decker bus , she has made an appeal which is as haunting as it is relevant , as poignant as it is appealing . 
It is a fact that such oratory as both Marie and I produced is born of momentous events , and inspired by hope and fears in equal measure . 
But Marie 's appeal is also important on another level . 
I have long urged soldiers in conflict zones to keep communicating with the population in order to be seen as people - it is easier to kill uniforms than it is to kill people . 
On July 7 the suicide bombers attacked icons of a society that they hated more than they loved life , the red London bus and the tube . 
Marie 's speech has stressed the real victims ' identities . 
They are all of us . 
`` This is Anthony , Anthony Fatayi - Williams , 26 years old , he 's missing and we fear that he was in the bus explosion ... on Thursday . 
We do n't know . 
We do know from the witnesses that he left the Northern line in Euston . 
We know he made a call to his office at Amec at 9.41 from the NW1 area to say he could not make -LRB- it -RRB- by the tube but he would find alternative means to work . 
Since then he has not made any contact with any single person . 
Now New York , now Madrid , now London . 
There has been widespread slaughter of innocent people . 
There have been streams of tears , innocent tears . 
There have been rivers of blood , innocent blood . 
Death in the morning , people going to find their livelihood , death in the noontime on the highways and streets . 
They are not warriors . 
Which cause has been served ? 
Certainly not the cause of God , not the cause of Allah because God Almighty only gives life and is full of mercy . 
Anyone who has been misled , or is being misled to believe that by killing innocent people he or she is serving God should think again because it 's not true . 
Terrorism is not the way , terrorism is not the way . 
It does n't beget peace . 
We ca n't deliver peace by terrorism , never can we deliver peace by killing people . 
Throughout history , those people who have changed the world have done so without violence , they have -LRB- won -RRB- people to their cause through peaceful protest . 
Nelson Mandela , Martin Luther King , Mahatma Gandhi , their discipline , their self-sacrifice , their conviction made people turn towards them , to follow them . 
What inspiration can senseless slaughter provide ? 
Death and destruction of young people in their prime as well as old and helpless can never be the foundations for building society . 
My son Anthony is my first son , my only son , the head of my family . 
In African society , we hold on to sons . 
He has dreams and hopes and I , his mother , must fight to protect them . 
This is now the fifth day , five days on , and we are waiting to know what happened to him and I , his mother , I need to know what happened to Anthony . 
His young sisters need to know what happened , his uncles and aunties need to know what happened to Anthony , his father needs to know what happened to Anthony . 
Millions of my friends back home in Nigeria need to know what happened to Anthony . 
His friends surrounding me here , who have put this together , need to know what has happened to Anthony . 
I need to know , I want to protect him . 
I 'm his mother , I will fight till I die to protect him . 
To protect his values and to protect his memory . 
Innocent blood will always cry to God Almighty for reparation . 
How much blood must be spilled ? 
How many tears shall we cry ? 
How many mothers ' hearts must be maimed ? 
My heart is maimed . 
I pray I will see my son , Anthony . 
I need to know , Anthony needs to know , Anthony needs to know , so do many others unaccounted for innocent victims , they need to know . 
It 's time to stop and think . 
We can not live in fear because we are surrounded by hatred . 
Look around us today . 
Anthony is a Nigerian , born in London , worked in London , he is a world citizen . 
Here today we have Christians , Muslims , Jews , Sikhs , Hindus , all of us united in love for Anthony . 
Hatred begets only hatred . 
It is time to stop this vicious cycle of killing . 
We must all stand together , for our common humanity . 
I need to know what happened to my Anthony . 
He 's the love of my life . 
My first son , my first son , 26 . 
He tells me one day , `` Mummy , I do n't want to die , I do n't want to die . 
I want to live , I want to take care of you , I will do great things for you , I will look after you , you will see what I will achieve for you . 
I will make you happy . ' 
And he was making me happy . 
I am proud of him , I am still very proud of him but I need to now where he is , I need to know what happened to him . 
I grieve , I am sad , I am distraught , I am destroyed . 
He did n't do anything to anybody , he loved everybody so much . 
If what I hear is true , even when he came out of the underground he was directing people to take buses , to be sure that they were OK . 
Then he called his office at the same time to tell them he was running late . 
He was a multi-purpose person , trying to save people , trying to call his office , trying to meet his appointments . 
What did he then do to deserve this . 
Where is he , someone tell me , where is he ? ''

2005-07-14,"Thursday 14 July 2005 11.13 BST Terror came to the doorstep of King 's College London last week - one variant of modern warfare that its department of war studies has been researching and teaching about for more than three decades . 
For many of those struggling to understand the conflicts that are rocking the world , one path has been to the Strand where the department has offices that look like a bunker below street level , under the command of Sir Lawrence Freedman , official historian of the Falklands campaign . 
Its postgraduate students have been drawn from far and wide . 
Now King 's is taking its war degree to the world , launching an e-learning masters , War in the Modern World , for which , from September , it hopes to have 70 students signed up around the globe . 
This expeditionary move has been more than three years in the planning and involved writing a completely new degree , suited to the internet , says Anne-Lucie Norton , director of the e-learning program . 
The possibilities for the use of pictures , maps and video material are obvious - and using the net students will role-play the Cuban missile crisis . 
-LRB- They came very close to nuclear war in the pilot earlier this year , apparently . -RRB- 
There is archive footage of Kennedy 's `` Ich bin ein Berliner '' speech from the height of the cold war , for instance , as well as of more recent wars . 
But Ms Norton points out that the academic rigor of the degree , its entry standards and the assessment by essays are all pretty traditional . 
The point of e-learning is not the technology : `` It 's the learning , stupid , '' she says . 
There have been academic casualties in previous e-learning campaigns , including Fathom , an e-learning portal created by the London School of Economics and Columbia University in the US . 
The most spectacular defeat was perhaps UKeU , the British e-university , which spent # 50m of taxpayers ' money to recruit 900 students and still could not get its technology to work before the funding council closed it down . 
The war studies e-degree was originally going to be delivered by UKeU and that debacle delayed the King 's launch by about a year , Ms Norton reckons , but she is confident the ground for this new learning exercise has been well reconnoitred , the academic ammunition is tried and tested and , above all , that the mission is clear to go . 
Core modules cover contemporary warfare from 1945 to the present day , including a unit on the `` war on terror '' and its prospects . 
A web-CT e-learning platform links students to tutors and the King 's College library - and to each other in chatrooms designed to foster an online community of interest and to stimulate discussion . 
Some of the discussion promises to be passionate - Israel and Palestine and the Iraq wars , for instance . 
More than 600 people have registered an interest in the e-learning degree over the past couple of years as it has been prepared , and there is an established international audience for King 's war studies degrees among people working in the government and non-governmental organizations as well as the services and the defense industries . 
But the college now has to convert that interest into paying customers - who would have to part with # 12,000 for the MA taken part-time over three years and # 10,500 for a diploma . 
Not at all , they 're changing lives , says @NUS_Liam -LRB- who knew he used to be a scout ? -RRB-

2005-07-14,"Thursday 14 July 2005 00.03 BST In the West Bank and Gaza , portraits of dead suicide bombers and graffiti extolling their deeds are plastered all over walls . 
Videos of their last interviews are on sale on street stalls . 
Their funerals are occasions for mass mourning . 
That celebrity factor helps in the recruitment of suicide bombers , young men and women brought up in the occupied territories . 
Anne Marie Oliver , an American academic who has spent years studying the phenomenon in the West Bank and Gaza , believes the `` star factor '' and the acquiring of glory could also have motivated the Yorkshire bombers . 
They will not have posters up in Britain or mass mourning , but they will attain glory on internet sites across the Muslim world , according to Ms Oliver , who has co-written with Paul Steinberg the newly published The Road to Martyrs ' Square : A Journey into the World of the Suicide Bomber . 
`` It does not matter whether it is Britain or Syria or the West Bank , they are highly romantic figures , '' she said . 
The fact that they carried with them credit cards and other personal ID suggests they wanted to be known . 
The British media has , in the main , demonised the Yorkshire bombers in much the same way as the IRA was in the 1980s and 1990s . 
The adjectives come readily : fanatics , mad , evil . 
Ms Oliver does not believe suicide bombing is a brave act , but , she says , `` I steer away from the rubric of evil . 
You have to develop a concept of the suicide bomber without either of these extremes '' . 
Suicide bombings , which have their origins in medieval times , can be traced through Japan 's kamikaze pilots to the Iranians during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war , and to the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka . 
The modern version was developed by Hizbollah and its predecessor during the Lebanese civil war , with attacks on the US and then Israelis , and was refined by the Palestinians in 1994-96 and in the second intifada , beginning in 2000 . 
The number of suicide bombings has increased in the past five years , a combination of the Palestinian attacks and those in Iraq , where the numbers now outstrip those in Israel . 
Ms Oliver said : `` The motives are diverse : religion , nationalism , grievance , fame , glory and money , and , last of all and most important of all , they have to have an entire system that supports their actions -LRB- sympathetic groups round the world -RRB- . '' 
She said the Yorkshire bombers would not necessarily have needed outside help from al-Qaida and could have gained all the knowledge , including practical advice , they needed from the internet . 
Boaz Ganor , head of the International Policy Institute for Counter-Terrorism in Herzliya , Israel , disagreed , saying that suicide bombers needed experienced handlers to provide explosives and choose targets . 
His view is that all suicide attacks worldwide are organised by movements . 
`` If one wants to understand the phenomenon , do not understand the motivation of the perpetrator but the motivation of the organization , '' he said . 
For organizations , whether Hamas or al-Qaida , the motivation was the same : the suicide bomber is the most effective weapon available . 
`` The suicide bomber is the smartest of smart bombs . 
He can look around and decide when he can maximize the terror , maximize the casualties , '' Dr Ganor said . 
Even if he is caught , he or she can detonate the explosives , killing those trying to intervene . 
The figures bear out Dr Ganor 's assessment . 
According to Israel , it has faced 160 suicide bombers in the last five years : they account for only 0.6 % of the attacks but half the Israeli casualties - 514 . 
The movements lock the recruits in , in part through the recording of the final videos for release after the bombing . 
Among Palestinians , a further factor , one that does not apply in Yorkshire , is poverty . 
The suicide bomber knows his family will be cared for after his death by various Arab charities and will often be better off than before . 
The family will also enjoy greater prestige . 
Most of the bombers tend to be young , well-educated , and from lower middle-class backgrounds rather than those fighting for daily survival . 
An Israeli government study found that 23 % of suicide bombers between 2000 and this year had been university graduates . 
Their families , like those in Yorkshire , were often unaware of their intentions . 
Dr Ganor said that religion was the predominant motive . 
`` He believes he is carrying out God 's will . 
They do not call it a suicide but shuada , martyrdom . 
They believe they do not die : they just transfer from life to heaven , a one-way ticket . 
And they believe there will be 72 virgins that serve them . '' 
But religion is not the sole explanation . 
The Tamil Tigers were just as eager for self-sacrifice but were not motivated by religion . 
It was a matter of revenge , a way for the powerless to fight back , to create fear . 
There is a desire among jihadists for revenge over what is seen as the brutal treatment of fellow Muslims : Russia 's suppression of Chechnya , the Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank , and the US and British role in Iraq . 
Toby Dodge , one of Britain 's leading academics specialising on Iraq , said that Iraq has had a bigger impact on British Muslims than Chechnya or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . 
`` How Iraq is different is that Americans and British are killing Muslims . 
If you are a radical imam trying to mobilise a set of poorly integrated Yorkshire youths of Pakistani origin , it is a much more potent message to say the Americans and British are killing Muslims , '' Dr Dodge said . 
Ms Oliver said that one of the most important motivating factors was what she described as `` an element of ecstatic camaraderie , which is central to the group '' . 
She believed the Yorkshire bombers shared the happiness of camaraderie . 
`` The people we studied , a Hamas cell , described their time before their death as the happiest day of their life . 
What I have read of the London bombings , police officers described the three guys on CCTV as looking as if they were going on holiday , '' she said .

2005-07-14,"It is an insult to the dead to deny the link with Iraq Tony Blair put his own people at risk in the service of a foreign power Thursday 14 July 2005 03.01 BST In the grim days since last week 's bombing of London , the bulk of Britain 's political class and media has distinguished itself by a wilful and dangerous refusal to face up to reality . 
Just as it was branded unpatriotic in the US after the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington to talk about the link with American policy in the Middle East , so those who have raised the evident connection between the London atrocities and Britain 's role in Iraq and Afghanistan have been denounced as traitors . 
And anyone who has questioned Tony Blair 's echo of George Bush 's fateful words on September 11 that this was an assault on freedom and our way of life has been treated as an apologist for terror . 
But while some allowance could be made in the American case for the shock of the attacks , the London bombings were one of the most heavily trailed events in modern British history . 
We have been told repeatedly since the prime minister signed up to Bush 's war on terror that an attack on Britain was a certainty - and have had every opportunity to work out why that might be . 
Throughout the Afghan and Iraq wars , there has been a string of authoritative warnings about the certain boost it would give to al-Qaida-style terror groups . 
The only surprise was that the attacks were so long coming . 
But when the newly elected Respect MP George Galloway - who might be thought to have some locus on the subject , having overturned a substantial New Labor majority over Iraq in a London constituency with a large Muslim population - declared that Londoners had paid the price of a `` despicable act '' for the government 's failure to heed those warnings , he was accused by defense minister Adam Ingram of `` dipping his poisonous tongue in a pool of blood '' . 
Yesterday , the Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy was in the dock for a far more tentative attempt to question this suffocating consensus . 
Even Ken Livingstone , who had himself warned of the danger posed to London by an invasion of Iraq , has now claimed the bombings were nothing to do with the war - something he clearly does not believe . 
A week on from the London outrage , this official otherworldliness is once again in full flood , as ministers and commentators express astonishment that cricket-playing British-born Muslims from suburbia could have become suicide bombers , while Blair blames an `` evil ideology '' . 
The truth is that no amount of condemnation of evil and self-righteous resoluteness will stop terror attacks in the future . 
Respect for the victims of such atrocities is supposed to preclude open discussion of their causes in the aftermath - but that is precisely when honest debate is most needed . 
The wall of silence in the US after the much greater carnage of 9\/11 allowed the Bush administration to set a course that has been a global disaster . 
And there is little sense in London that the official attitude reflects the more uncertain mood on the streets . 
There is every need for the kind of public mourning that will take place in London today , along with concerted action to halt the backlash against Muslim Britons that claimed its first life in Nottingham at the weekend . 
But it is an insult to the dead to mislead people about the crucial factors fuelling this deadly rage in Muslim communities across the world . 
The first piece of disinformation long peddled by champions of the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan is that al-Qaida and its supporters have no demands that could possibly be met or negotiated over ; that they are really motivated by a hatred of western freedoms and way of life ; and that their Islamist ideology aims at global domination . 
The reality was neatly summed up this week in a radio exchange between the BBC 's political editor , Andrew Marr , and its security correspondent , Frank Gardner , who was left disabled by an al-Qaida attack in Saudi Arabia last year . 
Was it the `` very diversity , that melting pot aspect of London '' that Islamist extremists found so offensive that they wanted to kill innocent civilians in Britain 's capital , Marr wondered . 
`` No , it 's not that , '' replied Gardner briskly , who is better acquainted with al-Qaida thinking than most . 
`` What they find offensive are the policies of western governments and specifically the presence of western troops in Muslim lands , notably Iraq and Afghanistan . '' 
The central goal of the al-Qaida-inspired campaign , as its statements have regularly spelled out , is the withdrawal of US and other western forces from the Arab and Muslim world , an end to support for Israeli occupation of Palestinian land and a halt to support for oil-lubricated despots throughout the region . 
Those are also goals that unite an overwhelming majority of Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere and give al-Qaida and its allies the chance to recruit and operate - in a way that their extreme religious conservatism or dreams of restoring the medieval caliphate never would . 
As even Osama bin Laden asked in his US election-timed video : if it was western freedom al-Qaida hated , `` Why do we not strike Sweden ? '' 
The second disinformation line peddled by government supporters since last week 's bombings is that the London attacks had nothing to do with Iraq . 
The Labor MP Tony Wright insisted that such an idea was `` not only nonsense , but dangerous nonsense '' . 
Blair has argued that , since the 9\/11 attacks predated the Iraq war , outrage at the aggression could not have been the trigger . 
It 's perfectly true that Muslim anger over Palestine , western-backed dictatorships and the aftermath of the 1991 war against Iraq - US troops in Arabia and a murderous sanctions regime against Iraq - was already intense before 2001 and fuelled al-Qaida 's campaign in the 1990s . 
But that was aimed at the US , not Britain , which only became a target when Blair backed Bush 's war on terror . 
Afghanistan made a terror attack on Britain a likelihood ; Iraq made it a certainty . 
We ca n't of course be sure of the exact balance of motivations that drove four young suicide bombers to strike last Thursday , but we can be certain that the bloodbath unleashed by Bush and Blair in Iraq - where a 7\/7 takes place every day - was at the very least one of them . 
What they did was not `` home grown '' , but driven by a worldwide anger at US-led domination and occupation of Muslim countries . 
The London bombers were to blame for attacks on civilians that are neither morally nor politically defensible . 
But the prime minister - who was warned by British intelligence of the risks in the run-up to the war - is also responsible for knowingly putting his own people at risk in the service of a foreign power . 
The security crackdowns and campaign to uproot an `` evil ideology '' the government announced yesterday will not extinguish the threat . 
Only a British commitment to end its role in the bloody occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan is likely to do that .

2005-07-15,"Friday 15 July 2005 00.01 BST An ambitious plan to reform the UN security council by expanding it from 15 members to 25 looks set to fail next week despite one of the most intense diplomatic lobbying exercises ever conducted , according to UN sources . 
The foreign ministers of Germany , Japan , India and Brazil , fighting for a permanent seat each on a new-look council , are to fly to New York at the weekend to try to rescue the plan . 
They need to win two-thirds of the votes of the 191-member UN general assembly . 
But a security council source said the reform was proving difficult to push through . 
`` It is madness . 
They -LRB- Germany , Japan , India and Brazil -RRB- have gone about it completely the wrong way , '' he said . 
`` It is hard to see how it is going to happen . '' 
The fate of the reform package could be decided at a meeting on Sunday or Monday between the four countries and representatives of the 53 African countries . 
The expansion was proposed this year by Kofi Annan , the UN secretary general , to reflect today 's reality rather than the situation after the second world war . 
The reform is also intended to help rebuild the UN 's reputation after criticism of its record in the Balkans , Rwanda and Iraq . 
Mr Annan , after a two-day debate at the UN this week , said : `` I think we all have to admit that the council can be more democratic and more representative . 
`` There is a democracy deficit in the UN governance that has to be corrected . '' 
His plan is intended to be the centrepiece of a meeting of world leaders at the UN in September , billed as the world summit . 
Japan , Germany , Brazil and India , who have organised themselves into the `` G4 '' , have mounted one of the biggest lobbying exercises in history , pushing their embassies to redouble efforts and even recalling retired diplomats with good contacts to help out . 
They have called in many favors . 
The G4 tabled a resolution on Monday , but after two days of debate they found more opposition than they anticipated . 
The G4 foreign ministers are scheduled to meet on Sunday to decide whether to press ahead . 
The security council is dominated by five members with permanent seats and a veto : the US , Britain , France , Russia and China , the second world war victors in 1945 . 
The other 10 are rotated on a two-year basis . 
The permanent presence of countries such as Britain and France and the absence of a permanent place for any country from Africa , Latin America or for Japan , the third biggest financial contributor to the UN , has long been seen as unfair by many in the general assembly . 
The G4 proposes six permanent seats without veto power and four non-permanent seats . 
But , according to the security council source , the G4 is being opposed by Argentina and Chile , which want to block Brazil ; Italy and , to a lesser extent , Spain , which are reluc tant to endorse Germany ; and Pakistan , which is intent on stopping India . 
The G4 is also being opposed at present by all 53 states from Africa - itself almost enough to prevent the necessary majority . 
George Bush , meanwhile , has not forgiven the German chancellor , Gerhard Schrder , for his opposition to the Iraq war . 
Shirin Tahir-Kheli , a US envoy responsible for UN reform , told the general assembly that the US would vote against the resolution . 
Ms Tahir-Kheli acknowledged that 2005 was not 1945 , but said `` security council reform alone will not address the most pressing problems of the organization '' . 
Russia and China are also opposed ; but Sir Emyr Jones Parry , the British ambassador , while making it clear the British government would not give up its place or its veto , told the general assembly Britain would vote for the G4 resolution . 
The African countries yesterday tabled a resolution of their own proposing a 26-member security council in which Africa would have four places instead of the three proposed by the G4 . 
Gunter Pleuger , Germany 's UN ambassador , still insisted : `` We feel that the votes are there . '' 
But the main hope left for the G4 foreign ministers is to try to reach a compromise with the African countries . 
Mr Annan has called a special summit of the UN for September 14 to 16 to discuss reform and progress towards meeting UN goals of halving poverty by 2015 . 
Without the security council reform , he will have lost a large chunk of the agenda .

2005-07-15,"Karl Rove with George Bush . 
Photograph : Ron Edmonds\/AP White House adviser Karl Rove told a grand jury that he discussed with journalists the identity of an outed CIA operative whose public identification has caused a political storm , US media reported today . 
Mr Rove told the grand jury that syndicated newspaper columnist Robert Novak had telephoned him and told him the operative 's name , the Associated Press and the New York Times reported . 
Both AP and the New York Times quoted a person briefed on Mr Rove 's grand jury testimony as the source of their stories . 
The grand jury is investigating the outing of Valerie Wilson , a CIA operative and the wife of Iraq war critic Joseph Wilson . 
Ms Wilson , who has been referred to as Valerie Plame in many media reports , was named in a July 2003 article by Mr Novak . 
In the article , Mr Novak cited two senior administration officials as the source of his story . 
It is a federal offence in some circumstances to reveal the identity of CIA operative , and the article sparked a justice department investigation to find out who had leaked Ms Wilson 's name to journalists . 
The investigation has ensnared presidential aides and reporters in a two-year legal battle . 
The story has also erupted into a political scandal for the US president , George Bush , as Mr Rove is a key adviser and the brains behind Mr Bush 's presidential campaigns . 
Democrats have claimed that the Bush administration was attempting to punish Mr Wilson through his wife in retaliation for Mr Wilson 's public condemnation of faulty intelligence used to justify an attack on Iraq . 
On 6 July 2003 , Mr Wilson wrote a New York Times article criticising the White House for including the allegation that Iraq was attempting to buy nuclear material from the Africa in Mr Bush 's state of the union address . 
Mr Wilson had himself traveled to Niger at the request of the CIA and found that claims Iraq was trying to buy uranium yellowcake from the African country were false . 
Mr Rove told the grand jury in testimony last year that he specifically remembered Mr Novak telling him that Ms Wilson worked for the CIA , AP reported its source , identified only as a person working in the legal profession , as saying . 
Mr Rove told the grand jury that by the time Mr Novak had called him , he believes he had similar information about Mr Wilson 's wife from another reporter but had no recollection of which reporter had told him about it first , the source said . 
Mr Rove testified that Mr Novak originally called him days before Ms Wilson 's identity was revealed in July 2003 to discuss another story . 
The conversation eventually turned to former ambassador Joseph Wilson , who was strongly criticising the Bush administration 's Iraq war policy and the intelligence it used to justify the war , the source said . 
According to Mr Rove 's testimony , Mr Novak told him he had learned and planned to report in a weekend column that Mr Wilson 's wife had worked for the CIA , and the circumstances on how her husband traveled to Africa to check bogus claims of alleged nuclear material sales to Iraq . 
Another journalist , Time reporter Matt Cooper , identified Mr Rove to the grand jury earlier this week as the source for his story regarding Ms Wilson . 
Mr Cooper refused to `` scoop '' himself by discussing precisely what Mr Rove told him before he can publish his story on the pages of Time . 
Mr Rove told the grand jury that four days later , he had a phone conversation with Mr Cooper and - in an effort to discredit some of Mr Wilson 's allegations - told Mr Cooper that Mr Wilson 's wife worked for the CIA , though he never used her name . 
A third reporter , New York Times staffer Judith Miller , is also believed to have known Ms Wilson 's identity . 
She is currently serving a prison sentence for contempt , after refusing to betray a journalistic confidence and testify about her source before the grand jury . 
Mr Novak has refused to discuss his sources or his involvement in the investigation . 
Yesterday the senate Democratic leader , Harry Reid , pressed for legislation to strip Mr Rove of his clearance for classified information , which he said Mr Bush should already have done . 
Instead , Mr Reid said , the Bush administration has attacked its critics : `` This is what is known as a cover-up . 
This is an abuse of power . '' 
The senate majority leader , Bill Frist , a Republican , said Democrats were resorting to `` partisan war chants '' . 
In the house of representatives , Rush Holt , a Democrat , introduced legislation for an investigation that would compel senior administration officials to turn over records relating to the Plame disclosure . 
Mr Rove 's attorney , Robert Luskin , said yesterday that his client had testified truthfully to the grand jury and expected to be exonerated . 
`` Karl provided all pertinent information to prosecutors a long time ago , '' Mr Luskin said . 
`` And prosecutors confirmed when he testified most recently in October 2004 that he is not a target of the investigation . '' 
In an a CNN interview yesterday , before the latest revelation , Mr Wilson kept up his criticism of the White House , saying Mr Rove 's conduct was an `` outrageous abuse of power ... certainly worthy of frog-marching out of the White House '' .

2005-07-18,"Thinktank says war boosts al-Qaida Britain 's involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contributed to the terrorist attacks in London , a respected independent thinktank on foreign affairs , the Chatham House organization , says today . 
According to the body , which includes leading academics and former civil servants among its members , the key problem in the UK for preventing terrorism is that the country is `` riding as a pillion passenger with the United States in the war against terror '' . 
It says Britain 's ability to carry out counter-terrorism measures has also been hampered because the US is always in the driving seat in deciding policy . 
The report says the security services , diverted by fighting the IRA over Northern Ireland and the rise of animal activists committing terrorist acts , failed to give priority in the early 1990s to monitoring Islamist terror activists setting up in Britain , so `` the British authorities did not fully appreciate the threat from al-Qaida '' . 
In the most politically sensitive finding , Chatham House , which used to be known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs , concludes there is `` no doubt '' the invasion of Iraq has `` given a boost to the al-Qaida network '' in `` propaganda , recruitment and fundraising '' , while providing an ideal targeting and training area for terrorists . 
`` Riding pillion with a powerful ally has proved costly in terms of British and US military lives , Iraqi lives , military expenditure and the damage caused to the counter-terrorism campaign . '' 
This finding runs counter to the line from Downing Street , which has sought to detach Iraq from the London attacks . 
On Saturday , Tony Blair said the fanatics who struck in London and launched other attacks around the world were driven by an `` evil ideology '' rather than opposition to any policy , and that it would be a `` misunderstanding of a catastrophic order '' to think that if we changed our behavior they would change theirs . 
Amid the growing debate over proposed terror laws in Britain , the Tories will today offer Charles Clarke , the home secretary , the chance to speed up new laws , provided that the government delays until next year proposals to revise the control orders system for detaining suspect terrorists . 
David Davis , the shadow home secretary , will ask the government to bring forward full details of one of the most divisive parts of the legislation - the indirect incitement to terrorism offence - by a month to September , so MPs and human rights groups such as Liberty can study them properly before the bill is published in October . 
Mr Davis will make his offer during talks today with Mr Clarke , which will also be attended by Mark Oaten , the Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman . 
Lord Falconer , the lord chancellor , indicated yes terday that the government might be prepared to speed up anti-terror measures if it could reach agreement with the opposition parties . 
He told BBC Radio 4 's Westminster Hour : `` We should not rush into things because these things need careful thought . 
But if the opposition parties and the police can reach a consensus with us , then we can do it very quickly . '' 
Azzam Tamimi of the Muslim Association of Britain told a rally in Russell Square , near the scene of the bus bombing , that the Muslim community would not suffer in silence for the crimes of the suicide bombers . 
`` We will continue to talk , we will continue to write and we will continue to challenge the government . 
I say to Muslims , do not bow to pressure to keep accepting those pointing fingers at you . 
`` Say , ` No , I 'm not responsible for what happened on July 7 . 
My heart bleeds , I condemn it , yes , but I did not make those boys angry . 
I did not send those bombs to Iraq . 
I do not keep people locked in Guantnamo Bay and I do not have anything to do with Abu Ghraib , except to denounce it . ' 
Politicians , see what you have done to this world ? '' 
Six people have been arrested in Leeds under the Anti-Terrorism Act , police said last night , but a police source in the capital said the arrests were not linked to the July 7 attacks .

2005-07-18,"The loving boy and murderous terrorist The cousin of Shehzad Tanweer describes her pain and disbelief on learning that he was the Aldgate bomber . 
Monday 18 July 2005 00.01 BST Eleven days ago I watched in horror and disbelief as , one by one , we heard of the four tragic explosions . 
I feared for the lives of friends and relatives in London . 
The following Monday morning , I was boarding a London bus in defiance , just like thousands of other commuters across the city . 
On Tuesday , I heard something beyond imagination . 
Something that would test my community and shatter my family . 
One of the bombers was my cousin . 
I had seen him days before the tragic event , but I had n't seen what was coming . 
Shehzad Tanweer is remembered by his family and friends as a gentle , loving boy who always had a smile on his face . 
By those who lost loved ones in the 7\/7 attacks in London , he is remembered as a murderous terrorist . 
This has come as a terrible blow to the family . 
Not only do they grieve the loss of their son , but they will have to face the atrocities his name has been linked to . 
Shehzad 's parents taught him that violence did n't solve anything , and that violence is not accepted in Islam . 
My parents would always remind me about the meaning of the word Islam - peace . 
I often heard Shehzad 's mother reminding all my cousins about the meaning of the word when they got into arguments with one another , as young siblings do . 
But Shehzad grew into a calm and peaceful young man . 
Nothing could anger him . 
I can not recall the last time I heard him even raise his voice . 
I do n't know why Shehzad did what he did . 
I 've had many a journalist attempt to put suggestions my way . 
Was it because of the Iraq war ? 
Was it the treatment of prisoners at Guantnamo Bay or the Palestine-Israel conflict ? 
I never discussed those issues with him . 
I 'm sure he would have felt very strongly about all those things , just as most Muslims in Britain do . 
I believe the Iraq war was not justified . 
I believe the treatment of alleged war criminals at Guantnamo Bay is a gross misconduct of human rights that every citizen on this planet should be ashamed of . 
And of course , there should be a fair two-state resolution in the Middle East . 
My beliefs are strong but I do not believe they are justification enough to kill innocent people . 
Whatever the reasons for Shehzad 's actions , he took them with him . 
Nobody will ever have the answer , not even his family . 
I have been disturbed by how the bombings have been reported in some parts of the media . 
I have watched how words have been twisted , strewn and bent into whole other shapes by parts of the media . 
I was present at a meeting between Shehzad 's uncle , Bashir Ahmad , and a reporter from the News of the World . 
I heard every word spoken be tween them . 
Three days later I read a conversation that did not take place . 
The entire British public , including the families of the bombers , showed their unity in the two-minute silence that marked the one week anniversary of the terrible 7\/7 bombings . 
Those who lost loved ones do n't want to see any more lives taken by murderous fanatics . 
And relatives of the bombers do n't want to see any more of their children being used as the tools of somebody else 's evil ideology . 
Together , we are looking within ourselves , and our communities , desperately searching for ways to prevent this ever happening again . 
The Sun branded George Galloway a `` traitor '' for questioning the role of the Iraq war in motivating Thursday 's attacks . 
In doing so , they sent a perilous message to every disillusioned Muslim in this country . 
They made it clear dialogue is not an acceptable way to vent our anger at the treatment of Muslims across the world . 
If you silence those who have grievances to air , what tools do you leave them with ? 
My heartfelt apologies go out to all those who lost someone in the attacks . 
If there was anything I could have done to prevent this , I would have done it . 
I know that goes for all my family . 
We did n't want to lose our Shehzad , we believe he was taken from us . 
I have no doubt in my mind that Shehzad was merely a tool of somebody else 's evil ideology . 
I am certain somebody got to him , and duped him . 
I will not rest until that person or group is caught and brought to justice .

2005-07-19,"Labor losing battle to convince public Tuesday 19 July 2005 00.53 BST Two-thirds of Britons believe there is a link between Tony Blair 's decision to invade Iraq and the London bombings despite government claims to the contrary , according to a Guardian\/ICM poll published today . 
The poll makes it clear that voters believe further attacks in Britain by suicide bombers are also inevitable , with 75 % of those responding saying there will be more attacks . 
The research suggests the government is losing the battle to persuade people that terrorist attacks on the UK have not been made more likely by the invasion of Iraq . 
According to the poll , 33 % of Britons think the prime minister bears `` a lot '' of responsibility for the London bombings and a further 31 % `` a little '' . 
Only 28 % of voters agree with the government that Iraq and the London bombings are not connected . 
The poll follows repeated efforts by the government to stress that al-Qaida attacks , including September 11 , took place before , as well after , the invasion of Iraq . 
Yesterday a government spokesman said the prime minister had told the cabinet that people who used Iraq to justify the London bombings had `` a perverse view of Islam '' . 
The foreign secretary , Jack Straw , dismissed a thinktank report which argued that there was a link between the invasion of Iraq and the bombings . 
The report by Chatham House , formerly the Royal Institute of International Affairs , said : `` There is no doubt that the situation over Iraq has imposed particular difficulties for the UK , and for the wider coalition against terrorism . '' 
Mr Straw said in Brussels yesterday : `` I 'm astonished Chatham House is now saying that we should not have stood shoulder to shoulder with our long-standing allies . '' 
`` The terrorists have struck across the world , in countries allied with the US , backing the war in Iraq and in countries which had nothing whatever to do with the war in Iraq . '' 
But the Guardian\/ICM poll shows the public believe that Britain 's frontline role has made the country a more obvious target . 
And it shows that while Britons have reacted relatively calmly to the attacks earlier this month - with 83 % saying they were no less likely to travel into central London and 75 % saying they were just as likely to use the tube - the public does want the government to respond with new legislation . 
A clear majority - 71 % - want the government to exclude or deport from the UK foreign Muslims who incite hatred with only 22 % believing such people should be allowed to live in the UK . 
That may give some comfort to ministers as they seek to persuade opposition parties to support new laws making it an offence to incite terrorism . 
But the poll also shows that despite the attacks , there is increasingly limited public support for ID cards . 
Only 53 % of those questioned said they believed ID cards should be brought in to help in the fight against terrorism - a fall on previous findings before and after the bombings . 
Reflecting the relative cross-party unity that has dominated politics since the attacks , the poll also finds that Labor 's poll lead remains almost unchanged on last month 's Guardian\/ICM findings . 
Despite public unease about the prime minister 's decision to support the invasion of Iraq , Labor has the support of 39 % of voters -LRB- up one point on last month -RRB- , the Conservatives 31 % -LRB- no change -RRB- and the Liberal Democrats 23 % -LRB- no change -RRB- . 
ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,005 adults aged 18 + by telephone between July 15 and 17 . 
Interviews were conducted across the country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all adults .

2005-07-19,"Criticism - of religious intolerance and western violence - is essential Tuesday 19 July 2005 00.53 BST We no longer know what it is to be religious , and have n't for a while . 
During the past 200 years sensible people in the west have contested our religions until they lack significant content and force . 
These religions now ask little of anyone and , quite rightly , play little part in our politics . 
The truly religious , following the logic of submission to political and moral ideals , and to the arbitrary will of God , are terrifying to us and almost incomprehensible . 
To us `` belief '' is dangerous and we do n't like to think we have much of it . 
Confronted by this , it takes a while for our `` liberalism '' to organise itself into opposition and for us to consider the price we might have to pay for it . 
We also have little idea of what it is to burn with a sense of injustice and oppression , and what it is to give our lives for a cause , to be so desperate or earnest . 
We think of these acts as mad , random and criminal , rather than as part of a recognisable exchange of violences . 
The burning sense of injustice that many young people feel as they enter the adult world of double standards and dishonesty shock those of us who are more knowing and cynical . 
We find this commendable in young people but also embarrassing . 
Consumer society has already traded its moral ideals for other satisfactions , and one of the things we wish to export , masquerading as `` freedom and democracy '' is that very consumerism , though we keep silent about its consequences : addiction , alienation , fragmentation . 
We like to believe we are free to speak about everything , but we are reluctant to consider our own deaths , as well as the meaning of murder . 
Terrible acts of violence in our own neighborhood - not unlike terrible acts of violence which are `` outsourced '' , usually taking place in the poorest parts of the third world - disrupt the smooth idea of `` virtual '' war that we have adopted to conquer the consideration of death . 
` Virtual '' wars are conflicts in which one can kill others without either witnessing their deaths or having to take moral responsibility for them . 
The Iraq war , we were told , would be quick and few people would die . 
It is as though we believed that by pressing a button and eliminating others far away we would not experience any guilt or suffering - on our side . 
By bullying and cajoling the media , governments can conceal this part of any war , but only for a while . 
If we think of children being corrupted by video games - imitation violence making them immune to actual violence - this is something that has happened to our politicians . 
Modern western politicians believe we can murder real others in faraway places without the same thing happening to us , and without any physical or moral suffering on our part . 
This is a dangerous idea . 
The only way out is to condemn all violence or to recognize that violence is a useful and important moral option in the world . 
Despite our self-deception , we are quite aware of how necessary it is , at times , to kill others to achieve our own ends and to protect ourselves . 
If we take this position we can not pretend it is morally easy and seek to evade the consequences . 
We were dragged into this illegal and depressing war by many lies and much dissembling . 
A substantial proportion of us were opposed to it . 
During wars ordinary citizens feel they lack information and moral orientation while governments act decisively and with brutality . 
Governments may be representative but they and the people are not the same . 
In our disillusionment , it is crucial that we remind ourselves of this . 
States behave in ways that would shame an individual . 
Governments persuade individuals to behave in ways that individuals know are morally wrong . 
Therefore governments do not speak for us ; we have our own voices , however muffled they may seem . 
If communities are not to be corrupted by the government , the only patriotism possible is one that refuses the banality of taking either side , and continues the arduous conversation . 
That is why we have literature , the theater , newspapers - a culture , in other words . 
War debases our intelligence and derides what we have called `` civilisation '' and `` culture '' and `` freedom '' . 
If it is true that we have entered a spiral of violence , repression and despair that will take years to unravel , our only hope is moral honesty about what we have brought about . 
And not only us . 
If we need to ensure that what we call `` civilisation '' retains its own critical position towards violence , religious groups have to purge themselves of their own intolerant and deeply authoritarian aspects . 
The body hatred and terror of sexuality that characterise most religions can lead people not only to cover their bodies in shame but to think of themselves as human bombs . 
This criticism on both sides is the only way to temper an inevitable legacy of bitterness , hatred and conflict .

2005-07-20,"Wednesday 20 July 2005 00.24 BST Fresh evidence emerged yesterday that the government was privately warned by the intelligence agencies that the conflict in Iraq could provoke terrorist acts in Britain and compound anger among young British Muslims . 
A month before the July 7 London bombings , security and intelligence officials warned that `` events in Iraq are continuing to act as motivation and a focus of a range of terrorist-related activity in the UK '' . 
The warning was issued by the Joint Terrorist Analysis Centre -LRB- Jtac -RRB- , British officials confirmed yesterday . 
Sections of the report were published by the New York Times newspaper . 
A link between the government 's foreign policy and disillusion among young Muslims - strenuously denied by ministers - was also made in a paper prepared for Tony Blair on the orders of the home and foreign secretaries last year . 
The paper , Young Muslims and Extremism , which included input from the security services , said British foreign policy `` seems a particularly strong cause of disillusionment amongst Muslims , including young Muslims '' . 
It referred to `` a perceived ` double standard ' in the foreign policy of western governments ... in particular Britain and the US '' . 
The paper describes `` perceived western bias in Israel 's favor '' as a long-running grievance . 
It adds : `` This perception seems to have become more acute post 9\/11 . 
The perception is that passive ` oppression ' , as demonstrated by British foreign policy , eg non-action on Kashmir and Chechnya , has given way to ` active oppression ' . '' 
The war on terror , Iraq and Afghanistan were all seen by a section of British Muslims as being acts against Islam . 
`` This disillusionment may contribute to a sense of helplessness with regard to the situation of Muslims in the world , with a lack of any tangible ` pressure valves ' , in order to vent frustrations , anger or dissent , '' said the paper . 
Despite this warning last month , Jtac lowered its terrorist threat level on the grounds that there was thought to be no single `` group with both the current intent and the capability to attack the UK '' . 
But it added : `` Whilst the threat from al-Qaida leadership-directed plots have not gone away , many of our current concerns focus on a wide range and large number of extremist networks and individuals in the UK and individuals and groups that are inspired by , but only loosely affiliated to , al-Qaida or are entirely autonomous . ' 
`` Some of these have the potential to plan UK attacks and it is also possible that lone extremists or small groups could attempt lower-level attacks . '' 
The mayor of London , Ken Livingstone , yesterday suggested the four suicide bombers were prompted - at least in part - by long-standing grievances . 
During his weekly press briefing at City Hall , Mr Livingstone said he could not read the bombers ' minds but added : `` I think there were several levels that led those young men to come to London to kill . 
One is 85 years of western intervention in the affairs of the Middle East . '' 
He said the west had repeatedly meddled `` because we wished to preserve oil supplies '' , adding : `` I think for the last nearly 60 years we have this terrible running sore of the dispossession of the Palestinians which is the single most important wound in the Islamic psyche . '' 
The mayor also rounded on media critics of the Muslim cleric Yusef al-Qaradawi , amid reports that the controversial theologian is coming to Britain for a conference early next month . 
Newspapers accuse the cleric of supporting suicide bombing and have called for him to be banned . 
Egypt said yesterday that Magdi el-Nashar , a detained chemist wanted by Britain for questioning over the London bombings , had no links to the attacks nor to al-Qaida . 
A group called Abu Hafs al Masri Brigades , an al-Qaida-linked group , threatened yesterday to launch `` a bloody war '' on the capitals of European countries that do not remove their troops from Iraq within a month . 
The group has no proven record of attacks , and experts have doubted its claims in the past .

2005-07-20,"Wednesday 20 July 2005 09.33 BST Three British soldiers are - for the first time - to stand trial for war crimes against Iraqi detainees under the jurisdiction of the international criminal court -LRB- ICC -RRB- , the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , said last night . 
In an unprecedented move that top military commanders have feared since the ICC Act 's introduction in 2001 , British soldiers face prosecution for the war crime of inhuman treatment of detainees , although the men will face court martial in this country rather than being tried in The Hague . 
Eleven servicemen face a range of charges in two separate cases arising from alleged incidents in the southern Iraqi city of Basra in September 2003 . 
The former commanding officer of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , Colonel Jorge Mendonca , is charged with negligently performing a duty . 
The charges come after a long build-up in which the Ministry of Defense was castigated by the high court for being too slow in getting the prosecution going . 
Senior military figures are seething that British soldiers will face charges under the legislation introduced by the then foreign secretary , Robin Cook , in the face of fierce military opposition . 
British defense officials last night said inhuman treatment would have been unlawful under existing statutes already enshrined in British law . 
But legal sources said the soldiers have been charged , on the advice of the Army Prosecuting Authority , under the ICC Act because that was the most recent legislation covering such allegations . 
In a written parliamentary statement , Lord Goldsmith said that the prosecuting authority has decided that in the first case , seven servicemen should stand trial by court martial . 
The case relates to alleged incidents that took place between September 13 and 15 2003 . 
They are alleged to have committed a number of offences against Iraqi detainees arrested following a planned operation . 
One of the detainees , Baha Da'oud Salim Musa , was allegedly inhumanely treated and killed by one of those charged , Corporal Donald Payne , 34 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment . 
Cpl Payne is also alleged to have inhumanely treated other detainees . 
He faces charges of manslaughter , inhuman treatment of persons - the ICC Act offence - and perverting the course of justice . 
It is further alleged that two other servicemen inhumanely treated the internees , who sustained injuries following repeated assaults . 
Lance Corporal Wayne Crowcroft , 21 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , and Private Darren Fallon , 22 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , are also charged under the ICC Act . 
A fourth serviceman , Sergeant Kelvin Stacey , 28 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , is alleged to have assaulted a detainee and faces a charge of assault causing actual bodily harm , alternatively common assault . 
The three remaining servicemen , Warrant Officer Mark Davies , 36 , of the Intelligence Corps , Major Michael Peebles , 34 , of the Intelligence Corps , and Colonel Jorge Mendonca , 41 , lately of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , are charged with negligently performing their duties or neglecting to perform a duty , contrary to the Army Act 1955 . 
In the second case , the authority directed that four servicemen should stand trial for the manslaughter of Ahmed Kareem , an Iraqi civilian . 
That allegation relates to an incident in Basra on May 8 2003 . 
It is alleged that the four servicemen detained four suspected looters , of whom Mr Kareem was one . 
Three of those charged with the unlawful killing of Mr Kareem are Sergeant Carle Selman , 38 , of the Scots Guards ; Guardsman Martin McGing , 21 , of the Irish Guards ; and Guardsman Joseph McCleary , 23 , also with the Irish Guards . 
Another , 21-year-old lance corporal , with the Irish Guards , has yet to be informed of the charge against him and has not yet been named .

2005-07-20,"Military chiefs furious at betrayal by politicians as prosecutions raise fears of further damage to soldiers ' confidence and reputation Wednesday 20 July 2005 02.08 BST The decision , announced by the attorney general late last night , to prosecute British soldiers for war crimes under the International Criminal Court Act , is a crushing blow for an army known and respected worldwide for its peacekeeping prowess and discipline . 
In the Lords last week , former chiefs of defense staff lined up one after another to harangue the Ministry of Defense for succumbing to `` political correctness '' by allowing British soldiers to be subjected to legal constraints by lawyers who had no idea what it was like to face not a conventional enemy , but insurgents in Iraq , a uniquely dangerous security environment . 
In a Lords debate last Thursday they voiced particular concern about the case of Trooper Kevin Williams of the 2nd Royal Tank Regiment , who was accused of murder in Iraq . 
The case against him eventually collapsed when the crown prosecution service accepted that there was no realistic prospect of conviction . 
They were reflecting deep concerns among serving military chiefs who feel they are being betrayed by their civil and political masters - with the exception , perhaps , of their new and sympathetic defense secretary , John Reid . 
During the debate , Field Marshal the Lord Inge , a former chief of the defense staff , said he dreaded the possibility that British servicemen would be tried by the ICC , warning that any such prosecution would undermine faith in the armed services ' chains of command . 
Lord Boyce , the chief of defense staff at the time of the first war on Iraq , told peers : `` Our armed forces are under legal siege and are being pushed in the direction in which an order could be seen as improper or legally unsound . 
They are being pushed by people not schooled in operations but only in political correctness . '' 
He added : `` If we continue to travel down this road , there will come a point when the close relationship between the commanding officer and his or her people will be lost . 
If that is destroyed the consequences could be serious . '' 
The defense staff were assured by ministers that the ICC statute would have no impact on British soldiers . 
The ICC was supposed to have been an essential plank in new Labor 's `` ethical '' foreign policy advocated by the then foreign secretary , Robin Cook . 
It had been intended to target the war crimes that shocked the international community in such places as the Balkans and Africa . 
Moreover , the US refused to sign up to the ICC and the French obtained a `` get out '' clause for their troops . 
British soldiers , General Sir Mike Jackson , the head of the army , has insisted , are not above the law , but it may be galling for him to see his troops being dragged through the courts when so many others - including American troops - are getting off , the charges against those implicated in the Abu Ghraib prison scandal notwithstanding . 
Earlier this year a military review body reduced the sentences of two soldiers imprisoned for abusing Iraqi civilians in a case that drew comparisons with Abu Ghraib . 
Both were found guilty of abusing Iraqi civilians suspected of looting in May 2003 . 
Their trials in Germany focused on photographs taken of the abuse , which included dangling one man from a forklift truck . 
The photos provoked outrage in Britain , with Tony Blair calling the images `` shocking and appalling '' . 
British soldiers , notably those engaged in fierce fighting against insurgents in Amara , a town some 100 miles north of Basra , have achieved heroic deeds , rewarded by a VC and other honors . 
They have trained Iraqis and negotiated with tribal leaders in a way that has earned a level of trust which is the envy of American military commanders . 
The new reality of policing war zones is a sharp rejoinder to that work but not the first time the modern British army has faced pressures - the most notable example being Northern Ireland . 
The long-awaited , and costly , Saville inquiry report on the events of Bloody Sunday is expected to castigate the parachute regiment and the commanders for killing 13 unarmed Catholics on a civil rights March in Derry in January 1972 . 
Previous reputation aside , those who have mistreated Iraqis amount to only a small fraction of the tens of thousands of British troops who have served there , insists the MoD . 
If only the US had listened to the British and prepared properly for post-invasion things would have been so different , say military chiefs . 
Yet this only part of the picture . 
British troops were ill-equipped and the chain of command cracked up - witness the deaths of six military policemen in southern Iraq in 2003 , deprived of ammunition and unable to communicate with their base . 
Lawsuits damage morale and there are indications that the whole Iraq experience is seriously affecting recruitment , already hit by the scandals at Deepcut barracks . 
Pressure and overstretch is affecting training . 
These are not excuses , but if military commitments cheerfully agreed by the Blair government continue at their present rate without taxpayers prepared to cough up more for the military - and with Britain to take over control of Nato forces in Afghanistan next spring - then the reputation , and discipline , of the British army will be damaged , perhaps irretrievably . 
Two separate cases have resulted in charges . 
The first centres on allegations of offences against Iraqi detainees in Basra in September 2003 and involves seven servicemen . 
One of the detainees , receptionist Baha Da'oud Salim Musa , died . 
Those charged in connection with this case are : Corporal Donald Payne , 34 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment , accused of the manslaughter of Baha Musa . 
Also charged with inhuman treatment of persons and perverting the course of justice . 
Lance Corporal Wayne Crowcroft , 21 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment : inhuman treatment of persons . 
Private Darren Fallon , 22 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment : inhuman treatment . 
Sergeant Kelvin Stacey , 28 , of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment : assault causing actual bodily harm , alternatively common assault . 
Warrant Officer Mark Davies , 36 , of the Intelligence Corps : neglecting to perform a duty . 
Major Michael Peebles , 34 , of the Intelligence Corps : negligently performing a duty . 
Colonel Jorge Mendonca , 41 , lately of the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment : negligently performing a duty . 
The second case involves four servicemen and relates to the alleged killing of Ahmed Kareem , an Iraqi civilian , in Basra on May 8 2003 . 
Sergeant Carle Selman , 38 , of the Scots Guards : unlawful killing of Kareem . 
Guardsman Martin McGing , 21 , of the Irish Guards : unlawful killing of Kareem . 
Guardsman Joseph McCleary , 23 , of the Irish Guards : unlawful killing of Kareem . 
A 21-year-old lance corporal with the Irish Guards has also been charged with the unlawful killing of Kareem but has yet to be informed .

2005-07-21,"There are apologists amongst us The ` We told you so ' lot have been bleating on about Iraq ever since the atrocities of 7\/7 - it is time to fight back Thursday 21 July 2005 02.32 BST Within hours of the bombs going off two weeks ago , the voices that one could have predicted began to make themselves heard with their root-causes explanations for the murder and maiming of a random group of tube and bus passengers in London . 
It was due to Blair , Iraq , illegal war and the rest of it . 
The first voices , so far as I know , were those of the SWP and George Galloway , but it was n't very long - indeed no time at all , taking into account production schedules - before the stuff was spreading like an infestation across the pages of this newspaper , where it has remained . 
No words of dismay , let alone grief , could be allowed to pass some people 's lips without the accompaniment of a `` We told you so '' and an exercise in blaming someone other than the perpetrators . 
No sense of what such a tragedy might call for or rule out on the first day . 
Exactly as if you were to hear from a distraught friend that her husband had just been murdered while walking in a `` bad '' neighborhood , and to respond by saying you were sorry about this but it was foolish of him to have been walking there by himself . 
We had the same after 9\/11 ; still , one nurtures the illusion that people learn . 
Evidently some do n't . 
It needs to be seen and said clearly : there are , among us , apologists for what the killers do . 
They make more difficult the fight to defeat them . 
The plea will be - it always is - that these are not apologists , they are merely honest Joes and Joanies endeavoring to understand the world in which we live . 
What could be wrong with that ? 
Nothing is wrong with genuine efforts at understanding ; on these we all depend . 
But the genuine article is one thing , and root-causes advocacy seeking to dissipate responsibility for atrocity , mass murder , crime against humanity , especially in the immediate aftermath of their occurrence , is something else . 
Note the selectivity in the way root-causes arguments function . 
Purporting to be about causal explanation rather than excuse-making , they are invariably deployed on behalf of movements or actions for which their proponent wants to engage our indulgence , and in order to direct blame towards some party towards whom he or she is unsympathetic . 
A hypothetical example illustrates the point . 
Suppose that , on account of the present situation in Zimbabwe , the government decides to halt all scheduled deportations of Zimbabweans . 
Some BNP thugs are made angry by this and express their anger by beating up a passer-by who happens to be an African immigrant . 
Can you imagine a single person of left or liberal outlook who would blame this act of violence on the government 's decision or urge us to consider sympathetically the root causes of the act ? 
It would n't happen , because the anger of the thugs does n't begin to justify what they have done . 
The root-causers always plead a desire merely to expand our understanding , but they 're very selective in what they want to `` understand '' . 
If causes and explanation are indeed a serious enterprise and not merely a convenient partisan game , then it needs to be recognized that causality is one thing and moral responsibility another , though the two are related . 
The fact that something someone else does contributes causally to a crime or atrocity does n't show that they , as well as the direct agents , are morally responsible for that crime or atrocity , if what they have contributed causally is not itself wrong and does n't serve to justify it . 
Furthermore , even when what someone else has contributed causally to the occurrence of the criminal or atrocious act is wrong , this wo n't necessarily show they bear any of the blame for it . 
The `` We told you so '' crowd all just somehow know that the Iraq war was an effective cause of the deaths in London . 
How do they know this , these clever people ? 
For what they need to know is not just that Iraq was one of a number of influencing causes , but that it was the specific , and a necessary , motivating cause for the London bombings . 
If it was only an influencing motivational cause among others , and if , more particularly , another such motivational cause was supplied by the military intervention in Afghanistan , then it 's not the case that the London bombings would n't have happened but for the Iraq war . 
Ever on the lookout for damning causes , the root-causers never go for the most obvious of these . 
This is the cause , indeed , which shows , by its absence , why most critics of the Iraq war or of anything else do n't murder people when they are angry . 
It is the fanatical , fundamentalist belief system which teaches hatred and justifies these acts of murder . 
That cause somehow gets a free pass from the hunters-out of causes . 
There are apologists among us , and they have to be fought intellectually and politically . 
They do not help to strengthen the democratic culture and institutions whose benefits we all share . 
Because we believe in and value these , we have to contend with what such people say . 
But contend with is precisely it . 
We have to challenge their excuses without let-up .

2005-07-21,"Soldiers may refuse to serve over legal threat Officers say troops will be scared to act and morale will suffer Thursday 21 July 2005 23.58 BST British soldiers will refuse to serve in Iraq if they face the threat of being prosecuted for war crimes , serving and former service personnel warned last night . 
A number of non-commissioned officers who spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity - they are forbidden from talking to the press by Queen 's Regulations - said they had been disgusted to learn that more fellow soldiers face prison as a result of their actions in Iraq . 
One soldier , who served with the Irish Guards in Iraq during the conflict in 2003 and knows the three soldiers charged on Tuesday with war crimes , said : `` It 's going to put all the other lads in a horrible position . 
Everyone is going to be scared to do anything . 
If they get fired upon , they are going to be scared to fire back . 
`` Morale is going to hit rock bottom . 
The situation in Iraq is just going to turn into Northern Ireland . 
People are going to refuse to serve in Iraq or everyone is going to be asking to go on rear party or other duties . '' 
The Irish Guards who have been charged are alleged to have punched and kicked a looter before forcing him into the Shatt al-Basra canal , where he drowned . 
The soldier went on : `` Soldiers will be scared to touch anyone . 
If you run over and crack one of them -LRB- an Iraqi -RRB- on the back of the legs and put them in plasticuffs and nick them and then the MPs are on your patrol and they go back to camp and then pass it on to SIB -LRB- Special Investigation Branch -RRB- and then they decide you are too aggressive , what were you supposed to do ? 
You are told by your commander , ` Right lads , you are going out on aggressive patrol , ' so you have got to go out and patrol aggressively . 
Then they put their umbrellas up and deny all knowledge of this and it 's the average soldier that gets the shit . '' 
One still-serving veteran of the Iraq war called the charges `` a bloody disgrace '' and said : `` It 's hardly going to make anyone want to go there any more than they do at the moment . '' 
He added that soldiers of lower rank were not officially schooled in the Geneva conventions or laws of war . 
The soldier , serving in the newly merged Scottish Regiment , was part of the advance guard sent into the battle zone of central Iraq , alongside US troops . 
A number of his fellow soldiers were killed and others very seriously injured . 
`` It 's a while since I was in Iraq , '' the soldier said . 
`` But even then the feeling was not too high . 
Folk are usually relieved to be sent somewhere else . 
It 's not a popular place to serve , and it 's getting less of one . 
Certainly if you suddenly find you end up in a court because you 're accused ... yes , not by the army , but by politicians '' . 
Talking from barracks in Warminster , Wiltshire , the soldier said : `` People have got to understand that when you 're facing the kind of enemy in Iraq , this is n't an enemy with a uniform . 
This is suicide bombers and stuff . 
It could be anybody . 
You do n't know who is who . 
You do n't know who you are supposed to be protecting and who is going to attack you , whether they 're in a car , or on the street . '' 
Earlier this year four soldiers were convicted in courts martial in Germany of the abuse of Iraqi looters in what became known as the Camp Breadbasket scandal , in which prisoners were forced to strip naked and were photographed simulating sexual positions . 
The four members of the 1st Battalion , the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers claimed that they had been scapegoated and that an order had been given that they `` work '' the looters and force them to run with boxes on their heads . 
In their defense , the soldiers claimed they had not been briefed on the Geneva convention and had not been told how to treat prisoners . 
Last night the soldier with the Scottish Regiment said : `` We do n't really get taught officially what 's in the Geneva convention . 
No one gave me anything to read or anything . 
Maybe there 's a rough idea it exists , you know , about civilians ... yes , prisoners and all that . 
I think the officers might get more details , study it all . 
But no one ever told me to . 
I think most people think that sort of thing is done with proper war , between armies , not terrorism and looting . '' 
Another former corporal , who served on the frontline during Operation Telic - the codename for the British operation in Iraq - but has since left the army , said : `` It 's terrible that it 's happening . 
I do n't think Britain should have signed it -LRB- the International Criminal Court Act 2001 -RRB- in the first place . 
The Americans are exempt from it . 
This is just putting British soldiers ' lives at risk . 
`` I think the fact that these lads are getting prosecuted and it could happen to any other British soldier is wrong . 
If all this was happening 60 years ago , where would we be now ? 
In the present climate it adds more fuel to the fire for these terrorists in Iraq . '' 
Another former soldier , who served in Iraq with the Household Cavalry for six months , said : `` You are out there to do the job . 
If you have got to start thinking about silly things that you might be prosecuted for , you 're putting people 's lives at risk . 
`` If you have got to think about that at a moment 's notice , it is going to be you on the floor and not them . 
It is going to bring the morale of the British soldier down . 
That 's when you will get people refusing to go out and soldier in Iraq . 
I would definitely consider not going out and doing it , especially if I thought I was going to be shot . 
`` The people that are sitting behind a desk that are putting these people through the court , they should really put themselves in the shoes of soldiers and see what he goes through in Iraq and other places like that . 
It 's just constant pressure out there , never knowing when your next bit of rest is going to be . 
You 're always worrying whether you are going to be bombed or shot at , you never know what 's going to happen . ''

2005-07-26,"Hanoi Jane takes on Iraq war with US bus tour Hollywood star accused of using stance to boost book sales , but applauded by some veterans groups Tuesday 26 July 2005 10.10 BST Jane Fonda visits an anti-aircraft position in North Vietnam in July 1972 . 
Photograph : AP Hollywood star and activist Jane Fonda is planning to take a bus tour across America to call for an end to US military operations in Iraq in a move that has already drawn sharp reactions from both the pro- and anti-war camps . 
Ms Fonda , who earned the nickname Hanoi Jane after she was photographed sitting on a north Vietnamese anti-aircraft gun at the height of the Vietnam war , said she would be joined by families of Iraq war veterans and her daughter on the tour . 
`` I 've decided I 'm coming out , '' she told a cheering audience during an appearance in New Mexico to promote her autobiography , explaining that Iraq veterans had encouraged her to break her silence . 
`` I have not taken a stand on any war since Vietnam , '' she added . 
`` I carry a lot of baggage from that . '' 
Ms Fonda said her anti-war tour in March would use a bus that runs on vegetable oil . 
`` I ca n't go into any detail except to say that it 's going to be pretty exciting , '' she said . 
Ms Fonda is still reviled by many Vietnam veterans for her stance and actions during the Vietnam war . 
In her autobiography , My Life So Far , she said she was not thinking about what she was doing when she sat on the aircraft gun , and the impression it gave that she was the enemy of American soldiers and veterans was something she still carried `` heavy in my heart '' . 
But Ted Sampley , vice president of Rolling Thunder , one of the largest Vietnam Veterans organizations , said it was a case of deja vu . 
`` She has no credibility ; she is going to make a lot of people mad , me being one of them , '' he said . 
Jim Phillips , a Middle East analyst at the Heritage Foundation , a right-wing Washington think-tank , said : `` Her book sales are not going too well so I guess she has latched on to the Iraq war as a way of staying in the news . 
`` She is irrelevant , and I just see her the same as Tom Cruise , spouting off about things they know nothing about . '' 
But anti-war groups were generally supportive of the Hollywood star . 
Wes Hamilton , 57 , a former Vietnam soldier and a member of United States Veterans for Peace , said : `` I 'm excited about it frankly and I really applaud her for what she is doing . 
It is critical to keep the war in the public attention . 
`` I was just back from Vietnam when she made her controversial journey . 
There was a tremendous division in the US ... I was still in the Marines or recently discharged and my point was that whatever it takes to get the conversation in the media is important . '' 
`` The people from my generation are the ones who did stand up and bring the Vietnam war to its conclusion . 
If it means bringing that generation back together again and getting a new generation to stand up to stop this war then so be it . '' 
Judy Linehan , a spokeswoman for Military Families Speak Out , said : `` She was maligned and there was an over-reaction to what she did . 
She is a mature woman and has evolved in her politics but is the same passionate woman who believes in justice and I hope that is what comes across . '' 
Mrs Linehan , whose son , Colin , served as a doctor in Iraq between November 2003 and October 2004 , said the main problem for Ms Fonda would be the American press . 
`` The danger will be that they just pick up on the surface layer , but I would hope people will welcome anybody who can stir a discussion on Iraq and draws attention to the real issues . ''

2005-07-27,"Wednesday 27 July 2005 23.59 BST It was so attractive that the people of Lille were already flocking to it , months before the official opening : two hectares of green grass , 250 shady chestnut and lime trees , fountains and a children 's play area , all bang in the middle of France 's biggest and busiest northern city . 
Sadly , the brand-new Parc Jean-Baptiste Lebas is currently firmly closed , its perimeter fence patrolled by watchful policemen while a mine clearance team more used to working in Bosnia , Afghanistan and Iraq finishes ridding it of a potentially deadly crop of first world war grenades . 
So far they have found some 200 . 
`` Thankfully no one has been hurt , but obviously we have to to take every possible precaution , '' said a city hall official . 
`` There is no question of anyone else being allowed in again until we are sure it 's safe . '' 
The scare started this month when the parents of a four-year-old boy found him playing with a lemon-sized lump of hardened earth which , on closer inspection , turned out to be a German Heer Handgranat dating from 1915 , containing 30 grams -LRB- 1oz -RRB- of unstable explosive , and capable of maiming anyone within a 25-metre radius . 
Gardeners and building workers on the site next to the city hall began hunting for more with rakes , at first with little success . 
But then a park visitor stumbled across another one , and `` quite suddenly , a whole bunch came to the surface after some heavy rainfall '' , the official said . 
The town hall called in a Toulouse-based demining company . 
Using advanced metal detectors , the company , Geomines , has spent five days inching across the new park , until recently a five-lane boulevard and car park , uncovering first eight , then 23 , then 70 , then 96 and finally 189 of the grenades , some twisted by earthmovers that had , miraculously , failed to set them off . 
ISS Espaces Verts , the contractors , told the local newspaper La Voix du Nord that after a painstaking inquiry it had come to the conclusion that of the tens of thousands of tonnes of soil it had trucked in to create the park , a portion came from the villages of Santes , Loos and Wambrechies - through which , for many months , ran the frontline of the 1914-18 war . 
`` We 've been lucky , '' the city hall official said . 
The people of Lille are used to such scares : three years ago , more than a thousand were evacuated when workers uncovered a 110kg British bomb buried on the site of the new regional council building .

2005-07-28,"As the clock turns back Iraq 's draft constitution is about to go before the national assembly for approval . 
It seems likely to mean a massive erosion of women 's rights , says Margaret Owen If ever the women of Iraq needed support from the international community , the UN , and , in particular , the UK government , it is now . 
With only two weeks until the country 's draft constitution is due to be ready -LRB- the deadline is August 15 -RRB- who else can help Iraqi women to prevent the total erosion of their human rights - rights they have enjoyed , in a secular state , since 1959 ? 
Tony Blair , who continues to justify the invasion of the country as the only means to topple a brutal dictatorship and help to establish democracy , now has an obligation to use all his powers to avert a new dictatorship in Iraq - that of the mullahs over women . 
The unparalleled violence of the past 30 years - three wars , the horrors perpetrated by Saddam Hussein and the killings of thousands of Iraqi civilians since the occupation - have meant the majority of the Iraqi population is female . 
Furthermore , it is estimated that more than 60 % of this majority are female heads of households , as widows or wives of the `` disappeared '' . 
There is barely a family that does not have its unprecedented share of widows and single women . 
And it is these women who must shoulder the sole responsibility for raising the next generation , the orphans and children , and caring for the wounded , sick , elderly and traumatised . 
Apart from considerations of humanity and human rights , the future of Iraq will depend greatly on its women , many of whom , in the hitherto secular state , are well-educated professionals and a key resource in the reconstruction of the economy as well as the social fabric of communities . 
Women therefore have a crucial role to play in post-conflict reconstruction , so it is vital that their rights are protected in accordance with standards enshrined in international law - laws to which Iraq has signed up . 
The Security Council resolution 1325 requires that women are treated equally and are enabled to participate fully and proportionately in decision-making . 
Only then can there be hope for the establishment of good governance , democracy and justice . 
The Beijing Platform for Action also stresses the requirement to ensure that women are represented in peace negotiations and points up women 's unique roles in building bridges across ethnic and religious divides . 
Rwanda and South Africa , where women are now equal partners in government , are fine illustrations of what can be achieved when women 's rights are expressly guaranteed in any new constitution . 
In March 2004 , Iraq adopted an interim constitution called the Tal -LRB- transitional administrative law -RRB- . 
It was then that Iraqi women won their battle to stop the passing of the proposed rule 137 , which , if promulgated , would have destroyed all hopes for women 's equality , dignity and justice in the country , in effect allowing the total subordination of women to men within their families , in the community and in political life . 
This particular interpretation of the Qur ` an would legalise polygamy ; divorce by `` talaq '' -LRB- when a husband has only to declare `` I divorce you '' three times for the marriage to be at an end -RRB- ; honor killings ; stoning and public beheadings of women for alleged adultery . 
But now rule 137 's provisions are back in the new draft constitution . 
Despite the appalling security situation in Iraq -LRB- two Sunni members of the committee who are drafting the constitution were gunned down last week -RRB- , thousands of brave Iraqi women , from different governorates , risked their lives last Tuesday when they congregated in Baghdad 's Al-Firdaws Square to protest against their exclusion in the draft constitution . 
The international press , busy reporting the continuing violence of the insurgency , failed to cover this event and it got little publicity within Iraq . 
At one point in the rally , a small group of women arrived to mount their own demonstration - shouting slogans demanding that the Qur ` an be the sole source of law in the constitution . 
Their curious presence illustrates neatly the additional fear that even if 25 % of the membership of all decision-making bodies , including the national assembly , are reserved for women , some will be little more than puppets , put forward by those very parties that believe that women 's place is not in politics , but subservient to men and in the home . 
-LRB- The 25 % quota was included in the interim constitution thanks to the laudable efforts of Sir Jeremy Greenstock when he was our man in Baghdad in 2004 , but it is only to be followed for the next two elections . 
After that the quota will lapse . -RRB- 
The drafts released last weekend are a cause for deepest concern . 
Written by a committe of 46 men and nine women , they expressly state that the main source of legislation in the new Iraqi constitution is to be sharia law , which will take precedence over international law . 
Sharia law decrees that `` personal status '' -LRB- that is , family law relating to marriage , divorce , custody , widowhood and inheritance -RRB- is to be determined according to the different religious sects . 
Depriving women of their long-held rights and rendering them subservient to interpretations of Islamic law could well lead to the `` Talibanisation '' of Iraq and an escalation of violence towards women who rebel . 
Indeed extremists and insurgents are already using rape , acid attacks and violence to force women to wear the veil . 
Now a law is set to be passed that will ban widows from working for three months following the deaths of their husbands . 
These developments have caused deep dismay among women 's organizations across Iraq , whether Kurds , Sunnis or Shias . 
Iraqi women have campaigned and lobbied hard over the past few months , often risking great personal danger - several politically active women have been assassinated , abducted , raped or threatened - for the new constitution to guarantee women 's rights and abide by international treaties . 
What can be done to ensure that women 's voices are heard ? 
Conferences , workshops , rallies and seminars seem to have no effect . 
At a meeting in Jordan only three weeks ago , at an undisclosed location for reasons of security , men and women from the Constitutional Drafting Committee and the Transitional Assembly vigorously discussed the issue of women 's rights . 
But already it seemed clear that it would be impossible to arrive at any consensus by the August 15 deadline , whether about women 's rights , or about federalism , the place of international conventions , or such basic principles as the right to life . 
`` Leave that till we have hung Saddam , '' commented one national assembly member . 
Another , in a formal speech , remarked , `` If we had 30 % of women in our national assembly we would never get anything done '' , and offered the suggestion : `` Husbands should be able to punish their wives , providing that they leave no mark of injury . '' 
The majority of participants voted for a postponement - and a postponement of six months is permitted . 
But the Bush administration would clearly like to see all the deadlines , for the constitution , referendum and next election , met so that it can withdraw US troops from Iraq . 
But delivering a constitution that so flagrantly breaches all international laws on human rights and equality , and is so totally discriminatory of , and unacceptable to , the vast majority of Iraqi women , is not acceptable in the name of `` democracy '' . 
If Iraq is truly to become a democratic state , complying with international human rights treaties and conventions , then its constitution , while upholding sharia law , must ensure that its interpretation does not breach its international obligations . 
It is unprecedented to rush the writing of a document as important as a constitution , because once written , it will determine the future of the country and the lives of its people . 
Civil society , both male and female , must be consulted . 
But the present state of near civil war is not the best time to take soundings , or educate and inform the population on the meaning of a constitution , and its importance for their future - another reason surely for a postponement . 
Every day in Iraq , women are beaten , raped , abducted and murdered in `` honor killings '' . 
Millions more live in poverty and fear . 
The new constitution must uphold their rights , for we know that it is only when women have equality with men that there can be true democracy , justice and peace . 
Iraqi women are imploring the international community to act to protect the lives of 13 million women . 
Tony Blair and Jack Straw must not remain silent .

2005-07-28,"Brazilian did not wear bulky jacket Relatives say Met admits that , contrary to reports , electrician did not leap tube station barrier Thursday 28 July 2005 18.32 BST Jean Charles de Menezes , the Brazilian shot dead in the head , was not wearing a heavy jacket that might have concealed a bomb , and did not jump the ticket barrier when challenged by armed plainclothes police , his cousin said yesterday . 
Speaking at a press conference after a meeting with the Metropolitan police , Vivien Figueiredo , 22 , said that the first reports of how her 27-year-old cousin had come to be killed in mistake for a suicide bomber on Friday at Stockwell tube station were wrong . 
`` He used a travel card , '' she said . 
`` He had no bulky jacket , he was wearing a jeans jacket . 
But even if he was wearing a bulky jacket that would n't be an excuse to kill him . '' 
Flanked by the de Menezes family 's solicitor , Gareth Peirce , and by Bianca Jagger , the anti-Iraq war campaigner , she condemned the shoot-to-kill policy which had led to her cousin 's death and vowed that what she called the `` crime '' would not go unpunished . 
`` My cousin was an honest and hard working person , '' said Ms Figueiredo who shared a flat with him in Tulse Hill , south London . 
`` Although we are living in circumstances similar to a war , we should not be exterminating people unjustly . '' 
Another cousin , Patricia da Silva Armani , 21 , said he was in Britain legally to work and study , giving him no reason to fear the police . 
`` An innocent man has been killed as though he was a terrorist , '' she said . 
`` An incredibly grave error was committed by the British police . '' 
Mr de Menezes was shot seven times in the head and once in the shoulder at 10am last Friday after being followed from Tulse Hill . 
Scotland Yard initially claimed he wore a bulky jacket and jumped the barrier when police identified themselves and ordered him to stop . 
The same day the Met commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , said the shooting was `` directly linked '' to the unprecedented anti-terror operation on London 's streets . 
The following day Sir Ian apologised when detectives established that the Brazilian electrician , on his way to a job in north-west London , was not connected to attempts to blow up three underground trains and a bus in the capital . 
The Independent Police Complaints Commission has began an inquiry which is expected to take several months . 
Yesterday it emerged one armed officer involved has been given leave , and two have been moved to non-firearm duties . 
Ms Figuerdo condemned Sir Ian 's decision to authorise the leave , saying she wanted to see the man who shot her cousin , and he should be in jail . 
The body of Mr de Menezes is being flown to Brazil tonight for a funeral tomorrow . 
Simultaneously , a memorial service will be held at Westminster Cathedral , with TV coverage beamed live to Brazil . 
Ms Peirce condemned Sir Ian 's statements on the case , saying there had been a `` regrettable rush to judgment '' . 
She was astonished that the phrase `` shoot to kill '' was being used as if it was a legitimate legal term ; the family would demand `` transparency '' both as to the facts of what had happened and on the policy . 
She added that the family were ready to cooperate with the complaints body , and she saw no reason for delay : `` They know what their questions are and we see no reasons why they should not be answered .

2005-07-29,"Friday 29 July 2005 15.34 BST The television debut of a new Iraq war drama from the creator of Hill Street Blues , NYPD Blue and LA Law has proved highly controversial in the US . 
More than 4 million people tuned in to the Steven Bochco 's Over There for its first screening on the FX channel on Wednesday night . 
The ratings figures beat the 2003 premiere of cosmetic surgery drama Nip\/Tuck and made it the most watched show on cable TV , according to Nielsen Media Research . 
It is the first time that a TV series has been shown about a war that still rages , but Mr Bochco claims he has purposely steered away from making any political point in the series . 
`` I do n't want to politicise the show in any way , '' he said . 
`` I do n't think it 's relevant to the dramatisation of this war , and of the men and women who are in uniform and in harm 's way . 
`` I think the moment you take a political position , you 're not doing what art is supposed to do , which is to ask provocative questions . '' 
But as concern about the validity of the war in Iraq grows in the US - only 43 % of Americans predict victory , although a majority believes the war is just , according to the latest Gallup poll - the show has provoked mixed reactions . 
Gory battle scenes - in one an insurgent is blown up by a grenade and momentarily his legs continue to run - graphic language and discontent , confusion and fear among soldiers have shocked some US viewers and critics more used to the gentle humor of 70s series M \* A \* S \* H. The 13-part series , which will be seen in the UK on Sky 1 next year , follows seven soldiers and their loud-mouthed sergeant , and references real-life events , such as the abuse of prisoners by US soldiers in the Abu Ghraib jail . 
`` Do you have a bag for my head ? 
Do you want me to take my clothes off now ? '' 
shouts one captured insurgent . 
The Washington Post 's reviewer accused Mr Bochco , the show 's creator , of reaching for the `` bag of attention-grabbing cheap tricks '' . 
The New York Times said the show `` dramatises wartime slaughter and suffering that all too often goes unnoticed ; its expertly filmed scenes at times overshadow the soldiers themselves . 
The danger is that viewers could end up loving the war as much as they love the troops . '' 
And New Yorker TV critic Nancy Franklin said : `` There 's an overall pointlessness to the show that 's rather shocking , considering the outrageous lies and arrogance that got us into the war . 
`` But pointlessness may be inevitable in a country where , at the moment , to risk telling the truth - beyond the truth that soldiers die in war and things are tough on the home front , too - is to be condemned as unpatriotic . '' 
Christian title World Magazine barely contains its outrage : `` In accord with the antiwar movie clich , the officers are indifferent and incompetent , '' said reviewer Gene Edward Veith . 
`` But for all of the series ' ostensible sympathy for the front-line troops , it treats them with palpable condescension . '' 
While Betty Delgado , whose son is serving in Afghanistan , cried as she watched the show for the Daily News : `` It puts you right there . 
Just seeing it , it scares me to know that 's what he 's doing . '' 
USA Today critic Robert Bianco said : `` Setting a TV series in Iraq while the war still rages is a risky and , some have said , a presumptuous proposition . 
`` Yet by focusing Over There not on the war but on its warriors , -LRB- co-creator -RRB- Chris Gerolmo and TV icon Steven Bochco have turned risk into triumph , creating what may be the most harrowing and realistic portrait of warfare ever captured by an American television series , '' concluded Bianco .

2005-07-31,"Rome captive ` says Iraq sparked plot ' Security chiefs fear new wave of assaults Huge hunt for bomb mastermind Death gangs were linked , say police One of the men accused of taking part in the failed terror attacks in London on 21 July has claimed the bomb plot was directly inspired by Britain 's involvement in the Iraq war . 
In a remarkable insight into the motives behind the alleged would-be bombers , Hussain Osman , arrested in Rome on Friday , has revealed how the suspects watched hours of TV footage showing grief-stricken Iraqi widows and children alongside images of civilians killed in the conflict . 
He is alleged to have told prosecutors that after watching the footage : ` There was a feeling of hatred and a conviction that it was necessary to give a signal - to do something . ' 
But some of the Italian media reports told a conflicting story . 
Some reports quoted Osman as saying : ' I hardly know anything . 
They only gave me a rucksack to carry on the tube in London . 
We wanted to stage an attack , but only as a show . 
Who gave me the explosive ? 
I do n't know . 
I did n't know him . 
I do n't remember . 
We did n't want to kill , we just wanted to scare people . ' 
Milan 's Corriere della Sera newspaper said Osman first told authorities he did not know what was in the backpack he took on the London underground , then changed his version , saying he was told the attackers were only supposed to carry out ` demonstrative ' attacks . 
But the Rome daily Il Messaggero said the suspect told investigators : ` We were supposed to blow ourselves up . ' 
Osman allegedly said : ` More than praying we discussed work , politics , the war in Iraq ... we always had new films of the war in Iraq ... more than anything else those in which you could see Iraqi women and children who had been killed by US and UK soldiers . ' 
If these reports turn out to be true , they will provide valuable insights into the workings of the alleged terrorist cells . 
The revelations come as police in the UK begin hunting an al-Qaeda mastermind believed to be behind the recruitment and training of both sets of London bombers . 
The prospect of a UK mastermind controlling the cells raises fears that other units may be active in Britain . 
Despite the arrest of all five men wanted in connection with the failed attacks , the Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Sir Ian Blair , warned last night of the risk of further bomb attacks . 
According to the reports , Hussain claimed the men did not talk about al-Qaeda or Osama bin Laden . 
` We had no contacts with the organization of bin Laden . 
We knew it existed - we accessed its programs through the internet - but nothing directly , ' he is reported to have claimed , adding that the bombings of 7 July took them by surprise : ` We never had any contact with the Pakistanis . ' 
However , the bombs that devastated London that day were a signal that they could go into action . 
` Our boss taught us how to make explosives out of fertilisers , ' he is reported to have said , claiming the men put them into rucksacks and used timers . 
Security sources fear that at least one senior figure in the global terror organization is based in the UK . 
He may have taken part in a whitewater rafting trip used as a bonding session for several of the suicide bombers in north Wales in early June . 
Sweeping new security measures are to be introduced on Britain 's road and rail networks this week , including highway patrol officers on the M25 who will check bridges for bombs . 
Senior officers are particularly concerned there could be a third attack on Thursday , two weeks after the last attempt . 
One officer said : ` When you look at the history of terrorist attacks and of al-Qaeda in particular , there is a pattern of repeated attacks on the same targets . 
They hit the World Trade Centre twice . 
They attacked the embassies in Egypt twice . 
If anything the level of security around public transport on Thursday will be even higher than last . ' 
Rather than the two cells being linked directly , investigators are now focusing on the idea that the men responsible for the 7 July bombs and those behind the failed attacks on 21 July may have been recruited and directed by the same person . 
` If you look at the structure of al-Qaeda , what you basically have is a pyramid , ' a security source told The Observer . 
` If you see the two groups of bombers as two separate teams of footsoldiers on the very bottom , then there is a possibility they are linked by the command structure in the level above . 
This is the level we are trying to identify and track down . ' 
The hunt has been given fresh impetus by this new intelligence which suggests that , rather than being manufactured between them , the explosives given to the bombers were handed over by people so far unidentified . 
Italian officials are preparing extradition proceedings against Osman . 
They say he was born in Ethiopia , not Somalia , and may have used fake documents to obtain British citizenship . 
The Interior Minister , Giuseppe Pisanu , told his parliament yesterday that Osman had tried to evade capture with the help of contacts among Italy 's Ethiopian and Eritrean immigrant communities , after fleeing London on the Eurostar train . 
The suspect appeared before magistrates yesterday . 
His lawyer , Antonietta Sonnessa , objected to his extradition and said it could take up to two months for him to be returned to London . 
It has also emerged that Britain 's Somali community ` shopped ' the first alleged bomber , Hassan Omar , who was found in Birmingham last Wednesday .

2005-08-04,"Thursday 4 August 2005 09.32 BST Ayman al-Zawahri , al-Qaida 's second-in-command , speaks in a video aired by al-Jazeera in which he warned Britons that Tony Blair 's policies will bring more destruction to London . 
Photograph : al-Jazeera\/Reuters Osama bin Laden 's deputy blamed Tony Blair 's foreign policy for the London bomb attacks in a video broadcast today and warned of `` more destruction '' to come . 
Al-Qaida 's No 2 , Ayman al-Zawahiri , said the suicide bombings in London on July 7 , described as `` volcanoes of wrath '' , had followed the UK 's rejection of an offer of a `` truce '' from al-Qaida conditional on withdrawing troops from Iraq . 
In a message broadcast this afternoon on the Qatar-based al-Jazeera television station , Zawahiri said : `` Blair 's policies will bring more destruction to Britons after the London explosions , God willing . '' 
Downing Street refused to make any immediate comment on the tape , which is the first message from al-Qaida 's inner circle to directly mention last month 's suicide bombings in which 52 people were murdered . 
Tonight the US president , George Bush , said he would not be deterred by threats from Zawahiri , who warned that the US faced worse casualties in Iraq than in Vietnam . 
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks , the prime minister denied the Iraq war was a factor . 
He said later , after the foreign policy thinktank Chatham House linked Iraq with the attacks , that the war was `` an excuse '' , but argued that terrorists with an `` evil ideology '' would always find grievances to justify attacks . 
Today Zawahiri said that al-Qaida 's message was clear : `` You will not be safe until you withdraw from our land , stop stealing our oil and wealth and stop supporting the corrupt rulers . '' 
Egyptian-born Zawahiri did not claim responsibility for the London attacks but rather put the al-Qaida stamp of approval on them , which has increasingly become the new dynamic as the terror organization , deprived of its training camps in Afghanistan , changes in nature . 
Analysts have said it is unlikely that the London bombings were directly organised by the al-Qaida leadership in a way that the September 11 attacks were . 
It is thought that they were more likely to have been inspired by al-Qaida , in a similar way to last year 's Madrid bombings , which claimed 191 lives . 
The July 7 attacks were carried out by four suicide bombers , three of whom lived in West Yorkshire . 
However there has been speculation that they could have been orchestrated by a `` mastermind '' who traveled to the country , recruited Britons and gave them training and help with explosives and fled before the attacks were carried out . 
Experts said it was probably no coincidence that the Zawahiri tape emerged on a Thursday , exactly four weeks on from the Thursday July 7 attacks and two weeks after the failed bomb attacks on Thursday July 21 . 
As the tape was broadcast , around 6,000 police were out in force in a major London security operation today . 
-LRB- Read more here -RRB- Scotland Yard has warned of more attacks , although there is no specific intelligence anticipating an attack today and senior officers have said there is no hard evidence that a `` third cell '' that is still at large . 
The Zawahiri tape is sure to be scrutinised by British anti-terror officers . 
In it , Zawahiri refers to an audio tape broadcast by the al-Arabiya television station last April in which a speaker purported to be Bin Laden offered a ceasefire to nations deciding not to `` interfere '' in Muslim countries . 
The offer was not extended to the US . 
In today 's tape , Zawahiri says : `` As to the nations of the crusader alliance , we have offered you a truce if you leave the land of Islam . 
Has n't Sheik Osama bin Laden told you that you will not dream of security before there is security in Palestine and before all the infidel armies withdraw from the land of Mohammed ? 
Instead , you spilled blood like rivers in our countries , and we exploded the volcanoes of wrath in your countries . '' 
Zawahiri also warned the US that `` tens of thousands '' of its military personnel would die if they did not immediately withdraw from Iraq and that continuation of US aggression against Muslims would make `` you forget the horrible things in Vietnam and Afghanistan '' . 
The footage showed Zawahiri wearing white robes , with an AK47 assault rifle by his side . 
Behind him was a muddy brown sackcloth of a kind often used in al-Qaida tapes to hide geographical features that could provide clues to where they were filmed . 
Livingstone calls for Iraq pullout Zawahiri 's comments are sure to rekindle debate about how involvement in Iraq has endangered the UK . 
In today 's Guardian newspaper , the mayor of London , Ken Livingstone , argued that British troops should be withdrawn from Iraq to help protect the city from more attacks , because the invasion was `` not justified '' . 
Zawahiri is a former eye doctor who merged his militant group with al-Qaida in Afghanistan in the late 90s . 
Like Bin Laden , he has a $ 25m bounty on his head and some experts regard him as the prime force behind al-Qaida 's ideology . 
He last appeared in a video aired by al-Jazeera in June , in which he called for an armed struggle to expel `` crusader forces and Jews '' from Muslim states and said that peaceful change was impossible . 
The last videotape from Bin Laden emerged on October 29 last year ahead of the US elections on November 2 . 
In it he threatened another attack like September 11 and said : `` Bush is still deceiving you ... and therefore the reasons are still there to repeat what happened '' . 
Some UK and US officials have expressed anxieties about the media broadcasting messages from al-Qaida . 
Bin Laden and Zawahiri are suspected to be hiding somewhere around the Afghanistan-Pakistan border are the subject of a manhunt on a huge scale that has so far proved fruitless . 
Suspect has Italian court date set In other developments today , an extradition hearing has been set for August 17 in Rome for Hussein Osman , one of the chief suspects in July 21 attacks , who was arrested in the Italian capital last week . 
-LRB- Read more here -RRB- Ray Kelly , the New York police commissioner , is likely to have caused more consternation in Scotland Yard after disclosing new details about the July 7 investigation , a week after the Met appealed to international agencies to be discrete with shared information . 
Mr Kelly said the bombs were probably detonated using mobile phones and the explosives included hair bleach . 
Scotland Yard refused to comment .

2005-08-04,"The July 7 attacks in London were not an individual act of terrorism but one episode in a worldwide conflict , say researchers at Oxford University . 
Philip Ball reports Thursday 4 August 2005 00.02 BST The third world war has already started . 
It is not George Bush 's rhetorical `` war on terror '' , but terrorism itself . 
In other words , terrorism is the new war . 
A recent analysis of the casualty statistics of global terrorism shows they follow the pattern previously observed for conventional conflicts ranging from small local skirmishes to the second world war . 
In at least two continuing conflicts not generally regarded as terrorist in nature - in Iraq and Colombia - the statistics are converging on the form seen for global terrorism , perhaps indicating that governments need to deal with wars differently . 
According to Neil Johnson , a physicist at Oxford University and one of the team that studied the figures , the findings raise the possibility that both conflicts `` are a part of one big ongoing global war - a mother of all wars '' . 
If that is so , London is embroiled in it , too . 
The casualty figures for the July 7 bombings `` absolutely fall in line '' with what the analysis of terrorism statistics predict , says Johnson . 
But how can a single , simple -LRB- if gruesome -RRB- statistic such as the number of people killed in attacks tell us anything meaningful about events and conflicts conducted in completely different places for what seem to be totally different reasons ? 
Is n't this like expecting to understand a country 's culture by counting its population ? 
That depends on what you are looking for . 
When he first studied the statistics of `` deadly quarrels '' 80 years ago , the British physicist Lewis Fry Richardson wanted to understand why wars happen . 
Richardson , a Quaker who served as an ambulance driver in the first world war , hoped that such insight could promote world peace . 
He decided first to find out how wars were distributed according to their size . 
In the 1920s , Richardson plotted the fatality statistics for 82 wars fought since 1820 on a graph showing the size of the conflicts on one axis and the number of conflicts of that size on the other . 
He found that the data fitted onto a smooth curve which , when the numbers were plotted as logarithms , became a straight line . 
This sort of mathematical relationship is known as a power law . 
The line slopes `` downwards '' because there are progressively fewer conflicts of ever greater size : little wars are common ; big ones rare . 
The power law continued to hold as the data embraced conflicts such as the second world war and Vietnam . 
Richardson 's discovery of power-law statistics of conflicts has been followed subsequently by the recognition that power laws govern all sorts of `` social '' statistics , from the sizes of towns to the fluctuations of economic markets and the network structure of the world wide web . 
Power-law statistics of event sizes are also found for natural phenomena that occur close to points of instability , such as earthquakes and avalanches . 
This suggests that social systems prone to power-law statistics , such as economic markets and international relations , also operate on the brink of instability . 
Earlier this year , computer scientists Aaron Clauset and Maxwell Young at the University of New Mexico showed that the fatalities from acts of terrorism since 1968 also follow a power law . 
`` We were very surprised , '' Clauset says . 
`` It made us think that there may be some deep , underlying connection between terrorism and wars . '' 
But they found that not all terrorism is the same . 
There are two different power laws - one that fits the figures for terrorist attacks in industrialised -LRB- G8 -RRB- nations ; and another for attacks in the rest of the world . 
The slope of the straight-line plot was steeper in the latter case , indicating that attacks in industrialised nations are more rare but more severe when they do occur . 
The attacks of September 11 indicate precisely that , as do the London bombings . 
Johnson has teamed up with economist Mike Spagat at Royal Holloway College in London , a specialist in the Colombian conflict , and researchers in Bogot , Colombia , to apply the same kind of analysis to this continuing struggle between the government and several left - and rightwing insurgent groups . 
The conflict has been going on since the 1980s , and at face value it resembles neither a terrorist-style confrontation nor a conventional war . 
But the researchers found that the fatality statistics for individual attacks since 1989 also follow a power law . 
More strikingly still , the slope of the power law has been decreasing steadily over time and appears to be converging on precisely the value that Clauset and Young found for global -LRB- non-G8 -RRB- terrorism . 
The Colombian `` war '' may have started out as something unique , but it seems now to have mutated into a conflict with the fingerprint of terrorism . 
And the team found the same trend for the statistics in Iraq since the coalition invasion in March , 2003 . 
Here , the slope of the power law initially had much the same value as that seen by Richardson for conventional wars . 
But it has crept up steadily since 2003 , and now it , too , is equal to that for global terrorism . 
Johnson argues that , while the conventional approach of political analysts is to look for micro-explanations of the course of a conflict in terms of the motivations of the groups concerned , that statistical analysis suggests that the outcomes are much more to do with `` the mechanics of how people now do war '' . 
`` It 's like looking at different markets , '' he says . 
`` We now know that a lot of the fluctuations are universal , irrespective of whether you 're looking at trading in New York or Shanghai . '' 
With that in mind , he and his colleagues have developed a simple mathematical model of how insurgent forces are organised into small groups that are continually coalescing and fragmenting . 
Assuming that the destructive capacity of a group depends on its size and resources , this model predicts the value of the power-law slope found for global terrorism . 
The team 's conclusion supports the assertion of Mary Kaldor , a political scientist at the London School of Economics , that `` the ongoing war in Iraq is a new type of war '' . 
Kaldor says that US military action in Iraq has been predicated on the assumption that they are fighting an `` old war '' . 
`` This is immensely dangerous , '' Kaldor says . 
That , it seems , must also be the message for any global `` war on terror '' - it is not one that can be won by military might , but by new strategies . 
In `` new wars '' , says Kaldor , military forces should be deployed for law enforcement , and `` forces are needed that combine soldiers , police and civilians with the capacity to undertake humanitarian and legal activities '' . 
But if , as Johnson 's work suggests , these conflicts have indeed turned into a form of terrorism , they will not be over soon . 
According to Clauset , the power-law statistics of terrorism show that it `` is an endemic feature of the modern world and is likely not something that can be completely eradicated . 
Instead , it should be considered in a similar way to other endemic problems , such as crime and natural disasters . '' 
From old wars to new wars and global terrorism N Johnson et al. .

2005-08-05,"Commanders weigh their options as ` Juba ' notches up more kills Friday 5 August 2005 00.01 BST They have never seen Juba . 
They hear him , but by then it 's too late : a shot rings out and another US soldier slumps dead or wounded . 
There is never a follow-up shot , never a chance for US forces to identify the origin , to make the hunter the hunted . 
He fires once and vanishes . 
Juba is the nickname given by American forces to an insurgent sniper operating in southern Baghdad . 
They do not know his appearance , nationality or real name , but they know and fear his skill . 
`` He 's good , '' said Specialist Travis Burress , 22 , a sniper with the 1-64 battalion based in Camp Rustamiyah . 
`` Every time we dismount I 'm sure everyone has got him in the back of their minds . 
He 's a serious threat to us . '' 
Gun attacks occasionally pepper the battalion 's foot and mounted patrols , but the single crack of what is thought to be a Tobuk sniper rifle inspires particular dread . 
Since February , the killing of at least two members of the battalion and the wounding of six more have been attributed to Juba . 
Some think it is also he that has picked off up to a dozen other soldiers . 
In a war marked by sectarian bombings and civilian casualties , Juba is unusual in targeting only coalition troops , a difficult quarry protected by armored vehicles , body armor and helmets . 
He waits for soldiers to dismount , or stand up in a Humvee turret , and aims for gaps in their body armor , the lower spine , ribs or above the chest . 
He has killed from 200 metres away . 
`` It was the perfect shot , '' the battalion commander , Lt Col Kevin Farrell , said of one incident . 
`` Blew out the spine . 
`` We have different techniques to try to lure him out , but he is very well trained and very patient . 
He does n't fire a second shot . '' 
Some in the battalion want marksmen to occupy rooftops overlooking supply routes , Juba 's hunting ground , to try to put him in the cross-hairs . 
`` It would be a pretty shitty assignment because he 's good , '' said Spc Burress . 
`` I think it 's a sniper 's job to get a sniper , and it 'd probably take all of us to get him . '' 
American snipers operate in teams of at least two people , a shooter and a spotter , the latter requiring more experience since he must use complicated formulae to calculate factors such as wind strength and drag coefficients . 
Some worry that Juba is on his way to becoming a resistance hero , acclaimed by those Iraqis who distinguish between `` good '' insurgents , who target only Americans , and `` bad '' insurgents who harm civilians . 
The insurgent grapevine celebrates an incident last June when a four-strong marine scout sniper team was killed in Ramadi , all with shots to the head . 
Unlike their opponents , US snipers in Baghdad seldom get to shoot . 
Typically they hide on rooftops and use thermal imaging and night vision equipment to monitor areas . 
If there is suspicious activity , they summon aircraft or ground patrols . 
`` We are professionals . 
There is a line between a maniac with a gun and a sniper , '' said Mike , 31 , a corporal with a reconnaissance sniper platoon who did not want to his surname to be used . 
He spoke during a 24-hour mission on a roof during which his team ate junk food and urinated into a bottle . 
During daylight they lay on the ground , immobile , to avoid being seen . 
`` It 's not a glamorous life , '' he said . 
There was no sign of Juba , who tended to operate further east , but the team spotted mortar flashes and fed the coordinates to base . 
Mike said he had shot 14 people in Somalia , three in Afghanistan and one in Iraq . 
`` It 's not like you expect it to be , an emotional high . 
You just think about the wind , the range , then it 's over with . '' 
Sniper fire is only of the threats for an American military that has suffered heavy losses this week . 
Yesterday another soldier was killed in Ramadi , west of Baghdad , adding to the 21 who died in attacks on Monday and Wednesday . 
Roadside bombs account for most of the lives lost , and the size and design of the explosions has led investigators to conclude that the insurgents are learning bombmaking methods from other terrorist organizations . 
Yesterday 's New York Times reported that the techniques used by Hezbollah in Lebanon were increasingly being seen in roadside bombs in Iraq . 
An unnamed senior American commander quoted by the paper said bombs using shaped charges closely matched the bombs that Hezbollah used against Israel . 
`` Our assessment is that they are probably going off to ` school ' to learn how to make bombs that can destroy armored vehicles , '' he said .

2005-08-06,"Saturday 6 August 2005 20.18 BST The former foreign secretary Robin Cook has died after collapsing on a mountain in Scotland , Scottish police have announced . 
Mr Cook had apparently collapsed with a suspected heart attack on the mountainside while out walking during his summer holidays . 
He was also reported to have seriously injured himself in a fall after his collapse . 
The father-of-two grown up sons was on the mountain for nearly half an hour before rescue services reached him . 
Then , guided by medical experts via telephone , they battled to revive him using cardio pulmonary resuscitation equipment , before he was airlifted by helicopter to hospital in Inverness . 
Mr Cook arrived at hospital at 4pm - some 90 minutes after his collapse and was declared dead five minutes later , said a spokesman for NHS Highland . 
But it was more than three hours later before police confirmed his death . 
A police spokesman added : `` As is normal in such circumstances , a report will be prepared for the Procurator Fiscal . '' 
Prime minister Tony Blair described Mr Cook as `` an outstanding , extraordinary talent '' . 
In a statement released by 10 Downing Street , Mr Blair said : `` Our thoughts and prayers are with Gaynor and all Robin 's family . 
`` This news will be received with immense sadness , not just in Britain but in many parts of the world . 
`` Robin was an outstanding , extraordinary talent - brilliant , incisive in debate , of incredible skill and persuasive power . '' 
Mr Cook was a keen hill-walker , who regularly spent his summer holidays with close family and friends enjoying the dramatic mountain scenery of Highland Scotland , rather than going abroad . 
A leading figure in the Labor party for decades , Mr Cook was put in the key job of foreign secretary when the party won power in 1997 . 
He was demoted to the post of leader of the Commons following Labor 's second election victory in 2001 and resigned from the cabinet in protest at the Iraq war in 2003 . 
He then became one of the sharpest critics of the government 's foreign policy in Iraq . 
Mr Cook 's devotion to enhancing the role of parliament as leader of the Commons made him a popular figure among backbench MPs , and his powerful resignation speech on the eve of war won him great respect from opponents of military action . 
"
2005-08-07,"This is an extract from Robin Cook 's resignation speech to the House of Commons , 17 March 2003 . 
It electrified Parliament and will be remembered as one of the most important addresses in modern Westminster history . 
This is the first time for 20 years that I have addressed the House from the back benches . 
I must confess that I had forgotten how much better the view is from here . 
I have chosen to address the House first on why I can not support a war without international agreement or domestic support . 
The present Prime Minister is the most successful leader of the Labor Party in my lifetime . 
I applaud the heroic efforts that the Prime Minister has made in trying to secure a second resolution -LRB- at the United Nations -RRB- . 
I do not think that anybody could have done better than the Foreign Secretary in working to get support for a second resolution within the Security Council . 
But the very intensity of those attempts underlines how important it was to succeed . 
Now that those attempts have failed , we can not pretend that getting a second resolution was of no importance . 
The reality is that Britain is being asked to embark on a war without agreement in any of the international bodies of which we are a leading partner - not Nato , not the European Union and , now , not the Security Council . 
Only a year ago , we and the United States were part of a coalition against terrorism that was wider and more diverse than I would ever have imagined possible . 
History will be astonished at the diplomatic miscalculations that led so quickly to the disintegration of that powerful coalition . 
Our interests are best protected not by unilateral action but by multilateral agreement and a world order governed by rules . 
Yet tonight the international partnerships most important to us are weakened : the European Union is divided ; the Security Council is in stalemate . 
Those are heavy casualties of a war in which a shot has yet to be fired . 
I have heard some parallels between military action in these circumstances and the military action that we took in Kosovo . 
There was no doubt about the multilateral support that we had for the action that we took in Kosovo . 
It was supported by Nato ; it was supported by the European Union ; it was supported by every single one of the seven neighbors in the region . 
France and Germany were our active allies . 
It is precisely because we have none of that support in this case that it was all the more important to get agreement in the Security Council as the last hope of demonstrating international agreement . 
Our difficulty in getting support this time is that neither the international community nor the British public is persuaded that there is an urgent and compelling reason for this military action in Iraq . 
None of us can predict the death toll of civilians from the forthcoming bombardment of Iraq , but the US warning of a bombing campaign that will ` shock and awe ' makes it likely that casualties will be numbered at least in the thousands . 
For four years as Foreign Secretary I was partly responsible for the western strategy of containment . 
Over the past decade that strategy destroyed more weapons than in the Gulf war , dismantled Iraq 's nuclear weapons program and halted Saddam 's medium and long-range missiles programs . 
Iraq 's military strength is now less than half its size than at the time of the last Gulf war . 
Some advocates of conflict claim that Saddam 's forces are so weak , so demoralised and so badly equipped that the war will be over in a few days . 
We can not base our military strategy on the assumption that Saddam is weak and at the same time justify pre-emptive action on the claim that he is a threat . 
Iraq probably has no weapons of mass destruction in the commonly understood sense of the term - namely a credible device capable of being delivered against a strategic city target . 
Why is it now so urgent that we should take military action to disarm a military capacity that has been there for 20 years , and which we helped to create ? 
It has been a favorite theme of commentators that this House no longer occupies a central role in British politics . 
Nothing could better demonstrate that they are wrong than for this House to stop the commitment of troops in a war that has neither international agreement nor domestic support . 
I intend to join those tomorrow night who will vote against military action now . 
It is for that reason , and for that reason alone , and with a heavy heart , that I resign from the government .

2005-08-07,"Westminster mourns sudden death of leading Labor firebrand and orator Wife at 59-year-old MP 's side after failed resuscitation on Scottish hillside Robin Cook , the former Foreign Secretary , died in hospital last night after collapsing while walking in the Scottish hills he loved . 
The 59-year-old MP was airlifted to hospital in Inverness yesterday afternoon after being taken ill while walking with his wife , Gaynor , and friends near the summit of Ben Stack , close to Lochinver , Sutherland . 
There were unconfirmed reports last night that he suffered a heart attack and then fell , breaking his neck . 
An unnamed friend who was with the MP on the mountain attempted to give Cook mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for 30 minutes before an Coastguard helicopter arrived at the scene . 
The helicopter 's crew continued efforts to revive Cook on the journey to Raigmore hospital where he was pronounced dead at 4.05 pm , shortly after arrival . 
Cook , who also leaves two sons , Christopher and Peter , was a dominant intellectual force in New Labor . 
He sealed his reputation for political integrity with his resignation from the cabinet on the eve of the Iraq war . 
His death last night left colleagues in shock , eliciting tributes from across the political spectrum to the man whom John Prescott , the Deputy Prime Minister , described as ` the greatest parliamentarian of his generation ' . 
Prime Minister Tony Blair was also quick to pay tribute . 
` Robin was an outstanding , extraordinary talent - brilliant , incisive in debate , of incredible skill and persuasive power , ' he said . 
` His contribution to the politics of Britain was hugely significant . 
His contribution to the Labor Party was immense . 
He will be missed and mourned by all of us . ' 
Ironically , friends said Cook had never appeared healthier and happier since leaving office : he was a keen outdoorsman who kept fit by riding and walking . 
Gordon Brown , the Chancellor , who had known Cook since they were university students , said his thoughts were with Gaynor and the family . 
` With his death so sudden and unexpected , the tragic loss to his family , his constituency , our party and our country is all the greater and is most keenly felt by all of us who knew him and will now miss him greatly , ' Brown said last night . 
` Robin 's mastery of the Commons was acknowledged on all sides and his incisive mind , forensic skills and formidable and wide-ranging debating prowess were seen by the public very clearly when , in opposition , he led the response to the Scott inquiry . ' 
In an age of image-conscious politicians , the diminutive , ginger-bearded Cook did not cut a fashionable figure , but his fiercely burning intellect propelled him to the heights of the New Labor firmament , earning the respect even of his foes . 
He was admired by his civil servants for the apparently effortless speed with which he mastered his briefs and his constant hunger for ideas , but he was also a cultured man , as happy to discuss Victorian novelists as the season 's racing form . 
Despite forging a career on the back benches as a quietly devastating critic of foreign policy , tribal loyalty saw him return to the fold to campaign for Tony Blair 's re-election in May . 
Occasionally given to prickliness , Cook was not always an easy man , but his dry wit and sense of mischief endeared him to friends . 
He spoke movingly of how marriage to his second wife , his former secretary Gaynor Regan , had changed him , teaching him 'em otional intelligence ' and giving him an ability to relate to others ' feelings . 
Born in Bellshill in February 1946 , Robin Cook went to school in Aberdeen and Edinburgh before going on to read English literature at Edinburgh University - where he met his first wife , Margaret , a consultant hematologist . 
He became an MP in 1974 , rising swiftly through the opposition ranks , and when Labor gained power in 1997 , was appointed Foreign Secretary , devising the ethical foreign policy that crystallised the optimism of the early New Labor years . 
His proudest achievement in office , he said , was when Britain intervened to halt ethnic cleansing in Kosovo . 
After the 2001 general election , he was moved abruptly sideways to Leader of the Commons , a job he did not initially want but which became a showcase for his wit - and his tenacious pursuit of House of Lords reform . 
` It 's hard to think of anyone who matched him over the dispatch box - he had such a formidable mind , ' said Stephen Twigg , his deputy during those years . 
In the rare moments that he relaxed , however , Cook could be great company . 
` He was hugely funny . 
I remember we had a Christmas night out - it ended up being in about February . 
He took us all to a jazz club in Camden ; he loved jazz , ' Twigg added . 
Denis MacShane , the former Europe minister who also worked closely with Cook , said his thoughts were with Cook 's wife and family . 
` Robin has illuminated British politics , and especially those of the democratic left , for more than 30 years , ' he said . 
` Even half an insight from Robin was worth 10 speeches from most politicians . ' 
Local emergency services started to receive reports just after 2.30 pm yesterday that the Livingston MP had collapsed near the summit of Ben Stack , 2,365 ft above sea level . 
As Cook 's friends waited for the Coastguard helicopter to arrive , they were given guidance on resuscitation techniques by medical experts via telephone . 
The helicopter 's crew then battled to revive him using cardio-pulmonary resuscitation equipment , before airlifting the unconscious politician to Raigmore hospital . 
Cook 's wife was rushed by police car to the hospital where she watched as doctors unsuccessfully attempted to save his life . 
Cook was a keen hill-walker , and regularly spent his summer holidays with close family and friends enjoying the dramatic mountain scenery of Highland Scotland , rather than going abroad . 
The announcement of his death was delayed for three hours as police contacted relatives . 
Last night , friends of Cook said his demise had left a huge gap in British politics . 
` His death leaves a gaping hole in the leadership of the Labor movement . ' 
said Tony Woodley , general secretary of the Transport and General Workers ' Union . 
` He was a socialist and an internationalist of principle and we are all left poorer by his passing , ' . 
Former deputy Labor leader Roy Hattersley said Cook 's death would be felt keenly in the House of Commons . ' 
I do n't think there has been any parliamentarian of my time who has made more significant speeches , ' Hattersley said . 
"
2005-08-07,"The liberals who say I have deserted the left should ask themselves where they stand on Islamism Looking back on how his generation covered up the crimes of communism in the 1930s , WH Auden explained that he and his friends were n't true communists but fellow travellers . 
At home they defended civil liberties and stood up for freedom of speech . 
Abroad , they tolerated atrocities precisely because they did n't impinge on them . 
` Our great error , ' said Auden , ` was not a false admiration for Russia but a snobbish feeling that nothing which happened in a semi-barbarous country which had experienced neither the Renaissance nor the Enlightenment could be of any importance : had any of the countries we knew personally , like France , Germany or Italy , the language of which we could speak and where we had personal friends , been one to have a successful communist revolution with the same phenomena of terror , purges , censorship etc , we would have screamed our heads off . ' 
To speak of the ` Auden generation ' is to perpetuate a myth of the Thirties . 
The majority of the population , including the majority of Labor supporters , never read an Auden poem or hitched a ride with communism . 
What is meant is the ` progressive ' middle-class left : publishers , authors , academics , teachers , liberal journalists , the odd lawyer and odder advocate of various forms of alternative life styles . 
People like me , in short . 
In their later years , most tried a defense which Auden was too honest , and too filled with disgust at his younger self , to advance . 
Our priority was fighting fascism , the excuse-making ran . 
We were faced with a psychopathic movement of the extreme right which was dripping in blood . 
It looks bad now that we went along with Stalin , but we were socialists and he called what he was doing socialism , and in any event we had other priorities . 
Today 's middle-class left is made up of the same types as 70 years ago . 
The faults of small-mindedness and self-righteousness and the virtues of instinctive suspicion of the British establishment and sympathy for the British underdog have n't changed either . 
What 's new is that no one truly believes in socialism . 
When Tony Blair goes we will have the first Labor leadership election without a serious left-wing candidate . 
Indeed , it is impossible to imagine what a serious left-wing candidate would look like and what his or her program might be . 
I 'm sure that any halfway competent political philosopher could rip the assumptions of modern middle-class left-wingery apart . 
Why is it right to support a free market in sexual relationships but oppose free-market economics , for instance ? 
But his criticisms would have little impact . 
It 's like a religion : the contradictions are obvious to outsiders but do n't disturb the faithful . 
You believe when you 're in its warm embrace . 
Alas , I 'm out . 
Last week , after 44 years of regular church-going , the bell tolled , the book was closed and the candle was extinguished . 
The officiating bishop was Peter Wilby , a former editor of the New Statesman and a friend of long-standing , who delivered his anathema in the Guardian . 
The immediate heresy was a piece I 'd written about how difficult the courts made it to deport suspected Islamist terrorists . 
As I 'd campaigned to protect asylum seekers in the past , Wilby used the article as damning evidence of ' a rightwards lurch ' . 
The old bat did n't understand that genuine asylum seekers are the victims of the world 's greatest criminals - four million fled Saddam Hussein - not criminals themselves . 
Even if he 'd grasped that the Mail was wrong and real refugees were n't villains , I doubt it would have made a difference . 
My mortal sin had been to question ` harshly the motives of the anti-war movement ' , and to that I had to plead guilty . 
The least attractive characteristic of the middle-class left - one shared with the Thatcherites - is its refusal to accept that its opponents are sincere . 
The legacy of Marx and Freud allows it to dismiss criticisms as masks which hide corruption , class interests , racism , sexism - any motive can be implied except fundamental differences of principle . 
Wilby went through a long list of what could have motivated mine and similar ` betrayals ' . 
Perhaps we became right wing as we got older . 
Perhaps we wanted to stick our snouts into the deep troughs of the Tory press . 
Perhaps taking out a mortgage committed us to the capitalist system or having children encouraged petit bourgeois individualism of the most anti-social kind . 
Generously in light of the above charge sheet , he plumped for the conclusion that our restless minds just got bored with the ` straitjacket ' of left-wing thought . 
We left the slog of building a better world to the decent plodders . 
Generous to me , and over-generous to allegedly left-wing thought . 
What he and a large part of the mainstream liberal-left do n't and wo n't confront is that they have become the fellow travellers of the psychopathic far-right . 
Many emotions have been stirred by the grisly spectacle - anger , scorn and incredulity among them - but boredom , no , never boredom . 
As in the 1930s , there 's little doubt that few apart from George Galloway and others in the gruesome leadership of the anti-war movement were keen on saluting Saddam Hussein . 
The reason why one million people marched through London without one mounting a platform to express solidarity with the victims of fascism was that it never occurred to them that there were people in Iraq who shared their values . 
It felt like nit-picking to point this out at the time . 
Wars are usually worth opposing , especially capricious wars advocated by a slippery Prime Minister in alliance with a repellent US President . 
But arguments have their own dynamic . 
If you start by refusing to look Baathism or Islamism in the face , the logic of blaming everything on Tony Blair and George W Bush pushes you into making ever more excuses for the extreme right . 
Auden noticed a retreat from universal principles in the 1930s - communism was fine in ` semi-barbaric ' Russia but would have been a screaming outrage in a civilised country . 
He should have been alive today . 
With no socialism to provide international solidarity , good motives of tolerance and respect for other cultures have had the unintended consequence of leading a large part of post-modern liberal opinion into the position of 19th-century imperialists . 
It is presumptuous and oppressive to suggest that other cultures want the liberties we take for granted , their argument runs . 
So it may be , but believe that and the upshot is that democracy , feminism and human rights become good for whites but not for browns and brown-skinned people who contradict you are the tools of the neo-conservatives . 
On the other hand when confronted with a movement of contemporary imperialism - Islamism wants an empire from the Philippines to Gibraltar - and which is tyrannical , homophobic , misogynist , racist and homicidal to boot , they feel it is valid because it is against Western culture . 
It expresses its feelings in a regrettably brutal manner perhaps , but that ca n't hide its authenticity . 
The result of this inversion of principles has been that liberals ca n't form alliances with the victims of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan or Iraq any more than the Auden generation could form alliances with the victims of Stalinism . 
This is n't simply about international relations . 
Who is going to help the victims of religious intolerance in Britain 's immigrant communities ? 
Not the Liberal Democrats , who have never once offered support to liberal and democrats in Iraq . 
Nor an anti-war left which prefers to embrace a Muslim Association of Britain and Yusuf al-Qaradawi who believe that Muslims who freely decide to change their religion or renounce religion should be executed . 
If the Archbishop of Canterbury were to suggest the same treatment for renegade Christians all hell would break loose . 
But as the bigotry comes from ` the other ' there is silence . 
Perhaps it will break soon . 
There always was far more disquiet on the left at this ` rightwards lurch ' than the Guardian or Radio 4 admitted . 
If my emails are a guide , the London bombs have added a practical reason for breaking with the consensus : now they 're trying to kill us . 
Even if people think that the Iraq war has made Britain a bigger target , they are still confronted with a fascistic cult of murder and self-murder which allows no compromise . 
The thing to watch for with fellow travellers is what shocks them into pulling the emergency cord and jumping off the train . 
I know some will stay on to the terminus , and when the man with the rucksack explodes his bomb their dying words will be : ` It 's not your fault . 
I blame Tony Blair . ' 
My advice to my former comrades is to struggle out of your straitjackets and get off at the next station . 
It would be good to see you on this side of the barrier . 
"
2005-08-08,"Monday 8 August 2005 00.05 BST In the early hours of May 2 1997 Robin Cook made the short journey from his constituency count to Edinburgh airport . 
He was due to join Tony Blair and Labor 's leading lights at the Festival Hall to celebrate the party 's return from the wilderness after 18 years . 
But the man who was to be foreign secretary was depressed . 
His agent and his local fixer both asked him why he seemed so glum . 
Earlier that evening Cook had told his wife Margaret over dinner that he feared government might bring out the worst in those he knew . 
A few weeks earlier I had gone to see Cook in his Commons office to tell him I was planning to write his biography . 
I told him I would rather he would cooperate , but it was not essential - I would do it anyway . 
He said he would help on the politics , but not `` the other stuff '' . 
I got to know him well in those early years of government ; not as well as some , and not as well as I might have liked . 
Cook was alternately warm and offhand , intellectually impressive but strangely lacking in strategic sense . 
He knew he was capable of terrible put-downs , and wished it otherwise . 
He knew he should have made shrewder alliances , but did not seem to care enough to change . 
And yet , for all his personal foibles , he did more than perhaps any single politician of his generation to restore faith in the profession . 
He was a man of deep conviction , a man who would compromise only under duress . 
An evening with him - copiously supplied with malt whisky - was always invigorating . 
Conversation with him was intellectually stimulating . 
I know precious few among his profession who on that score come close . 
There was something about Cook that unnerved lesser minds . 
There was something about him that unnerved those of similar minds . 
His feud with Gordon Brown will go down as one of the great lost opportunities of progressive politics . 
Two men of similar backgrounds - son of teacher , son of preacher , both making their mark in Edinburgh politics - could have forged a potent alliance . 
At first they did work together , co-editing a book in 1974 , the year Cook , the older and senior figure , first entered parliament . 
Nobody can quite tell - not even the protagonists - exactly when and why their relationship turned sour . 
The one incident that several people point to is the launch of their second pamphlet in 1983 when , with Brown still on his way to the meeting , Cook started it early , giving the impression it was all his idea . 
Cook was slower than Brown to adapt to the strictures of New Labor . 
He resented the spin tactics that began to take hold in the early 1990s -LRB- although in government he retained a curious respect for Alastair Campbell -RRB- . 
On policy , he was slower than others to shed old certainties such as state ownership , unilateral nuclear disarmament and hostility to the European Community . 
Paradoxically , given everything that was to follow , Cook resented Blair for giving him the foreign affairs portfolio in 1994 . 
He held Brown responsible for that - and he was not wrong . 
He was frozen out of the important discussions on economic affairs . 
As he mustered enthusiasm for the new job , Cook saw an opportunity to forge a radical foreign policy , breaking with the cynicism of the Tory years that had led to a surge in weapons sales and dodgy trade deals masquerading as international development . 
His single-handed destruction of the Major government over the arms-to-Iraq scandal in 1996 has been attributed to his forensic skill . 
But there was passion and raw anger too . 
When , a few weeks into office , he declared a new `` ethical dimension '' to his foreign policy , he accepted he would be mocked by the opposition and parts of the press . 
He was bitterly upset , but not surprised , when Blair was so contemptuous of measures such as a tightening of the rules on arms sales . 
Cook lost what political independence he had the moment his marriage broke up so publicly . 
He became dependent on the Blair machine for his survival . 
After a turbulent first year he performed with increasing professionalism , handling prewar negotiations on Kosovo with aplomb . 
He became an increasingly respected figure in the EU . 
He performed a 180-degree turn , becoming a proselytiser for the European cause . 
But the ease with which Blair dispensed with his services in 2001 demonstrated the shallowness of Cook 's political base . 
It has become a commonplace to portray Cook 's opposition to the war on Iraq as one of great principle . 
It was , but it was also rooted in pragmatism . 
While still in the cabinet he insisted on being briefed on the latest intelligence . 
Cook suggested to me that he possibly would have gone along with the war if the evidence had been compelling . 
It was shoddy and the man with the forensic mind could not understand how Blair and those around him had been so hoodwinked . 
Even as he resigned , however , Cook sought to minimize the damage to the government . 
He could have made his departing speech at the start of the crucial debate on Iraq , but allowed himself to be convinced by Campbell not to . 
It is possible his intervention that day could have tilted the balance against Blair . 
Never a man to lightly admit mistakes , I suspect Cook regretted that since . 
I suspect too he regretted not making up earlier with Brown . 
As for Clare Short , why had she and Cook not coordinated their resignations prewar ? 
Neither has a convincing answer . 
He made mistakes , yes , but Cook did his best to stop this government making the biggest mistake of all . 
There seems little justice that he has parted the scene so early , depriving the critics of the Iraq war with their most principled - and practical - voice .

2005-08-08,"` Coruscating debater ' : Robin Cook . 
Photograph : Martin Argles Robin Cook , who has died suddenly at the age of 59 , was one of the cleverest and most creative figures in modern British politics . 
He devoted his entire career to the advancement of the Labor party and the pursuit of radical change within society . 
Cook was one of the very few contemporary politicians whose national reputation was built principally within the chamber of the House of Commons . 
He was a brilliant , coruscating debater whose most devastating performances combined lofty ridicule and forensic analysis in equal measure . 
If Tony Blair was the Labor leader whom the Tories learned to fear in the country , Cook was the Labor frontbencher whom they had long since come to fear and loathe in the Commons . 
Nobody contributed more , during the long years of opposition , to the rebuilding of morale , the restoration of Labor 's credibility as a potential party of government or the shredding of Tory reputations . 
Cook was never much of an organiser on his own behalf , yet regularly topped the shadow cabinet poll of MPs during the opposition years . 
This was an unpleasant process which involved much trading of blocks of votes , and the fact that Cook emerged in prime position simply reflected the fact that no MP with the slightest interest in advancing Labor as an effective opposition would have wished him to be anywhere but in the front line . 
Cook 's intelligence and grasp of issues made him an impressive foreign secretary when Labor won the 1997 election , highly regarded on the international stage . 
However , it was inevitable that declaring the advent of an `` ethical foreign policy '' would invite constant efforts to find fault lines between rhetoric and reality , at the personal level as well as in his approach to issues . 
He did not expect Tony Blair to move him from the job after the 2001 election , and was hurt both by the loss of that high office and the brutality of the execution . 
But he adapted with elan to the relatively mundane post of leader of the house , and it is by no means the least of his epitaphs that he remains the only serious politician who has tried to replace the corrupting system of patronage which underpins the House of Lords with a democratic chamber . 
Cook 's resignation from the cabinet over the second Iraq war in 2003 came at a time when his Lords reforms had run into the prime ministerial buffers . 
Whether he would have taken precisely the same position if he had remained as foreign secretary remains an open question . 
Having decided to go , he did so with characteristic gravitas and style , pointedly declining to cross the line which separates honorable dissent from embittered treachery . 
Cook had good reason to understand the poisonous realities of Saddam Hussein 's Iraq . 
As foreign secretary , he presided over the enforcement of a sanctions regime which was specifically predicated on the need to contain Saddam 's efforts to develop weapons of mass destruction , as well as the enforcement of no-fly zones to limit the risk of renewed aggression . 
It is often forgotten now that much of what became the anti-war lobby was equally opposed to these policies and that Cook was an object of their opprobrium . 
The basis of his opposition to the invasion was that , essentially , nothing had changed and that the threat remained containable . 
In his highly effective resignation speech , Cook asked : `` Why is it now so urgent that we should take military action to disarm a military capacity that has been there for 20 years and which we helped to create ? '' 
He then provided his own answer : `` What has come to trouble me most over the past week is the suspicion that if the hanging chads in Florida had gone the other way and Al Gore had been elected , we would not now be about to commit British troops . '' 
The same hanging chads had transformed the whole international environment and probably contributed to Cook 's departure from the Foreign Office . 
During the Clinton presidency , he was a statesman among friends and enjoyed a particularly warm and productive relationship with Madeleine Albright as US secretary of state . 
But long before the supreme court finally handed George Bush his victory , the need to be in there first and friendliest with the anticipated new administration had become the overriding priority of British foreign policy . 
That was not Cook 's natural instinct . 
Robert Finlayson Cook - known since schooldays as Robin - was born in Bellshill , Lanarkshire , the only child of a schoolteacher who became a headmaster . 
Though his father 's profession took them around Scotland and Robin 's schooling was in Aberdeen , there was a family background in Edinburgh , and it was there that he went to university , graduating with an honors degree in English Literature . 
It was a period of notable turmoil in Edinburgh student politics , and Cook not only participated but observed as features editor of the newspaper Student -LRB- under the editorship of Duncan Campbell , now of the Guardian -RRB- . 
Cook eschewed fashionable ultra leftism and ploughed into student Labor politics . 
He was chairman of the Scottish Association of Labor Students in 1966-67 . 
Although Gordon Brown was several years younger , their careers overlapped from these early days , and so too did a friction which lasted more than 30 years , and only recently looked like being reconciled . 
Its precise origins , certainly by Cook 's own account , remained a mystery to him . 
After university , Cook became a lecturer with the Workers ' Educational Association , which allowed him to deepen his involvement in Edinburgh politics . 
He was secretary of Edinburgh City Labor party from 1970 to 1972 , and became one of Scotland 's youngest councillors when he was elected to Edinburgh Corporation in 1971 at the age of 26 . 
Part of Cook 's strength lay in his widely acknowledged excellence - first as a councillor , and then as a constituency MP . 
He served as chairman of Edinburgh 's housing committee , and was always assiduous in his attention to constituents ' problems . 
This side of his political life may have conflicted with Cook 's national image , the prickly and somewhat aloof character - but the view among those he represented of a very approachable man who genuinely cared about resolving their problems was very much closer to the human reality . 
When Tom Oswald , the long-serving MP for Edinburgh Central , retired at the February 1974 general election , the bright and articulate young Cook was an obvious successor . 
His positions were generally Tribunite , but the dominant issue in Scottish Labor politics during the 1970s defied left-right demarcations - it concerned the constitution , and specifically , how Scotland should respond to the oil-fuelled rise of nationalism . 
Whatever the basis for earlier disagreements with Brown might have been , there is no doubt that their respective positions in the run-up to the 1978 devolution referendum reinforced them . 
Brown had started to build his political reputation as an advocate of devolution . 
Cook was one of its most articulate opponents , and when the Labor Vote No Campaign was founded , he became one of its vice-chairmen . 
The referendum failed to deliver devolution , and was followed the next year by the fall of the Callaghan government when Margaret Thatcher 's Conservatives won the general election . 
By the time of the next election , in 1983 , it was clear that the internal debate on devolution within the Labor party was effectively over . 
As both a pragmatist and a democrat , Cook declared his support for a Scottish parliament in a television studio on election night , and became a convinced advocate of the reform . 
He was also , throughout his career , an unswerving supporter of proportional representation , a doctrine now embraced by the Scottish parliament . 
Like many on the left in the early 1980s , Cook had to face up to the implications of Militant entryism and other threats to the Labor party 's very existence . 
In the wake of boundary changes , he switched from Edinburgh Central to the new Livingston seat in advance of the 1983 election . 
To his astonishment , he found himself opposed for the nomination by Tony Benn , who was at that time looking for a seat . 
Cook prevailed comfortably and became a key player in the Kinnock , Smith and Blair reforms which made Labor electable . 
With each frontbench post that he held in opposition , Cook 's stock rose . 
He singlehandedly destroyed John Moore 's prospects of becoming Tory leader when , as health spokesman between 1987 and 1992 , he repeatedly took him apart in debates . 
Probably his greatest Commons triumph was in the 1996 debate on the Scott Report into arms for Iraq . 
Famously , Cook had only two hours access to the report before delivering the tour de force in which he described the Tory frontbench as `` limpets '' . 
Government is more difficult than opposition , and Cook 's FCO tenure was not short of its excitements . 
His involvement in the ending of Serbian domination of Kosovo in 1999 was seen as successful . 
He was embarrassed by appearing not to have been informed by local diplomats about the Sandline International group of mercenaries in Sierra Leone in 1998 , though ultimately took the view that there , the ends justified the means . 
On the Queen 's visit to Pakistan and India in 1997 , he had to make it clear that , whatever he may have said privately , he had said nothing publicly about British mediation in the Kashmir dispute . 
He gained great , if sometimes grudging , respect from the mandarins , but the challenges that he faced were compounded by the highly publicised upheavals in his private life , culminating in the break-up of his first marriage and his subsequent re-marriage to his former secretary , Gaynor Regan . 
It is a measure of Cook 's competence and prestige , both as a national politician and in his constituency , that he continued to operate effectively and maintain political and public support , in the face of intense and continuing media interest . 
Out of office , Cook expanded his interests beyond politics . 
His devotion to horses extended to all aspects of the equine world and not just his well-advertised love of the turf . 
He wrote widely and well . 
But he had not abandoned hope of a return to frontline politics . 
He was without doubt one of the ablest and most interesting postwar Labor politicians , as well as the most effective parliamentarian of his generation . 
His first wife , Margaret , whom he had married in 1969 , described him as an exemplary father , who because of his capacity for taking a moral stand found opposition easier than government . 
He is survived by two sons , Peter and Christopher , from his first marriage , and by his second wife , Gaynor .

2005-08-12,"Friday 12 August 2005 01.21 BST Shia leaders in Iraq demanded an autonomous region for the Shia-dominated south yesterday , raising the prospect of an oil-rich fiefdom dominated by conservative Muslim clerics . 
The head of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq -LRB- SCITI -RRB- , one of the main ruling parties , called for the creation of a federal southern state in a new national constitution due to be completed this weekend . 
Abdul Aziz al-Hakim used a rally in the Shia holy city of Najaf to make one of the boldest pitches yet for a `` Shiastan '' encompassing the Gulf oilfields and almost half of Iraq 's 26 million population . 
`` Regarding federalism , we think that it is necessary to form one entire region in the south , '' he told tens of thousands of chanting supporters . 
Hadi al-Amery , head of the party 's militia , the Badr Organisation , echoed the call for a Shia version of the autonomy enjoyed by Kurds in the north , declaring : `` Federalism has to be in all of Iraq . '' 
The SCIRI 's cleric leaders have strong ties to Iran 's theocracy and dominate the Shia bloc , which rules in coalition with the largely secular Kurds . 
Some analysts suggested the call for southern autonomy was a negotiating ploy to gain leverage for making Islam the main source of legislation . 
The prospect of autonomy dismayed Sunni Arabs who fear being marginalised in the center of Iraq . 
Secular Shias and women 's rights advocates were more alarmed at the spectre of Islamic sharia law being imposed on a region stretching from Kerbala in the center to Basra in the south . 
Negotiators from Iraq 's main religious and ethnic groups have a deadline to agree a draft constitution by tomorrow , giving parliament until Monday to approve the text and submit it to voters for a referendum on October 15 . 
All sides accept that Kurds will retain the autonomy they have enjoyed since the 1991 Gulf war . 
But the drive to mirror that with autonomy for the south has encountered fierce opposition . 
Sunnis fear that Iraq will disintegrate , or at least fracture , if Shias and Kurds control the oil wells and leave Sunnis with only the `` sands of Anbar '' , a vast , barren province . 
`` We hoped this day would never come , '' said Saleh al-Mutlak , a leading Sunni politician . 
`` We believe that the Arabs , whether Sunni or Shia , are one . 
We totally reject any attempt to stir up sectarian issues to divide Iraq . '' 
Sunnis were a dominant minority under the deposed president , Saddam Hussein , and Sunni militants are driving the insurgency . 
The Shia prime minister , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , is keen to draw them into the political process , and this is one reason he opposes southern autonomy . 
`` The idea of a Shia region is unacceptable to us , '' his spokesman said yesterday . 
After decades of oppression under Saddam , Shia conservatives emerged after the United States-led invasion two years ago to impose Islamic rule on the south , closing alcohol shops , curtailing music and encouraging women to wear headscarves . 
Having swept elections in January , conservatives boast a democratic mandate , but secular Shias and liberals say voters did not call for oppression and intolerance . 
`` We 're against federalism because we are against sharia . 
That is our fear , '' said Ghareba Ghareb of the Iraqi Women 's Association . 
She hoped a centralised Baghdad government would rein in militant clerics . 
US officials have been pushing hard for the constitution deadline to be met , seeing the process as a way to quell the insurgency and reduce foreign troop levels . 
If a draft constitution is agreed and passed in a referendum it will pave the way for elections in December . 
As the deadline looms , negotiators are haggling over whether the Republic of Iraq should be renamed the Federal Republic of Iraq , the Islamic Republic or the Federal Islamic Republic . 
Iraq 's al-Qaida group vowed yesterday to kill anyone involved in drafting the constitution . 
The group , led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , says that sharia law should be the only legislation to govern Iraq .

2005-08-12,"It is not only Iraq that is occupied . 
America is too My country is in the grip of a president surrounded by thugs in suits Friday 12 August 2005 01.21 BST It has quickly become clear that Iraq is not a liberated country , but an occupied country . 
We became familiar with that term during the second world war . 
We talked of German-occupied France , German-occupied Europe . 
And after the war we spoke of Soviet-occupied Hungary , Czechoslovakia , eastern Europe . 
It was the Nazis , the Soviets , who occupied countries . 
The United States liberated them from occupation . 
Now we are the occupiers . 
True , we liberated Iraq from Saddam Hussein , but not from us . 
Just as in 1898 we liberated Cuba from Spain , but not from us . 
Spanish tyranny was overthrown , but the US established a military base in Cuba , as we are doing in Iraq . 
US corporations moved into Cuba , just as Bechtel and Halliburton and the oil corporations are moving into Iraq . 
The US framed and imposed , with support from local accomplices , the constitution that would govern Cuba , just as it has drawn up , with help from local political groups , a constitution for Iraq . 
And it is an ugly occupation . 
On August 7 2003 the New York Times reported that General Sanchez in Baghdad was worried about the Iraqi reaction to occupation . 
Pro-US Iraqi leaders were giving him a message , as he put it : `` When you take a father in front of his family and put a bag over his head and put him on the ground , you have had a significant adverse effect on his dignity and respect in the eyes of his family . '' 
-LRB- That 's very perceptive . -RRB- 
We know that fighting during the US offensive in November 2004 destroyed three-quarters of the town of Falluja -LRB- population 360,000 -RRB- , killing hundreds of its inhabitants . 
The objective of the operation was to cleanse the town of the terrorist bands acting as part of a `` Ba'athist conspiracy '' . 
But we should recall that on June 16 2003 , barely six weeks after President Bush had claimed victory in Iraq , two reporters for the Knight Ridder newspaper group wrote this about the Falluja area : `` In dozens of interviews during the past five days , most residents across the area said there was no Ba'athist or Sunni conspiracy against US soldiers , there were only people ready to fight because their relatives had been hurt or killed , or they themselves had been humiliated by home searches and road stops ... One woman said , after her husband was taken from their home because of empty wooden crates which they had bought for firewood , that the US is guilty of terrorism . '' 
Soldiers who are set down in a country where they were told they would be welcomed as liberators and find they are surrounded by a hostile population become fearful and trigger-happy . 
On March 4 nervous , frightened GIs manning a roadblock fired on the Italian journalist Giuliana Sgrena , just released by kidnappers , and an intelligence service officer , Nicola Calipari , whom they killed . 
We have all read reports of US soldiers angry at being kept in Iraq . 
Such sentiments are becoming known to the US public , as are the feelings of many deserters who are refusing to return to Iraq after home leave . 
In May 2003 a Gallup poll reported that only 13 % of the US public thought the war was going badly . 
According to a poll published by the New York Times and CBS News on June 17 , 51 % now think the US should not have invaded Iraq or become involved in the war . 
Some 59 % disapprove of Bush 's handling of the situation . 
But more ominous , perhaps , than the occupation of Iraq is the occupation of the US . 
I wake up in the morning , read the newspaper , and feel that we are an occupied country , that some alien group has taken over . 
I wake up thinking : the US is in the grip of a president surrounded by thugs in suits who care nothing about human life abroad or here , who care nothing about freedom abroad or here , who care nothing about what happens to the earth , the water or the air , or what kind of world will be inherited by our children and grandchildren . 
More Americans are beginning to feel , like the soldiers in Iraq , that something is terribly wrong . 
More and more every day the lies are being exposed . 
And then there is the largest lie , that everything the US does is to be pardoned because we are engaged in a `` war on terrorism '' , ignoring the fact that war is itself terrorism , that barging into homes and taking away people and subjecting them to torture is terrorism , that invading and bombing other countries does not give us more security but less . 
The Bush administration , unable to capture the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks , invaded Afghanistan , killing thousands of people and driving hundreds of thousands from their homes . 
Yet it still does not know where the criminals are . 
Not knowing what weapons Saddam Hussein was hiding , it invaded and bombed Iraq in March 2003 , disregarding the UN , killing thousands of civilians and soldiers and terrorising the population ; and not knowing who was and was not a terrorist , the US government confined hundreds of people in Guant namo under such conditions that 18 have tried to commit suicide . 
The Amnesty International Report 2005 notes : `` Guant namo Bay has become the gulag of our times ... When the most powerful country in the world thumbs its nose at the rule of law and human rights , it grants a licence to others to commit abuse with impunity '' . 
The `` war on terrorism '' is not only a war on innocent people in other countries ; it is a war on the people of the US : on our liberties , on our standard of living . 
The country 's wealth is being stolen from the people and handed over to the super-rich . 
The lives of the young are being stolen . 
The Iraq war will undoubtedly claim many more victims , not only abroad but also on US territory . 
The Bush administration maintains that , unlike the Vietnam war , this conflict is not causing many casualties . 
True enough , fewer than 2,000 service men and women have lost their lives in the fighting . 
But when the war finally ends , the number of its indirect victims , through disease or mental disorders , will increase steadily . 
After the Vietnam war , veterans reported congenital malformations in their children , caused by Agent Orange . 
Officially there were only a few hundred losses in the Gulf war of 1991 , but the US Gulf War Veterans Association has reported 8,000 deaths in the past 10 years . 
Some 200,000 veterans , out of 600,000 who took part , have registered a range of complaints due to the weapons and munitions used in combat . 
We have yet to see the long-term effects of depleted uranium on those currently stationed in Iraq . 
Our faith is that human beings only support violence and terror when they have been lied to . 
And when they learn the truth , as happened in the course of the Vietnam war , they will turn against the government . 
We have the support of the rest of the world . 
The US can not indefinitely ignore the 10 million people who protested around the world on February 15 2003 . 
There is no act too small , no act too bold . 
The history of social change is the history of millions of actions , small and large , coming together at points in history and creating a power that governments can not suppress .

2005-08-15,"How Bush would gain from war with Iran The US has the capability and reasons for an assault - and it is hard to see Britain uninvolved Monday 15 August 2005 00.03 BST President Bush has reminded us that he is prepared to take military action to prevent Iran acquiring nuclear weapons . 
On Israeli television this weekend , he declared that `` all options are on the table '' if Tehran does n't comply with international demands . 
In private his officials deride EU and UN diplomacy with Iran . 
US officials have been preparing pre-emptive war since Bush marked Iran out as a member of the `` axis of evil '' back in 2002 . 
Once again , this war is likely to have British support . 
A plausible spin could be that America and Britain must act where the international community has failed , and that their action is the responsible alternative to an Israeli attack . 
The conventional wisdom is that , even if diplomacy fails , the US is so bogged down in Iraq that it could not take on Iran . 
However , this misunderstands the capabilities and intentions of the Bush administration . 
America 's devastating air power is not committed in Iraq . 
Just 120 B52 , B1 and B2 bombers could hit 5,000 targets in a single mission . 
Thousands of other warplanes and missiles are available . 
The army and marines are heavily committed in Iraq , but enough forces could be found to secure coastal oilfields and to conduct raids into Iran . 
A US attack is unlikely to be confined to the suspected WMD locations or to involve a ground invasion to occupy the country . 
The strikes would probably be intended to destroy military , political and -LRB- oil excepted -RRB- economic infrastructure . 
A disabled Iran could be further paralysed by civil war . 
Tehran alleges US support for separatists in the large Azeri population of the north-west , and fighting is increasing in Iranian Kurdistan . 
The possible negative consequences of an attack on Iran are well known : an increase in terrorism ; a Shia rising in Iraq ; Hizbullah and Iranian attacks on Israel ; attacks on oil facilities along the Gulf and a recession caused by rising oil prices . 
Advocates of war argue that if Iran is allowed to go nuclear then each of these threats to US and Israeli interests becomes far greater . 
In this logic , any negative consequence becomes a further reason to attack now - with Iran disabled all these threats can , it is argued , be reduced . 
Iraq is proving an electoral liability . 
This is a threat to the Bush team 's intention to retain power for the next decade - perhaps , as the author Bob Woodward says , with President Cheney at the helm . 
War with Iran next spring can enable them to win the mid-term elections and retain control of the Republican party , now in partial rebellion over Iraq . 
The rise in oil prices and subsequent recession are reasons some doubt that an attack would take place . 
However , Iran 's supplies are destined for China - perceived as the US 's main long-term rival . 
And the Bush team are experienced enough to remember that Ronald Reagan rode out the recession of the early 1980s on a wave of rhetoric about `` evil empire '' . 
Even if the US went ahead , runs the argument , Britain would not be involved as Tony Blair would not want a rerun of the Iraq controversy . 
But British forces are already in the area : they border Iran around Basra , and will soon lead the Nato force on Iran 's Afghan frontier . 
The British island of Diego Garcia is a critical US base . 
It is hard to see Britain uninvolved in US actions . 
The prime minister is clearly of a mind to no more countenance Iran 's WMD than he did Iraq 's . 
In Iran 's case the evidence is more substantial . 
The Iranians do have a nuclear energy program and have lied about it . 
In any event , Blair is probably aware that the US is unlikely to supply him with the prized successor to the Trident submarine if Britain refuses to continue to pay the blood sacrifice of standing with the US . 
Tory votes might provide sufficient `` national unity '' to see off Labor dissenters . 
New approaches are needed to head off such a dismal scenario . 
The problem on WMD is that Blair and Bush are doing too little , not too much . 
Why pick on Iran rather than India , Pakistan , Israel or Egypt - not to mention the west 's weapons ? 
In the era of Gorbachev and Reagan , political will created treaties that still successfully control many types of WMD . 
Revived , they would provide the basis for global controls . 
Iran must not be dealt with in isolation . 
As the Iran debate unfolds , we will no doubt again hear about the joint intelligence committee . 
We should follow the advice of a former head of the committee , Sir Paul Lever , to remove US intelligence officials from around the JIC table , where they normally sit . 
Only in this way , argues Lever , can the British take a considered view themselves . 
We need to be clear that our MPs have no mandate to support an attack on Iran . 
During the election campaign , the government dismissed any suggestion that Iran might be attacked as ridiculous scaremongering . 
If Blair has told Bush that Britain will prevent Iran 's nuclear weapons `` come what may '' , we need to be equally clear that nothing short of an election would provide the mandate for an attack .

2005-08-15,"Followers split as 95-year-old guru ends meditation teaching in ` scorpion nation ' Monday 15 August 2005 13.08 BST You can do it in peace-loving nations such as Ireland and Holland . 
And , despite its record in Vietnam and Iraq , you can still do it in the United States . 
But try meditating for a more enlightened Britain and you could find yourself accused of feeding `` the destroyer of the world . '' 
Nearly 40 years after he first turned the Beatles on to transcendental meditation at his Indian ashram - sparking an upsurge of interest in his philosophy across the world - the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi has ordered his followers to stop teaching his advanced meditation and levitation techniques in Britain . 
Disgusted at Tony Blair 's support for the US in the Iraq war and the British electorate 's failure to unseat the prime minister at the general election , the 95-year-old guru says there is no point continuing to waste the `` beautiful nectar '' of TM on a `` scorpion '' nation . 
`` The good effects of transcendental meditation - increased creativity and long life - should not be given to a dangerous country that is constantly busy destroying the world , '' said the maharishi , speaking at one his regular press conferences in the Netherlands . 
`` TM is a gift from me to those who want to create peace and harmony in the world . '' 
Although the maharishi 's comments came before the July terror attacks on London , his declaration has divided followers in Britain and abroad concerned about his increasingly eccentric political views . 
In recent years , the maharishi , who broadcasts on a private satellite channel from a converted monastery in Vlodrop , in Holland , has proffered opinions on everything from crime to the Israel-Palestine conflict to how countries can best foster military defense . 
In the 1992 British general election his Natural Law party fielded 300 candidates in an attempt to win support for his `` age of enlightenment '' . 
George Harrison agreed to a benefit concert at the Royal Albert Hall to launch the campaign , but not one Natural Law candidate held on to his deposit . 
Undeterred , last year the maharishi - known to his followers as `` his holiness '' and to his detractors as the `` giggling guru '' because of his habit of laughing in interviews - began despatching yogic flyers to the US , India , China and Brazil in an attempt to foster global peace by building a `` coherent world consciouness . '' 
At the same time he ordered his followers at Skelmersdale , Lancashire - the site of an ideal maharishi village complete with a gold meditation dome - to beam peace-loving thoughts to the British electorate with the aim of overtuning the Labor government . 
It was the failure of that thought experiment that prompted the maharishi to withdraw from Britain , a decision first communicated to his followers in a conference call from Holland the day after the general election . 
`` It has had quite a deep impact on our organization , '' acknowledged Geoffrey Clements , the former Natural Law candidate for Southport who also chairs the maharishi 's UK charity . 
`` But the maharishi explained to us that the poison in this country was so concentrated that he felt it was no use our continuing to nurture creativity and intelligence here . '' 
Instead , Dr Clements said teachers of TM and the maharishi 's more advanced TM-Sidhi program , in which devotees learn to use yoga to `` levitate '' , were being encouraged to take teaching positions in South Africa and at the Maharishi University in Fairfield , Iowa , a campus built on Vedic architectural principles that is home to around 2,000 TM devotees . 
But other followers say they are astonished by the maharishi 's decison not to reject the US , particularly as last year he initiated a similar thought experiment there with the aim of defeating George Bush in a protest at his leading role in fomenting the Iraq war . 
While there is good scientific evidence that meditating twice a day can reduce stress and lower blood pressure , the maharishi 's detractors say that his claims that it can also cure cancer and prolong lifespans are unproven . 
They also argue that at around # 1,300 for a standard TM introduction course , and more for the advanced TM-Sidhi program , the maharishi 's fees are excessive . 
But the maharishi 's most questionable claim is that through concentrated meditation by small groups of yogic flyers his disciples can effect major changes on society via a phenomenon he calls the `` maharishi effect . '' 
`` In theory , you need ... about 8,000 people practising TM to effect more positive changes in -LRB- British -RRB- society , '' explains Dr Clements . 
`` But with the the more advanced TM-Sidhi program you can create the same levels of coherence with just 800 people . '' 
According to Dr Clements , between 1988 and 1991 100 TM-Sidhi practitioners meditating regularly at Skelmersdale were able to generate sufficient `` coherence '' in the local community to reduce crime on Merseyside by 16 % . 
By the end of the experiment Merseyside had moved from the third highest crime area in the UK to the second lowest . 
To generate a similar `` maharishi effect '' across the UK , however , Dr Clements said the Skelmersdale center would have needed much larger groups . 
`` Unfortunately , except for brief periods over last summer , we were n't able to create a critical mass , '' he said . 
`` That was a source of disappointment to the maharishi . 
There was a measure of exasperation when he spoke to us in May because there is a large percentage of people in this country who have expressed their distaste for the government but in the end he came to the conclusion that the tradition of divide and rule in Britain was too deeply embedded . '' 
Dr Clements , who last week attended a gathering in Holland of more than 1,500 followers of the maharishi to celebrate the organization 's golden jubilee , added that despite the maharishi 's decision , the mood of his British followers remained positive . 
However , Mike Owen , a psychotherapist with Sunabitur Healthcare , who has recommended TM to many of his patients , said that , for many , flying overseas was both impractical and prohibitively expensive . 
`` Whatever you think of the maharishi 's wilder theories , TM is a proven tool for reducing stress and anxiety , '' he said . 
`` It seems a shame to deprive ordinary people of that just because the maharishi considers our government bellicose and warlike . '' 
The Yogi effect : Flying - or hopping - to a higher plane Transcendental meditation is a set of Hindu meditation techniques which supposedly brings practictioners to a higher state of consciousness characterised as `` enlightenment '' or `` bliss '' . 
The method involves reciting a mantra , a secret expression unique to each practictioner . 
More than 5 million people around the world - and almost 200,000 in the UK - have learned the technique since it was founded by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in 1957 . 
In the early 1990s , television news programs featured clips of advanced TM practitioners , known as yogic flyers , apparently hovering off the ground while sitting in the lotus position . 
Closer inspection of the footage , however , showed that they were hopping , not flying . 
The two best-known British advocates of TM are the former Tory party leader William Hague and the industrialist and broadcaster Sir John Harvey-Jones . 
Sir John says TM has made him a much easier person to live with : `` I do n't make a drama out of a crisis . 
If I gave it up now , my wife would leave me . '' 
The Beatles song Sexy Sadie was originally called Maharishi , Maharishi , What Have You Done ? 
John Lennon wrote the song after becoming disillusioned when the maharishi allegedly made a pass at the actor Mia Farrow at his Indian ashram , but Lennon later changed the title at George Harrison 's instigation . 
The lyrics read : `` Sexy Sadie what have you done\/You made a fool of everyone . '' 
Followers of the maharishi believe that by collective meditation they can cause fundamental changes in the `` physical field '' which radiate throughout society . 
The phenomenon , known as the `` maharishi effect '' can be triggered by just 1 % of a population of more than 10,000 meditating , or the square root of 1 % in the case of advanced TMers in larger populations . 
In the early 1980s , followers credited the technique with bringing peace to a village of 12,000 in the Chouf mountains of Lebanon being shelled by the Israelis . 
In 2003 , as part of his worldwide campaign to create a `` global country of world peace '' , the maharishi issued his own currency , the raam . 
The brightly colored notes , in denominations of one , five and 10 raam , circulate both at his headquarters in Vlodrop in the Netherlands and at the Maharishi Vedic City in Iowa . 
The idea is for the 1.5 billion of the world 's population living in extreme poverty to use the currency to build new houses , roads , schools and health clinics .

2005-08-16,"As the US army faces what `` may be the toughest recruiting environment ever '' is it is upping its spending on recruitment next year to $ 320m up from $ 240m . 
This amounts to $ 4,000 per recruit if the army signs up 80,000 next year . 
July proved to a good month for the US army 's recruitment target . 
This branch of the US armed forces has struggled to meet its recruitment targets but last month it signed up 8,085 new recruits , beating its target of 7,450 . 
Still , when the army finishes its financial year on 30 September it is expected to be 7,000 short of its 80,000 recruiting goal . 
With public support for the war in Iraq steadily dropping , the army chief of staff , General Peter Schoomaker , tells the San Francisco Chronicle that next year `` may be the toughest recruiting environment ever . '' 
That 's no surprise when the army is up against the likes of Cindy Sheehan , who is camped outside George Bush 's Texas ranch in protest at the death of her son in Iraq . 
Media coverage of returning casualties from Iraq , such as this powerful piece in the Washington Post does the US army no favors either . 
Given this unpromising context , Business Week reports that the army will spend more money on recruitment ads next year , about $ 320m up from $ 240m this year . 
As it helpfully points out this amounts to $ 4,000 per recruit if the army signs up 80,000 next year - more than twice what Toyota spends to woo a new customer . 
As part of this marketing drive , the army has plans for 15 televised town hall meetings in which carefully selected soldiers will put a positive spin on the US presence in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
Meanwhile TV ads will target parents with one featuring a mother 's voice-over : `` Thanks for bringing the best out the best in my child . '' 
For those keeping tabs on the Pentagon 's recruitment efforts , the CounterRecruiter website , a project of the Indypendent , the newspaper of the New York City Independent Media Center , provides useful information , including the army 's controversial attempts to recruit from schools and universities . 
Yet while the army struggles to fill its ranks , this appears not to be the case with the navy , air force and Marines . 
According to Strategy Page , a site specialising on military issues as its name indicates , the army seems to be having trouble attracting those applicants who were unable to get into the other services . 
James Dunnigan , the editor in chief of Strategy Page , also notes that the army is having no trouble getting people who have served in Iraq to re-enlist . 
By the end of the year , the army expects to get 4,000 more re-enlistments than it expected , he writes . 
Yet even he does not deny that the army is having trouble getting new recruits . 
Given the situation , any idea of sending US troops to Iran must fill the army with dread .

2005-08-17,"The battle over the constitution is regarded by most Iraqi women , confined to their homes by the occupation , as an irrelevance Wednesday 17 August 2005 01.15 BST A prominent group of Iraqi women who backed the US-British invasion recently met the American ambassador in an effort to pressure the politicians drawing up Iraq 's constitution not to limit women 's rights . 
Western feminist groups and some Iraqi women activists fear that Islamic law , if enshrined as a main source of legislation , will be used to restrict their rights , particularly in relation to marriage , divorce and inheritance . 
The US claims to share this concern . 
Iraqi women generally do not . 
To understand why , perhaps we need to remember that this constitution is being written in a war zone , in a country on the verge of a civil war . 
This process is designed not to represent the Iraqi people 's need for a constitution but to comply with an imposed timetable aimed at legitimising the occupation . 
The drafting process has increasingly proved a dividing , rather than a unifying , process . 
Under Saddam Hussein , we had a constitution described as `` progressive and secular '' . 
It did not stop him violating human rights , women 's included . 
The same is happening now . 
The militias of the parties heading the interim government are involved in daily violations of Iraqis ' human rights , women 's in particular , with the US-led occupation 's blessing . 
Will the new constitution put an end to this violence ? 
Most Iraqi women try to cope sensitively with the predicament of dealing with the occupation and the rise of reactionary practices affecting their rights and way of life . 
This applies across the political and class spectrum , to the secular left as much as to moderate Islamists and nationalists . 
Most also feel that the constitution is not their priority , and that those writing such a crucial document should be able to think clearly , to think of tomorrow . 
To do that one must be free of today 's fears and able to enjoy basic human rights , such as walking safely in the streets . 
Iraqi women can not . 
Despite all the rhetoric of `` building a new democracy '' , Iraqis are buckling under the burdens and abuse of the US-led occupation and its local Iraqi sub-contractors . 
Daily life for most Iraqis is still a struggle for survival . 
Human rights under occupation have proved , like weapons of mass destruction , to be a mirage . 
Torture and ill-treatment - even the torture of children in adult facilities - is widespread . 
Depleted uranium and other banned weapons have been used against Iraqi cities by occupying troops . 
Iraqi women were long the most liberated in the Middle East . 
Occupation has largely confined them to their homes . 
A typical Iraqi woman 's day begins with the struggle to get the basics : electricity , petrol or a cylinder of gas , water , food and medication . 
It ends with a sigh of relief at surviving death threats and violent attacks . 
For most women , simply to venture on to the street is to risk being attacked or kidnapped for profit or revenge . 
Young girls are sold to neighbouring countries for prostitution . 
In a land awash with oil , 16 million Iraqis rely on monthly food rations for survival . 
None has been received since May . 
Privatisation threatens free public services . 
Acute malnutrition among children has doubled . 
Unemployment , at 70 % , has fuelled poverty , prostitution , backstreet abortions and honor killings . 
Corruption and nepotism are rampant in the interim government . 
Gender is no obstacle : Layla Abdul-Latif , the minister of transport in Ayad Allawi 's administration , is under investigation for corruption . 
A quota system imposed by Paul Bremer , the former head of the Coalition Provisional Authority , ensures women 's participation in the interim government , the national assembly and the committee appointed to write the constitution . 
Iraqi women 's historical struggle against colonial domination , and for national unity , social justice and legal equality , has been reduced to bickering among a handful of `` women leaders '' over nominal political posts . 
Powerless , holed up in guarded areas , venturing out in daylight only with armed escorts , and lacking any credibility among Iraqi women , the failure of these `` leaders '' is catastrophic . 
Like their male colleagues , they have adopted a selective , largely US-oriented approach to human rights . 
The suffering of their sisters in cities showered with napalm , phosphorus and cluster bombs by US jets , the death of an estimated 100,000 Iraqis -LRB- half of them women and children -RRB- , is met with rhetoric about training women for leadership and democracy . 
Documents released in March by the American Civil Liberties Union highlight more than a dozen cases of rape and abuse of female detainees , and reveal that no action was taken against any soldier or civilian official as a result - and that US troops have destroyed evidence , to avoid a repetition of last year 's Abu Ghraib scandal . 
The silence of female National Assembly members and interim-government and US-financed women 's NGOs is deafening . 
In Iraq , `` women 's rights '' is an absurd discourse chewing on meaningless words . 
No wonder that the US-funded NGOs , which preach western-style women 's rights and democracy , are regarded as vehicles for foreign manipulation and are despised and boycotted , even when they recruit liberal or left personalities . 
Iraqi women know that the enemy is not Islam . 
There is a strong antipathy to anyone trying to conscript women 's issues to the racist `` war on terror '' targeted against the Muslim world . 
Most Iraqi women do not regard traditional society , exemplified by the neighborhood and extended family , however restrictive at times , as the enemy . 
In fact , it has in practice been the protector of women and children , of their physical safety and welfare , despite lowest-common-denominator demands on dress and personal conduct . 
The enemy is the collapse of the state and civil society . 
And the culprit is the foreign military invasion and occupation .

2005-08-22,"The mood in America is shifting against the Iraq war , but it has found inadequate expression in Congress Monday 22 August 2005 00.02 BST The myth of Rosa Parks is well known . 
The tired seamstress who boarded a bus in Montgomery , Alabama , in December 1955 and refused to give up her seat to a white man has become one of the most enduring legends of the civil rights era . 
Her subsequent arrest started the bus boycott that launched the civil rights movement . 
It transformed the apartheid of America 's southern states from a local idiosyncrasy to an international scandal and turned a previously unknown 26-year-old preacher , Martin Luther King , into a household name . 
`` She was a victim of both the forces of history and the forces of destiny , '' said King . 
`` She had been tracked down by the zeitgeist - the spirit of the times . '' 
The reality was somewhat different . 
Parks was no victim . 
The zeitgeist did not track her down ; she embodied it . 
She had a long history of anti-racist activism and had often been thrown off buses for resisting segregation . 
Far from being a meek lady in need of a foot massage she was a keen supporter of Malcolm X , who never fully embraced King 's strategy of non-violence . 
`` To call Rosa Parks a poor , tired seamstress and not talk about her role as a community leader and civil rights activist as well , is to turn an organised struggle for freedom into a personal act of frustration , '' writes Herbert Kohl in his book She Would Not Be Moved . 
The story of collective struggles is all too often filtered through the experience of an individual . 
In a bid to render the account more palatable and popular , the personal takes precedence over the political . 
As a result the story may reach a wider audience ; but by the time they receive it , the agendas and the issues involved have often become distorted - to the detriment of both the individual and the movement . 
The story of Cindy Sheehan , the 48-year-old woman whose son Casey was killed in Iraq in April 2004 , is one such example . 
Until late last week , Sheehan was camping outside President George Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas , demanding to see the president . 
`` I want to ask him , why did my son die ? '' 
she told the Guardian . 
`` What was this noble cause you talk about ? 
And if the cause is so noble , when are you going to send your daughters over there and let somebody else 's son come home ? '' 
Sheehan , who has met the president once before and was not impressed , had planned to stay at what became known as Camp Casey for the whole of August but had to leave on Thursday because her mother became sick . 
With the help of PR consultants she was packaged as a grieving Everymother who wanted answers . 
Capturing the public imagination , over the past two weeks she has been a regular feature on US cable and network news , the letters pages and newspaper editorials . 
In turn , she has re-energised the anti-war movement . 
On Wednesday , thousands of people across the country attended 1,627 vigils in solidarity with her cause . 
Her popularity has made her a prime target for the right . 
One commentator on Rupert Murdoch 's Fox channel branded her a `` crackpot '' ; Christopher Hitchens derided her for `` spouting piffle '' and lambasted her protest as `` dreary , sentimental nonsense '' . 
Talk-radio king Rush Limbaugh said her story `` is nothing more than forged documents - there 's nothing about it that 's real '' . 
The backlash continued this weekend with the launch of a `` You Do n't Speak for Me Cindy '' tour heading for Crawford with the support of rightwing talk radio hosts , to set up a pro-war camp . 
The focus on Sheehan 's personal loss is indeed problematic . 
Bereavement , in and of itself , confers neither knowledge nor insight - only a particular sensibility that might lead to both and a compelling personal narrative through which to articulate them . 
To define her as a mournful mother , while ignoring that she is a politically conscious , media-savvy campaigner , which she has been for quite some time , does neither her nor her cause any favors . 
Indeed , those who focus on Sheehan 's woes , whether they support or attack her , miss the point entirely . 
Had she come to Crawford at Easter , she would most likely have gone unnoticed . 
The reason she has struck a chord is not because of the sorrow that is personal to her but because of the frustration she shares with the rest of the country over Iraq . 
That is also why the right have attacked her so ferociously and so personally . 
But unlike the Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in his swift boat , Sheehan will not be blown off course quite so easily . 
The public mood in America is shifting consistently and decisively against the war and Bush 's handling of it . 
Gallup has commissioned eight polls asking whether it was worth going to war since the beginning of the year : every time at least half have said no. . 
For the first time , most people believe the invasion of Iraq has made the US more vulnerable to further attacks . 
The number of those who want all the troops withdrawn remains a minority at 33 % - but that is double what it was two years ago , and still growing . 
The reason Sheehan has become such a lightning rod is because that mood has found only inadequate and inconsistent expression in Congress . 
It has been left to her to articulate an escalating political demand that is in desperate need of political representation . 
This marks not only a profound dislocation between the political class and political culture but a short circuit in the democratic process . 
The mainstream has effectively been marginalised . 
This is not particular to the US . 
In Britain , the view that there was a link between Iraq and the London bombings was shared by two-thirds of the population , but the handful of politicians who dared to mention it were shouted down in parliament and vilified in the press . 
In Germany , all the main parties support the labor market reforms that will cut welfare entitlements and reduce social protection , even though most of the population do not . 
But what many `` centre-left '' politicians regard as electoral expediency is actually becoming an electoral liability . 
Evidence exists that support for more radical stances is there if only they had the backbone to campaign for it . 
In Germany , a new leftwing party combining ex-communists and disaffected Social Democrats is attracting 12 % in polls and could yet rob the right of an outright victory next month . 
This month , in a congressional byelection in southern Ohio , Paul Hackett , a marine reservist who recently served in Iraq , stood for the Democrats on an anti-war platform . 
In a constituency where the Republicans won with 72 % of the vote nine months ago , Hackett branded Bush a `` chicken hawk '' . 
He won 48 % , turning a safe seat into a marginal . 
Sadly , such examples are all too rare . 
Sheehan has revealed both the strength and the weakness of the left . 
We have a political agenda that can command considerable mainstream support ; yet we do not have a political leadership willing or able to articulate those agendas . 
We wield political influence ; we lack legislative power .

2005-08-22,"Under US noses , brutal insurgents rule Sunni citadel Guardian gains rare access to Iraqi town and finds it fully in control of ` mujahideen ' Monday 22 August 2005 00.09 BST The executions are carried out at dawn on Haqlania bridge , the entrance to Haditha . 
A small crowd usually turns up to watch even though the killings are filmed and made available on DVD in the market the same afternoon . 
One of last week 's victims was a young man in a black tracksuit . 
Like the others he was left on his belly by the blue iron railings at the bridge 's southern end . 
His severed head rested on his back , facing Baghdad . 
Children cheered when they heard that the next day 's spectacle would be a double bill : two decapitations . 
A man named Watban and his brother had been found guilty of spying . 
With so many alleged American agents dying here Haqlania bridge was renamed Agents ' bridge . 
Then a local wag dubbed it Agents ' fridge , evoking a mortuary , and that name has stuck . 
A three-day visit by a reporter working for the Guardian last week established what neither the Iraqi government nor the US military has admitted : Haditha , a farming town of 90,000 people by the Euphrates river , is an insurgent citadel . 
That Islamist guerrillas were active in the area was no secret but only now has the extent of their control been revealed . 
They are the sole authority , running the town 's security , administration and communications . 
A three-hour drive north from Baghdad , under the nose of an American base , it is a miniature Taliban-like state . 
Insurgents decide who lives and dies , which salaries get paid , what people wear , what they watch and listen to . 
Haditha exposes the limitations of the Iraqi state and US power on the day when the political process is supposed to make a great leap - a draft constitution finalized and approved by midnight tonight . 
For politicians and diplomats in Baghdad 's fortified green zone the constitution is a means to stabilise Iraq and woo Sunni Arabs away from the rebellion . 
For Haditha , 140 miles north-west of the capital , whether a draft is agreed is irrelevant . 
Residents already have a set of laws and rules promulgated by insurgents . 
Within minutes of driving into town the Guardian was stopped by a group of men and informed about rule number one : announce yourself . 
The mujahideen , as they are known locally , must know who comes and goes . 
The Guardian reporter did not say he worked for a British newspaper . 
For their own protection interviewees can not be named . 
There is no fighting here because there is no one to challenge the Islamists . 
The police station and municipal offices were destroyed last year and US marines make only fleeting visits every few months . 
Two groups share power . 
Ansar al-Sunna is a largely homegrown organization , though its leader in Haditha is said to be foreign . 
Al-Qaida in Iraq , known locally by its old name Tawhid al-Jihad , is led by the Jordanian-born Abu Musab al-Zarqawi . 
There was a rumor that Zarqawi , Washington 's most wanted militant after Osama bin Laden , visited early last week . 
True or not , residents wanted to believe they had hosted such a celebrity . 
A year ago Haditha was just another sleepy town in western Anbar province , deep in the Sunni triangle and suspicious of the Shia-led government in Baghdad but no insurgent hotbed . 
Then , say residents , arrived mostly Shia police with heavyhanded behavior . 
`` That 's how it began , '' said one man . 
Attacks against the police escalated until they fled , creating a vacuum filled by insurgents . 
Alcohol and music deemed unIslamic were banned , women were told to wear headscarves and relations between the sexes were closely monitored . 
The mobile phone network was shut down but insurgents retained their walkie-talkies and satellite phones . 
Right-hand lanes are reserved for their vehicles . 
From attacks on US and Iraqi forces it is clear that other Anbar towns , such as Qaim , Rawa , Anna and Ramadi , are to varying degrees under the sway of rebels . 
In Haditha hospital staff and teachers are allowed to collect government salaries in Ramadi , the capital of Anbar , but other civil servants have had to quit . 
Last year the US trumpeted its rehabilitation of a nearby power plant : `` The incredible progress at Haditha is just one example of the huge strides made by the US army corps of engineers . '' 
Now insurgents earn praise from residents for allegedly pressuring managers to supply electricity almost 24 hours a day , a luxury denied the rest of Iraq . 
The court caters solely for divorces and marriages . 
Alleged criminals are punished in the market . 
The Guardian witnessed a headmaster accused of adultery whipped 190 times with cables . 
Children laughed as he sobbed and his robe turned crimson . 
Two men who robbed a foreign exchange shop were splayed on the ground . 
Masked men stood on their hands while others broke their arms with rocks . 
The shopkeeper offered the insurgents a reward but they declined . 
DVDs of beheadings on the bridge are distributed free in the souk . 
Children prefer them to cartoons . 
`` They should not watch such things , '' said one grandfather , but parents appeared not to object . 
One DVD features a young , blond muscular man who had been disembowelled . 
He was said to have been a member of a six-strong US sniper team ambushed and killed on August 1 . 
Residents said he had been paraded in town before being executed . 
The US military denied that , saying six bodies were recovered and that all appeared to have died in combat . 
Shortly after the ambush three landmines killed 14 marines in a convoy which ventured from their base outside the town . 
Twice in recent months marines backed by aircraft and armor swept into Haditha to flush out the rebels . 
In a pattern repeated across Anbar there were skirmishes , a few suspects killed or detained , and success was declared . 
In reality , said residents , the insurgents withdrew for a few days and returned when the Americans left . 
They have learned from last November 's battle in Falluja , when hundreds died fighting the marines and still lost the city . 
Now their strategy appears to be to wait out the Americans , calculating they will leave within a few years , and then escalate what some consider the real war against a government led by Shias , a rival sect which Sunni extremists consider apostasy . 
The US military declined to respond to questions detailing the extent of insurgent control in the town . 
There was evidence of growing cooperation between rebels . 
A group in Falluja , where the resistance is said to be regrouping , wrote to Haditha requesting background checks on two volunteers from the town . 
One local man in his 40s told the Guardian he wanted to be a suicide bomber to atone for sins and secure a place in heaven . 
`` But the mujahideen will not let me . 
They said I had eight children and it was my duty to look after them . '' 
Tribal elders said they feared but respected insurgents for keeping order and not turning the town into a battleground . 
They appear to have been radicalised , and condemned Sunni groups , such as the Iraqi Islamic party and the Muslim Scholars ' Association , for engaging in the political process . 
The constitution talks , the referendum due in October , the election due in December : all are deemed collaboration punishable by death . 
The task now is to bleed the Americans and destabilise the government . 
Some call that nihilism . 
Haditha calls it the future . 
Omer Mahdi was in Haditha for a Guardian Films project before security precautions forced it to be suspended .

2005-08-22,"Monday 22 August 2005 00.03 BST British officials are seriously concerned about the level of corruption in the Iraqi defense ministry , after the embezzlement of vast amounts of money earmarked for the country 's security forces . 
Officials from the British Ministry of Defense had already warned US and Iraqi authorities against the squandering of money - and have been proved right , on a catastrophic scale . 
A report compiled by the Iraqi Board of Supreme Audit has concluded that at least half , and probably more , of $ 1.27 bn -LRB- # 700m -RRB- of Iraqi money spent on military procurement has disappeared into a miasma of kickbacks and vanished middlemen - or else has been spent on useless equipment . 
The report , leaked to the US news organization Knight Ridder , comes as a blow to the credibility of the Iraqi army and its ability to contain the increasingly cogent insurgency . 
According to the report , led by former human rights minister Abdel Baset al-Turki , the vanished money came solely from Iraqi funds , not from foreign donations to Iraq 's military or the US-funded training budget . 
The report focuses on an eight-month period after the transfer of sovereignty from the US-led occupation to caretaker Iraqi authorities on June 28 2004 . 
The report found that contracts were awarded to favored weapons suppliers , via middlemen , without bidding or approval from the prime minister 's office . 
Contracts included a clause stating that the full value of deals was to be paid up front , in cash . 
All deals were done through third-party companies or agencies headed by Iraqi middlemen , who have disappeared , leaving the Iraqi government without recourse when it complained of unfulfilled contracts . 
Internal documents , said the report , `` incorrectly indicated that the -LRB- Iraqi -RRB- ministry of defense signed contracts with Poland , Arab countries , the United States and Europe , but we discovered that all contracts were signed and executed with Iraqi suppliers '' . 
Among those missing is a man called Nair Mohamed al-Jumaili , sole beneficiary of 43 out of 89 contracts , into whose bank account several million dollars was paid . 
Nine ministry officials , all of them appointed by the US , have been fired by the ministry , and face possible criminal charges . 
Among them is the ministry 's procurement chief , Ziad Cattan . 
Mr Cattan , who returned to Iraq two days before the war began , contacted Knight Ridder from hiding , to deny the charges and the claims that he took a 10 % finder 's fee on every contract . 
He said the Americans controlled the purse strings of Iraqi defense expenditure . 
During the period covered by the report , 20 US officials worked alongside the Iraqi defense ministry , and all the sacked officials had been appointed by the Coalition Provisional Authority - the administration headed by American Paul Bremer . 
British defense officials say that `` ultimately , Iraqi spending decisions are a matter for the Iraqi government '' .

2005-08-22,"Monday 22 August 2005 00.03 BST The United States has eased its opposition to an Islamic Iraqi state to help clinch a deal on a draft constitution before tonight 's deadline . 
American diplomats backed religious conservatives who threatened to torpedo talks over the shape of the new Iraq unless Islam was a primary source of law . 
Secular and liberal groups were dismayed at the move , branding it a betrayal of Washington 's promise to advocate equal rights in a free and tolerant society . 
Stalemate over the role of Islam , among other issues , meant last week 's deadline was extended for a week . 
Outstanding disputes could produce another cliffhanger tonight , triggering a further extension . 
The Bush administration , keen to show the political process is on track , has waded into negotiations and pressured all sides to compromise . 
Administration officials have suggested that the number of US troops could be reduced next year if Iraq makes political progress and enough Iraqi troops are trained to take on insurgents . 
But yesterday , a US general said the army was making `` worst case '' contingency plans to maintain troops at the current level for another four years . 
In an interview with the Associated Press , General Peter Schoomaker said the army had planned troop rotations up to 2009 to ensure enough soldiers would be available . 
But actual deployments will be decided by commanders in Iraq , if conditions allow , he added . 
There are currently 138,000 US troops in Iraq , including 25,000 marines . 
President Bush has repeatedly denied that the US intends to `` cut and run '' , leaving Iraq to the insurgents . 
`` Our troops know that they 're fighting in Iraq , Afghanistan , and elsewhere to protect their fellow Americans from a savage enemy , '' the president said yesterday in his weekly radio address . 
Conservative Shias , dominant in the Iraqi government , had clashed with Kurds and other minorities who wanted Islam to be `` a '' rather than `` the '' main source of law . 
According to Kurdish and Sunni negotiators , the US ambassador , Zalmay Khalilzad , proposed that Islam be named `` a primary source '' and supported a wording which would give clerics authority in civil matters such as divorce , marriage and inheritance . 
If approved , critics say that the proposals would erode women 's rights and other freedoms enshrined under existing laws . 
`` We understand the Americans have sided with the Shias . 
It does n't fit with American values , '' an unnamed Kurdish negotiator told Reuters . 
`` They have spent so much blood and money here , only to back the creation of an Islamist state . '' 
Dozens of women gathered in central Baghdad yesterday to protest against what the organiser , Yanar Mohammad , feared would be a `` fascist , nationalist and Islamist '' constitution . 
`` We are fighting to avoid becoming second class citizens , '' she said . 
The US embassy declined to discuss the negotiations but a state department official in Washington told the New York Times that the draft document should be judged in its entirety . 
There are conflicting signals about the prospect of a deal before the deadline , with some factions claiming divisions have narrowed , others saying they have widened . 
If a text is not handed to parliament by midnight , deputies could be asked to repeat last week 's vote and amend the existing law , which decreed the deadline , to extend it further . 
The alternative would be to dissolve parliament and call an election , something the ruling Shia and Kurdish coalition wants to avoid . 
If a text is agreed , there will be a referendum in October which - if passed - will pave the way for a December election . 
Sunni Arabs , a dominant minority under Saddam Hussein and now the backbone of the insurgency , fear a constitution which cedes autonomy to Kurds in the north and Shias in the south , leaving central government too weak to funnel oil revenues to Sunnis in the middle . 
The drafting committee 's 15-member Sunni bloc said it had been sidelined in recent days and appealed to the US and UN to ensure their voice was heard . 
US and British diplomats have suggested that federalism will be fudged enough to bring mainstream Sunnis on board and drain support from the resistance . 
Al Qaida in Iraq and other insurgent groups have threatened to kill Sunnis who register to vote , saying the political process is a US-orchestrated sham . 
Three Sunnis who erected posters in Mosul urging people to vote were murdered last week .

2005-08-23,"A declaration of war on this medieval royal prerogative Clare Short 's bill would bring conflict law in line with the modern world Tuesday 23 August 2005 00.08 BST From the strictly formal point of view , writes AJP Taylor in his Oxford History of England 1914-45 , Britain 's entry into the first world war was declared `` as though King George V still possessed undiminished the prerogatives of Henry VIII '' . 
A characteristically arresting thought . 
But this is just the start . 
`` At 10.30 pm on August 4 1914 , '' Taylor continues , `` the king held a privy council at Buckingham Palace which was attended only by one minister and two court officials ... The cabinet played no part once it had resolved to defend the neutrality of Belgium ... Nor did the cabinet authorise the declaration of war . 
The parliament of the United Kingdom , though informed of events , did not give formal approval to the government 's acts until it voted a credit of # 100 million , without a division , on August 6 . '' 
Nor was this the end of the prerogative powers . 
The governments and parliaments of Britain 's dominions were not consulted either . 
Each governor general proclaimed the war on his own authority - except in Canada , whose parliament , alone in the empire , voted its approval . 
Over 300 million African and Asian people across the globe were thus involved , without any consultation , `` in a war of which they understood nothing against an enemy who was also unknown to them '' , as Taylor puts it . 
The past is another country . 
They do things differently there . 
Except , actually , they do n't . 
Today it may be impossible to imagine many things about the first world war occurring in anything like the same manner . 
The suffering of the western front would not have lasted for a week in the age of the mobile phone or the human-rights lawyer , for example . 
But the prerogative power to take the nation to war , central to the process of August 1914 , is still there almost unamended , as though nothing has changed since the late middle ages . 
There is , of course , something of an exaggeration in this description . 
The royal prerogative powers , already formal in 1914 , are even more formal today . 
Democratic politics , at least as much as human-rights law , has transformed the political context not just of a decision to go to war but of all the residual prerogative powers . 
In practice the government exercises these powers on the crown 's behalf . 
And in practice it will only do so if parliament does not object . 
Nevertheless almost none of this is written down . 
In principle , if not in practice , a prime minister could take the nation to war in defiance of a parliamentary vote ; he wields a theoretical power that a believer in the divine right of kings would have recognized . 
Throughout the 20th century these powers remained mostly uncontroversial and unchallenged . 
Yet they persisted as the basis for war-making . 
In September 1939 the declaration was reported by Neville Chamberlain to parliament as an accomplished fact . 
MPs did get the chance to vote on substantive motions on the Korean war in 1950 and the Gulf war in 1991 , but only after troops had been deployed and hostilities had begun . 
The Iraq war in 2003 broke new constitutional ground in many ways , in particular because a British government for the first time allowed MPs a substantive vote on a war before it began . 
This was in one sense a tactical response to governmental weakness , an implicit recognition that domestic politics required Tony Blair to obtain the authority of parliament for an exceptionally divisive conflict . 
But it was also a response to a growing sense among constitutional reformers that the government 's exercise of this most powerful of prerogatives was now under greater question . 
Three months before the war , Blair debated this issue with the Commons liaison committee . 
He agreed with the MPs that it would be right for parliament , and good for government , for there to be a vote . 
`` There is a right to vote , '' he even told the committee , before entering a caveat . 
`` The question is , do you take that one step further and get rid of the royal prerogative . 
I do not see any reason to change it , but I do really think that in the end it is more theoretical than real , this issue . '' 
In practice , Blair said , `` I can not think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament . '' 
Arguably this was always the case . 
Yet it is important to recognize that the nature of modern warfare has significantly increased the realism of Blair 's statement . 
It is difficult to foresee the kind of total existential threat to the nation that British governments believed they faced in 1805 , 1914 or 1939 . 
The wars that Britain is likely to fight in the 21st century are likely to be fought exclusively by professional forces , as part of an alliance , in the name of the international order rather than exclusively national interest , with real-time media coverage on both sides of the frontline , and in circumstances that cause minimal or no disruption at all to everyday life at home . 
The longevity and adaptability of this country 's old war-making rules have been truly extraordinary . 
But modern wars fought in modern democratic societies are increasingly posing new questions and demanding new rules , as the historic parliamentary vote in March 2003 over Iraq implied . 
This is not to advocate change for change 's sake but to recognize that war-making in modern , rights-based societies requires new forms of legitimacy . 
Which is one of several reasons why Clare Short 's private member 's bill requiring parliamentary approval for military action is both so interesting and so important . 
Short 's bill requires governments to do what the Blair government did voluntarily in 2003 . 
But by explicitly removing war-making from prerogative powers and vesting that power in parliament , the bill goes significantly further . 
The bill requires a government to set out a written political and legal justification of armed action . 
If parliament does not approve , troops must not be committed . 
While allowing governments to embark on armed conflict in emergencies , the bill also gives MPs retrospective powers over emergency deployments . 
Short 's sponsorship will inspire some and provoke others . 
But it would be petty to see the bill as an excuse to rerun old arguments about Iraq . 
For this is , in the best sense , a modernizing measure . 
It seeks to bring both the law of war and the system of public accountability for war-making abreast of modern realities . 
It puts parliament in charge of the most important decision that any nation can ever take . 
Flaws the bill may have , but they can be ironed out in committee . 
The bill 's second-reading vote in October will be a defining moment for all MPs who claim to be modernisers . 
Already many big names in all parties have given their support . 
Not the least of those MPs was the late Robin Cook . 
If all those tributes to Cook mean anything at all then the vote on October 21 will be a chance to turn those words into something lasting and practical in his memory .

2005-08-24,"Wednesday 24 August 2005 00.44 BST When the US and Britain begin to pull out troops from Iraq next year , as they hope , George Bush will do everything he can to ensure his three-year Iraq adventure is not portrayed as a total failure . 
That is why events in Baghdad this week , with Iraqi politicians negotiating a draft constitution , are so important to him . 
The bare minimum he will want to be able to claim next year is that he has set Iraq on the road to democracy . 
The US-imposed schedule is supposed to be that Iraqi politicians agree among themselves a new constitution . 
The deadline was last week , extended to Monday and then tomorrow . 
The constitution is supposed to be put to a referendum on October 15 and a fresh batch of elections held in December . 
Job done and troop withdrawals can begin . 
The Iraqi politicians who produced a draft constitution in Baghdad this week are threatening to disrupt Washington 's plans . 
The negotiations , meant to find compromises that will unite the country , have instead highlighted the potential in Iraq for civil war and break-up . 
There is logic in the federal structure proposed in the draft constitution but the Sunnis , dominant under Saddam Hussein and now marginalised , fear that the Shias and Kurds are being given too much autonomy and this could lead to break-up . 
The Shias and the Kurds needed to be magnanimous towards the Sunnis this week , to find space for them in the political process . 
This they failed to do and that is ominous for the future . 
The Iraqi politicians claim the US is pushing them to make decisions too quickly and that the constitution is being drawn up to a US rather than an Iraqi timetable . 
They are right , but there is no guarantee that the Iraqi politicians would prove to be any less fractious if given more weeks or months . 
There was a mistaken assumption in Washington before the war that Saddam was so unpopular that the Iraqi population would embrace western-style democracy and values as a counterpoint to tyranny . 
Bush was warned that democracy in Iraq was more likely to produce an Islamist state than the secular one that he envisaged and the draft constitution bears this out . 
The draft version embraces Islam as the religion of the state and `` a fundamental source for legislation '' . 
The Islamisation of Iraq could prove awkward for the US as it prepares to leave because neither the basic rights of women or human rights in general are clearly protected . 
The constitution has fudged whether Islamic law - sharia - or human rights takes precedence . 
US and British diplomats argue , unsatisfactorily , that if you give people democracy , you have to live with the consequences . 
Bush will be hard-pushed to persuade anyone in Washington that Iran has not been a major beneficiary of the invasion . 
The Islamisation of Iraq , through the proposed enshrining of a role for clerics in the courts and law-making , takes the Shia-controlled south closer to the theocratic Iranian model . 
If all goes well and there is a compromise by tomorrow and the Sunnis do not come out to vote against the constitution in large numbers in October , wrecking it , Bush can at least claim a success of sorts . 
He has started the democratic process in Iraq and that is to be welcomed . 
But he would be leaving behind a democracy that is extremely vulnerable . 
A month before the invasion of March 2003 , Bush said a free Iraq could become `` a beacon of democracy across the Middle East '' . 
It is highly unlikely that Bush or anyone else in Washington , not even in the rightwing thinktanks , will be claiming Iraq as a `` beacon of democracy '' . 
They will not be making the boast at all if , as is likely , the US pulls out against a backdrop of insurgency , lawlessness , power cuts , erratic oil production , water shortages , the threat of break-up and the increased influence of Iran .

2005-08-25,"He 's a friend of Fidel Castro , a fierce critic of the war in Iraq , and wants to spread revolutionary fervor throughout South America . 
Venezuela 's president , Hugo Ch vez , has long been a thorn in the side of the US - a fact highlighted this week when televangelist Pat Robertson called for his assassination . 
Richard Gott on a man at war with the White House Hugo Chvez , the president of Venezuela , is a genial fellow with a good sense of humor and a steely political purpose . 
As a former military officer , he is accustomed to the language of battle and he thrives under attack . 
He will laugh off this week 's suggestion by Pat Robertson , the US televangelist , that he should be assassinated , but he will also seize on it to ratchet up the verbal conflict with the United States that has lasted throughout his presidency . 
Chvez , now 51 , is the same age as Tony Blair , and after nearly seven years as president he has been in power for almost as long . 
But there the similarities end . 
Chvez is a man of the left and , like most Latin Americans with a sense of history , he is distrustful of the United States . 
Free elections in Latin America have often thrown up radical governments that Washington would like to see overthrown , and the Chvez government is no exception to this rule . 
Chvez is a genuinely revolutionary figure , one of those larger-than-life characters who surface regularly in the history of Latin America - and achieve power perhaps twice in a hundred years . 
He wants to change the history of the continent . 
His close friend and role model is Fidel Castro , Cuba 's long-serving leader . 
The two men meet regularly , talk constantly on the telephone , and have formed a close political and military alliance . 
Venezuela has deployed more than 20,000 Cuban doctors in its shanty-towns , and Cuba is the grateful recipient of cheap Venezuelan oil , replacing the subsidised oil it once used to receive from the Soviet Union . 
This , in the eyes of the US government , would itself be a heinous crime that would put Chvez at the top of its list for removal . 
The US has been at war with Cuba for nearly half a century , mostly conducted by economic means , and it only abandoned plans for Castro 's direct overthrow after subscribing to a tacit agreement not to do so with the Soviet Union after the missile crisis of 1962 . 
The Americans would have dealt with Chvez long ago had they not been faced by two crucial obstacles . 
First , they have been notably preoccupied in recent years in other parts of the world , and have hardly had the time , the personnel , or the attention span to deal with the charismatic colonel . 
Second , Venezuela is one of the principal suppliers of oil to the US market -LRB- literally so in that 13,000 US petrol stations are owned by Citgo , an extension of Venezuela 's state oil company -RRB- . 
Any hasty attempt to overthrow the Venezuelan government would undoubtedly threaten this oil lifeline , and Chvez himself has long warned that his assassination would close down the pumps . 
With his popularity topping 70 % in the polls , he would be a difficult figure to dislodge . 
Chvez comes from the provinces of Venezuela , from the vast southern cattle lands of the Llanos that stretch down to the Apure and Orinoco river system . 
Of black and Indian ancestry , his parents were local schoolteachers , and he has inherited their didactic skills . 
His talents first came to the fore when he joined the army and became a popular lecturer at the war college in Caracas . 
He is a brilliant communicator , speaking for hours on television in a folksy manner that captivates his admirers and irritates his opponents . 
He never stops talking and he never stops working . 
He has time for everyone and never forgets a face . 
For several years he traveled incessantly around the country , to keep an eye on what was going on . 
This was not mere electioneering , for he would talk for hours to those who had hardly a vote among them . 
He exhausts his cadres , his secretaries and his ministers . 
I have traveled with him and them into the deepest corners of the country , and then , after a 16-hour day , he would call the grey-faced cabinet together for an impromptu meeting to analyze what they had discovered and what measures they should take . 
There was always a touch of the 19th century about this frenetic activity , as though the president were still on horseback , and Castro is known to have warned Chvez not to absorb himself unduly in the minutiae of administration . 
`` You are the president of Venezuela , '' he is reported to have said , `` not the mayor of Caracas . '' 
Chvez has taken the advice to heart , and has become less the populist folk hero and more the impressive statesman . 
Concern about possible assassination has long predated Robertson 's outburst , and for the past two years Chvez has cut down his travels inside the country and been accompanied everywhere by fearsome-looking guards . 
Abroad , however , he is a frequent visitor to the capitals of Latin America , and he is widely perceived as the leader of the group of left-leaning presidents recently elected in Brazil , Argentina , and Uruguay , as well as the inspiration of the radicalised indigenous movements now clamouring at the gates of power in Bolivia and Ecuador . 
There is another touch of the 19th century here , for Chvez is a follower and promoter of the ideas and career of Simn Bolvar , the Venezuelan leader who brought the philosophy of the European Enlightenment and the French Revolution to Latin America , and liberated much of the continent from Spanish rule . 
Chvez has labeled his movement the `` Bolivarian Revolution '' , and he hopes that his political ideas will spread throughout the continent . 
This in itself would be alarming enough to the United States , had it the time to pay proper attention . 
Equally worrying for the Americans is the time Chvez has devoted to the Middle East , successfully courting the governments that belong to Opec , the oil producers ' organization , some of whom have been labeled by the Americans as `` the axis of evil '' . 
Today 's high oil price has much to do with increased demand from China and India , and from the Iraq war , but the spadework that has given Opec fresh credibility was put in by Chvez . 
Soon he will be helping to show the new Iranian president , using the Venezuelan example , how to increase the revenues of a state-owned oil company and channel them into programs to help the poor . 
Chvez is widely popular today , but for much of his presidency he has been a contested , even a hated figure , arousing widespread discontent within Venezuela 's traditional white elite . 
Yet although his rhetoric is revolutionary , his reforms have been moderate and social democratic . 
He criticises the policies of `` savage neo-liberalism '' that have done so much harm to the poorer peoples of Venezuela and Latin America in the past 20 years , yet the private sector is still alive and well . 
His land reform is aimed chiefly at unproductive land and provides for compensation . 
His most obvious achievement , which should not have been controversial , has been to channel increased oil revenues into a fresh range of social projects that bring health and education into neglected shanty-towns . 
The hatred that he arouses in the old opposition parties , which have seen their membership and influence dwindle , lies more in ideology and racial antipathy than in material loss . 
Some opponents dislike his friendship with Castro , his verbal hostility to the United States , and his criticisms of the Catholic church , and some people still have a residual hostility to the fact that he staged an unsuccessful military coup in 1992 when a young colonel in the parachute regiment . 
Many Latin Americans still find it difficult to come to terms with the idea of a progressive military man . 
But mostly they are alarmed by the way in which he has enfranchised the country 's vast underclass , interrupting the cosy , US-influenced lifestyle of the white middle class with visions of a frightening world that lives beyond their apartheid-gated communities . 
Over the past few years this anxious opposition has made several attempts to get rid of Chvez , with the tacit encouragement of Washington . 
They organised a coup in April 2002 that rebounded against them two days later when the kidnapped Chvez was returned to power by an alliance of the army and the people . 
They tried an economic coup by closing down the oil refineries , and this too was a failure . 
Last year 's recall-referendum , designed to lead to a defeat for Chvez , was an overwhelming victory for him . 
The local opposition , and by extension the United States , have shot their final bolt . 
There is nothing left in the locker , except of course assassination . 
The fingers of mad preachers are usually far from the button , but the untimely words of Pat Robertson , easily discounted in Washington and airily dismissed by the state department as `` inappropriate '' , might yet wake an echo among zealots in Venezuela . 
A similar call was made last year by a former Venezuelan president . 
Assassinations may be easy to plan , and not difficult to accomplish . 
But their legacy is incalculable . 
The radical leader of neighbouring Colombia , Jorge Gaitn , was assassinated more than 50 years ago , in 1948 . 
In terms of civil war and violence , the Colombians have been paying the price ever since . 
No one would wish that fate on Venezuela .

2005-08-25,"The US is reeling , like imperial Britain after the Boer war - but do n't gloat Thursday 25 August 2005 00.03 BST If you want to know what London was like in 1905 , come to Washington in 2005 . 
Imperial gravitas and massive self-importance . 
That sense of being the center of the world , and of needing to know what happens in every corner of the world because you might be called on - or at least feel called upon - to intervene there . 
And yet , gnawing away beneath the surface , the nagging fear that your global supremacy is not half so secure as you would wish . 
As Joseph Chamberlain , the British colonial secretary , put it in 1902 : `` The weary Titan staggers under the too vast orb of his fate . '' 
The United States is now that weary Titan . 
In the British case , the angst was a result of the unexpectedly protracted , bloody and costly Boer war , in which a small group of foreign insurgents defied the mightiest military the world had seen ; concern about the rising economic power of Germany and the United States ; and a combination of imperial overstretch with socio-economic problems at home . 
In the American case , it 's a result of the unexpectedly protracted , bloody and costly Iraq war , in which a small group of foreign insurgents defies the mightiest military the world has seen ; concern about the rising economic power of China and India ; and a combination of imperial overstretch with socio-economic problems at home . 
Iraq is America 's Boer war . 
Remember that after the British had declared the end of major combat operations in the summer of 1900 , the Boers launched a campaign of guerrilla warfare that kept British troops on the run for another two years . 
The British won only by a ruthlessness of which , I 'm glad to say , the democratic , squeamish and still basically anti-colonialist United States appears incapable . 
In the end , the British had 450,000 British and colonial troops there -LRB- compared with some 150,000 US troops in Iraq -RRB- , and herded roughly a quarter of the Boer population into concentration camps , where many died . 
In a recent CNN\/Gallup poll , 54 % of those asked said it was a mistake to send American troops into Iraq , and 57 % said the Iraq war has made the US less safe from terrorism . 
The protest camp outside President Bush 's ranch in Crawford , which grew around the mother of a soldier who died in Iraq , exemplifies the pain . 
CNN last Sunday aired a documentary with top-level sources explaining in detail how the intelligence on Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction was distorted , abused , sexed up and , as the program was entitled , Dead Wrong . 
This will hardly be news for British or European readers , but the facts have not been so widely aired in the US . 
In another poll , the number of those who rated the president as `` honest '' fell below 50 % for the first time . 
This week , he has again attempted to bolster support for his administration and his war . 
It does n't seem to be working . 
A recent article in the New York Times plausibly estimated the prospective long-term cost of the Iraq War at more than $ 1 trillion . 
If Iraqi politicians do finally agree a draft constitution for their country today , only the world 's greatest optimist can believe that it will turn Iraq into a peaceful , stable , democratic federal republic . 
Increasingly , the Islamic Republic of Iran quietly calls the shots in the Shia south of Iraq . 
As the Washington joke goes : the war is over , and the Iranians won . 
Meanwhile , oil prices of more than $ 60 a barrel put the price of petrol at American pumps up to nearly $ 3 a gallon for basic unleaded fuel . 
For someone from Europe this is still unbelievably cheap , but you should hear the shrieks of agony here . 
`` Gas prices have changed my life , '' moaned a distressed Californian commuter . 
If higher energy prices persist , they threaten not just a still vibrant economy but a whole way of life , symbolised by the Hummer -LRB- in both its civilian and military versions -RRB- . 
Besides instability in the Middle East , the main force pushing up oil prices is the relentless growth of demand for energy from the emerging economic giants of Asia . 
The Chinese go around the world quietly signing big oil supply deals with any oil-producing country they can find , however nasty its politics , including Sudan and Iran . 
When a Chinese concern tried to buy a big California energy company , that was too much - American politicians screamed and effectively blocked the deal . 
China and India are to the United States today what Germany and America were to Britain a hundred years ago . 
China is now the world 's second largest energy consumer , after the United States . 
It also has the world 's second largest foreign currency reserves , after Japan and followed by Taiwan , South Korea and India . 
In the foreign reserve stakes , the US comes only ninth , after Singapore and just before Malaysia . 
According to some economists , the US has an effective net savings rate - taking account of all public spending and debt - of zero . 
This country does not save ; it spends . 
The television channels are still full of a maddening barrage of endless commercials , enticing you to spend , spend , spend - and then to `` consolidate '' your accumulated debt in one easy package . 
None of this is to suggest that the United States will decline and fall tomorrow . 
After all , the British empire lasted for another 40 years after 1905 . 
In fact , it grew to its largest extent after 1918 , before it signed its own death warrant by expending its blood and treasure to defeat Adolf Hitler -LRB- not the worst way to go -RRB- . 
Similarly , one may anticipate that America 's informal empire - its network of military bases and semi-protectorates - will continue to grow . 
The United States , like Edwardian Britain , still has formidable resources of economic , technological and military power , cultural attractiveness and , not least , the will to stay on top . 
As one British music hall ditty at that time proclaimed : And we mean to be top dog still . 
Yes , we mean to be top dog still . 
You do n't have to go very far to hear that refrain in Washington today . 
The Bush administration 's national security strategy makes no bones about the goal of maintaining military supremacy . 
But whether the `` American century '' that began in 1945 will last until 2045 , 2035 or only 2025 , its end can already be glimpsed on the horizon . 
If you are , by any chance , of that persuasion that would instinctively find this a cause for rejoicing , pause for a moment to consider two things : first , that major shifts of power between rising and falling great powers have usually been accompanied by major wars ; and second , that the next top dog could be a lot worse . 
So this is no time for schadenfreude . 
It 's a time for critical solidarity . 
A few far-sighted people in Washington are beginning to formulate a long-term American strategy of trying to create an international order that would protect the interests of liberal democracies even when American hyperpower has faded ; and to encourage rising powers such as India and China to sign up to such an order . 
That is exactly what today 's weary Titan should be doing , and we should help him do it .

2005-08-27,"Opposing viewpoints of protesters gathered near George Bush 's ranch in Texas . 
Photo : Joe Raedle\/Getty The police tape fluttering gently marks the front line . 
On one side sits a rag-tag collection of tents , home-made placards calling for the troops to come home and a long line of white crosses representing the soldiers killed in Iraq . 
On the other side of the small country lane there is a smart collection of garden-style awnings filled with fold-out canvas chairs , lined with glossy placards proclaiming `` Bush Country '' , `` IM4W '' and `` Support Our Troops '' . 
A sign on the highway welcoming visitors to Crawford declares the population to be 705 , but today the figure is likely to be at least four times that . 
Thousands of pro- and anti-war activists are making their way to this little corner of Texas for the culmination of protests that began when George Bush arrived for his five-week `` working vacation '' at the beginning of August . 
Leading the anti-war rally will be Cindy Sheehan , 48 , the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq , whose vigil outside Mr Bush 's ranch has given the US peace movement in America a new focus and forced the president on to the defensive . 
Ranged against her are various conservative activists and military families , including the `` You Do n't Speak for Me , Cindy ! '' 
tour , which began in Mrs Sheehan 's home town of Vacaville in California and is due to arrive in Crawford at midday today . 
Its figurehead is Deborah Johns , the mother of a marine serving in Iraq . 
The pro-war demonstrators will hold a rally in the little town , not far from Fort Qualls , which was set up in memory of Louis Qualls - a marine killed in Iraq last year but whose father , Gary , is a staunch Bush supporter . 
Between them they are determined to drag the spotlight away from Mrs Sheehan , and today 's two rallies promise a showdown . 
Waiting at Camp Reality - the pro-war activists ' name for their headquarters - is Valerie Duty , 46 , a local resident who declares a little coquettishly that she is a `` friend '' of the president . 
She is on the telephone when the Guardian arrives , trying to arrange a delivery of donated bottled water , a physical necessity in the wilting , 38C -LRB- 100F -RRB- heat . 
`` There has been a silent majority during the siege against our president , '' she says . 
`` But this weekend that majority is going to speak out . '' 
Mrs Duty says she respects Mrs Sheehan 's right to do what she is doing , but says she does not speak for the majority of soldiers ' families . 
`` She is a nice woman , I have met her several times ... but she is being used by these leftwing groups who want to get at the president . '' 
Mike Greenfield , 49 , from Colorado , agrees . 
`` They just hate Bush . 
They are losers and they are bad losers . '' 
Mr Greenfield criticises Mrs Sheehan 's connections with the leftwing group Moveon.org , and says he has heard that Michael Moore is helping to finance her campaign . 
Asked about the pro-war groups ' links with Move Forward America , which is sponsoring the `` You Do n't Speak For Us , Cindy ! '' 
tour , Mrs Duty says all their donations come from concerned individuals . 
New York Times columnist Frank Rich describes the attacks as the `` swift boating '' of Cindy Sheehan , a reference to the campaign to discredit John Kerry 's Vietnam war record that was credited with derailing his presidential campaign . 
But over at Camp Casey - named after Mrs Sheehan 's 24-year-old son - they accept the criticism as a badge of honor . 
Anne Wright , a career diplomat who resigned on the eve of the war , points out that the protest has come far from its start as three women sleeping in a car at the end of the road to Mr Bush 's ranch . 
`` There has always been a peace movement out there -LRB- but -RRB- finally we have managed to get some media attention , and it has given all those people out there a focal point . '' 
When Mrs Sheehan was forced to return home to California last week after her mother had a stroke , many expected the protest to fizzle out . 
But by the time she returned on Wednesday it had grown . 
Most of the protesters have moved to a field donated by a local farmer , a stone 's throw away from the presidential ranch . 
A big white marquee has been erected and minibuses shuttle protesters in from Crawford . 
In a kitchen area , volunteers prepare meals for up to 200 people , much of it with donated food - including 220kgs -LRB- 50lbs -RRB- of bison meat from a local farmer . 
`` I 'm a vegetarian cook but I was like , ` OK , I 'll cook meat for the revolution ' , '' said Rebekah Patrode , 28 , who drove 1,800 miles from Wendel in Massachusetts to be here . 
Joan Baez , the folk singer , came to talk to some of the families and ended up staying three nights , while organisers estimate that about 8,000 people have visited the site in the past three weeks . 
They are expecting at least 1,000 to come this weekend before the camp packs up on Wednesday . 
Conservatives have tried to dismiss the activists as the `` lunatic fringe '' of former Vietnam protesters , but not all are the usual suspects . 
Larry Donovan , 87 , has come 80 miles from his cattle ranch in Georgetown , Texas , to pay his respects to Mrs Sheehan . 
`` I just love her , '' he said , a cowboy hat protecting his head from the sun . 
`` With all the cheap politicians that we have it takes one lone woman to start something - but you know , I think that the politicians might just have to follow . '' 
Oliver Utne , 21 , a student from Connecticut , is directing traffic outside the camp . 
`` People like Karl Rove -LRB- Mr Bush 's political chief adviser -RRB- have done very good job of convincing people that if you are a mainstream American then you have to be in favor of the war . 
Well , I 'm a mainstream American and I wanted to come here to show that you do n't have to be a wacko to be against the war . '' 
The protesters at Camp Casey believe they are gaining ground . 
Mrs Sheehan will begin a country-wide bus tour when she leaves Crawford , ending in Washington DC on September 24 for a long-planned anti-war march through the capital . 
In reality , the turnout then will be a better barometer of public sentiment than which of the protests manage to mobilise the most support today . 
`` We hope that the people of America will use that event to put pressure on the White House and show in huge numbers the public angst and the need to end the war and stop killing people , '' Mrs Wright said . 
`` But you know , I feel we have the momentum now . 
I want to come here to show you do n't have to be whacko to be against the war . ''

2005-08-28,"Secret document said UK seen as ` crusader state'Read the document here The Foreign Office 's top official warned Downing Street that the Iraq war was fuelling Muslim extremism in Britain a year before the 7 July bombings , The Observer can reveal . 
Despite repeated denials by Number 10 that the war made Britain a target for terrorists , a letter from Michael Jay , the Foreign Office permanent under-secretary , to the cabinet secretary , Sir Andrew Turnbull - obtained by this newspaper - makes the connection clear . 
The letter , dated 18 May 2004 , says British foreign policy was a ` recurring theme ' in the Muslim community , ` especially in the context of the Middle East peace process and Iraq ' . 
` Colleagues have flagged up some of the potential underlying causes of extremism that can affect the Muslim community , such as discrimination , disadvantage and exclusion , ' the letter says . 
` But another recurring theme is the issue of British foreign policy , especially in the context of the Middle East peace process and Iraq . 
` Experience of both ministers and officials ... suggests that ... British foreign policy and the perception of its negative effect on Muslims globally plays a significant role in creating a feeling of anger and impotence among especially the younger generation of British Muslims . ' 
The letter continues : ` This seems to be a key driver behind recruitment by extremist organizations -LRB- e.g. recruitment drives by groups such as Hizb-ut-Tahrir and al Muhajiroon -RRB- . 
The FCO has a relevant and crucial role to play in the wider context of engagement with British Muslims on policy issues , and more broadly , in convincing young Muslims that they have a legitimate and credible voice , including on foreign policy issues , through an active participation in the democratic process . ' 
Al Muhajiroon , formed by Omar Bakri Mohammed , the radical preacher who fled Britain after the 7 July bombings , was a recruiting organization for young Islamic extremists in Britain . 
Attached to the letter is a strategy document , also obtained by The Observer , which reveals further concerns . 
It says Britain is now viewed as a ` crusader state ' , on a par with America as a potential target . 
` Muslim resentment towards the West is worse than ever , ' the document , ` Building Bridges with Mainstream Islam ' , says . 
` This was previously focused on the US , but the war in Iraq has meant the UK is now seen in similar terms - both are now seen by many Muslims as `` Crusader states '' . 
` Though we are moving on from a conflict to a reconstruction phase in Iraq , there are no signs of any moderation of this resentment . 
Our work on engaging with Islam has therefore been knocked back . 
Mr O'Brien -LRB- then a Foreign Office minister -RRB- has expressed his concern . ' 
However , all mention of the Iraq connection to extremism was removed from ` core scripts ' - briefing papers given to ministers to defend the government 's position on Iraq and terror . 
The document begins : ` We do not see the Muslim community as a threat . 
Muslims have always made , and continue to make , a valuable contribution to society . ' 
The lines to be used by ministers include measures designed to address Muslim concerns , such as the introduction of religious hatred legislation and tackling educational underachievement among Muslims . 
But there is nothing to address the concerns raised by Jay eight months earlier . 
The documents reveal deep divisions at the heart of government over home-grown religious extremism and its connections to British intervention in Iraq . 
The Prime Minister has consistently said that the bombers were motivated not by a sense of injustice but by a ` perverted and poisonous misinterpretation of Islam ' . 
Although Iraq was clearly used as a pretext by extremists , he said he believed it was ideology that drove them to kill . 
To press home the point , Downing Street issued a list of atrocities carried out before intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq . 
The claim was later undermined by the MI5 , which said that Iraq was the ` dominant issue ' for Islamic extremists in Britain . 
Jack Straw , the Foreign Secretary , also rowed back from his comments immediately after the bombings that there was no connection with Iraq and the terror threat after it became clear that the public remained unconvinced . 
But Jay 's letter shows that the Foreign Office was convinced that foreign policy played a key role in radicalising young Muslims . 
The letter outlines a list of 11 ` work streams ' to discourage extremism . 
They included delegations to the Islamic world , ministerial briefings for key members of the Muslim community and receptions to mark key Muslim festivals . 
It is not known how Turnbull responded to the letter , although it is clear that , by January , there was a significant difference between what was being said within the Foreign Office and what ministers were officially being permitted to say in speeches . 
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten last night called on the government to come clean about the link between extremism among British Muslims and anger about Iraq : ` For the government to deny a link between the war in Iraq and dismay among the Muslim community is ridiculous . 
But to try to cover it up , when senior civil servants have recognized the seriousness of the resentment , is even worse . '

2005-08-29,"Monday 29 August 2005 02.36 BST Not since the Rumble in the Jungle , when Muhammad Ali fought George Foreman in Kinshasa in 1974 , can there have been such an eagerly anticipated punch-up as the one due to take place in New York in a fortnight . 
Odds as to whether the bout will go the distance , or on who can deliver a knockout punch , are already being offered as ring-side seats are sought . 
The Grapple in the Big Apple will pit `` Gorgeous '' George Galloway , the MP , against Christopher Hitchens , the writer and polemicist , in a public debate over Iraq and US and British foreign policy . 
Political junkies in America are drooling at the prospect . 
When the anti-war Respect MP for Bethnal Green visited Washington earlier this summer to deliver a lecture on Iraq to a gobsmacked Senate and to denounce allegations made against him by Republican senators , he briefly exchanged verbal fisticuffs with the pro-war Hitchens , and accused him of being a `` drink-sodden former Trotskyist popinjay '' . 
Now it 's time for a re-match . 
The event will take place on September 14 in the Mason Hall at the Baruch College performing arts center in the Gramercy Park area of Manhattan . 
It may not have quite the whiff of Madison Square Gardens , and the cornermen will be more likely to have to deal with wounded pride than bloodied cheekbones , but the venom will be as potent as in any title bout . 
`` Galloway is the most electrifying man in political entertainment , '' says one US political blogger . 
`` Hopefully , George will follow up on his ... ` drink-sodden former Trotskyist popinjay ' jibe . 
That will take some beating , but I am confident he can top it . '' 
Galloway is described on promotional material for his American talking tour as `` the Brit who set Congress straight about Iraq '' . 
The referee - or moderator - will be Amy Goodman , veteran broadcaster for the leftist Pacifica radio network , who has a no-nonsense style of dealing with any troublemakers . 
Supporters of Hitchens are hoping their man can prevail . 
He was seen in light training at the Hay-on-Wye festival , when he dispatched anti-smokers who objected to his lighting up with a couple of low blows . 
On the conservative New Criterion magazine 's website , one fan ponders : `` Heck , I thought the UK deported Galloway back to Egypt with the rest of the clerics ... This is one cage match I surely plan to see . ''

2005-08-30,"How to stop civil war Nicaragua and South Africa , not the US , should be the inspiration for the people framing Iraq 's constitution Tuesday 30 August 2005 11.05 BST Between the idea and the reality falls the shadow of occupation . 
Whatever the parliamentarians in Iraq do to try to prevent total meltdown , their efforts are compromised by the fact that their power grows from the barrel of someone else 's gun . 
When George Bush picked up the phone last week to urge the negotiators to sign the constitution , he reminded Iraqis that their representatives - though elected - remain the administrators of his protectorate . 
While US and British troops stay in Iraq , no government there can make an undisputed claim to legitimacy . 
Nothing can be resolved in that country until our armies leave . 
This is by no means the only problem confronting the people who drafted Iraq 's constitution . 
The refusal by the Shias and the Kurds to make serious compromises on federalism , which threatens to deprive the central , Sunni-dominated areas of oil revenues , leaves the Sunnis with little choice but to reject the agreement in October 's referendum . 
The result could be civil war . 
Can anything be done ? 
It might be too late . 
But it seems to me that the transitional assembly has one last throw of the dice . 
This is to abandon the constitution it has signed , and Bush 's self-serving timetable , and start again with a different democratic design . 
The problem with the way the constitution was produced is the problem afflicting almost all the world 's democratic processes . 
The deliberations were back to front . 
First the members of the constitutional committee , shut inside the green zone , argue over every dot and comma ; then they present the whole thing -LRB- 25 pages in English translation -RRB- to the people for a yes or no answer . 
The question and the answer are meaningless . 
All politically conscious people , having particular interests and knowing that perfection in politics is impossible , will , on reading a complex document like this , see that it is good in some places and bad in others . 
They might recognize some articles as being bad for them but good for society as a whole ; they might recognize others as being good or bad for almost everyone . 
What then does yes or no mean ? 
Let me be more precise . 
How , for example , could anyone agree with both these statements , from articles 2 and 19 respectively ? 
`` Islam is the official religion of the state and is a basic source of legislation : no law can be passed that contradicts the undisputed rules of Islam . '' 
-LRB- In other words , the supreme authority in law is God . -RRB- 
`` The judiciary is independent , with no power above it other than the law . '' 
Or both these , from articles 14 and 148 ? 
`` Iraqis are equal before the law without discrimination because of sex , ethnicity , nationality , origin , color , religion , sect , belief , opinion or social or economic status '' ; `` Members of the presidential council must ... have left the dissolved party -LRB- the Ba'ath -RRB- at least 10 years before its fall if they were members in it . '' 
Faced with such contradictions , no thoughtful elector can wholly endorse or reject this document . 
Of course , this impossible choice is what we would have confronted -LRB- but at 10 times the length and a hundred times the complexity -RRB- had we been asked to vote on the European constitution . 
The yes or no question put to us would have been just as stupid , and just as just as stupefying . 
It treats us like idiots and - because we can not refine our responses - reduces us to idiots . 
But while it would have merely enhanced our sense of alienation from the European project , for the Iraqis the meaninglessness of the question could be a matter of life and death . 
If there is not a widespread sense of public ownership of the country 's political processes , and a widespread sense that political differences can be meaningfully resolved by democratic means , this empowers those who seek to resolve them otherwise . 
Last week George Bush , echoed on these pages by Bill Clinton 's former intelligence adviser Philip Bobbitt , compared the drafting process in Baghdad to the construction of the American constitution . 
If they believe that the comparison commends itself to the people of Iraq , they are plainly even more out of touch than I thought . 
But it should also be obvious that we now live in more sceptical times . 
When the US constitution was drafted , representative democracy was a radical and thrilling idea . 
Now it is an object of suspicion and even contempt , as people all over the world recognize that it allows us to change the management but not the firm . 
And one of the factors that have done most to engender public scepticism is the meaninglessness of the only questions we are ever asked . 
I read Labor 's manifesto before the last election and found good and bad in it . 
But whether I voted for or against , I had no means to explain what I liked and what I did n't . 
Does it require much imagination to see the link between our choice of meaningless absolutes and the Manichean worldview our leaders have evolved ? 
We must decide at elections whether they are right or wrong - about everything . 
Should we then be surprised when they start talking about good and evil , friend and foe , being with them or against them ? 
Almost two years ago Troy Davis , a democracy-engineering consultant , pointed out that if a constitutional process in Iraq was to engender trust and national commitment , it had to `` promote a culture of democratic debate '' . 
Like Professor Vivien Hart , of the University of Sussex , he argued that it should draw on the experiences of Nicaragua in 1986 , where 100,000 people took part in townhall meetings reviewing the draft constitution , and of South Africa , where the public made 2 million submissions to the drafting process . 
In both cases , the sense of public ownership this fostered accelerated the process of reconciliation . 
Not only is your own voice heard in these public discussions , but you must also hear others . 
Hearing them , you are confronted with the need for compromise . 
But when negotiations are confined to the green zone 's black box , the Iraqis have no sense that the process belongs to them . 
Because they are not asked to participate , they are not asked to understand where other people 's interests lie and how they might be accommodated . 
And when the whole thing goes belly up , it will be someone else 's responsibility . 
If Iraq falls apart over the next couple of years , it would not be unfair , among other factors , to blame the fact that Davis and Hart were ignored . 
For the people who designed Iraq 's democratic processes , history stopped in 1787 . 
Deliberative democracy is not a panacea . 
You can have fake participatory processes just as you can have fake representative ones . 
But it is hard to see why representation can not be tempered by participation . 
Why should we be forbidden to choose policies , rather than just parties or entire texts ? 
Can we not be trusted ? 
If not , then what is the point of elections ? 
The age of purely representative democracy is surely over . 
It is time the people had their say .

2005-09-01,"Why city 's defences were down Cuts in spending to raise levees blamed on cost of war in Iraq Thursday 1 September 2005 13.06 BST The Louisiana coastline may have been so badly damaged by the hurricane because manmade engineering of the delta has led to erosion of natural defences , according to the American Society of Civil Engineers . 
The engineering of the last 100 years that has reworked the Mississippi delta with thousands of miles of levees and flood barriers to protect communities and aid navigation , has also disturbed natural barriers which traditionally prevented storm surges and protected against hurricanes , says the society . 
`` Human activity , directly or indirectly , has caused 1,500 square miles of natural coastal barriers to be eroded in the past 50 years . 
Human activity has clearly been a significant factor in coastal Louisiana land losses , along with subsidence , saltwater intrusion , storm events , barrier island degradation , and relative sea level changes , '' the society said in a paper last year . 
It warned that `` New Orleans and surrounding areas would now experience the full force of hurricanes , including storm surges that top levee systems and cause severe flooding as well as high winds '' . 
The damage done this time may be also linked to White House cuts in funding for hurricane defense to pay for homeland security terrorist defences . 
Lloyd Dumas , professor of political economy and economics at the University of Texas at Dallas , criticised the government 's failure to oversee a more efficient evacuation . 
`` It 's remarkable that with the massive restructuring of the federal government that took place with the establishment of the Department of Homeland Security , they do n't have more well thought-out plans to evacuate a city like New Orleans , '' he said . 
`` An emphasis should be placed on plans that have multiple purposes , like evacuation plans for a city like New Orleans that can of course be useful in the event of a terrorist attack but also in the event of a natural disaster like this one ... There were plans during the cold war to evacuate major cities in a few days . '' 
Professor Dumas added that not enough provision seemed to have been made for poor people . 
`` There does n't seem to have been much attention paid to people who did n't have private automobiles , '' he said . 
`` I did n't hear anything about school buses or city buses being used to aim people out of town . '' 
He said that there appeared to be little forward planning to cater to those on low incomes who would be unable to return to their homes for up to two months but who would not have the money to pay for that time in a hotel . 
`` The Department of Homeland Security says on its website that it deals with natural disasters , '' he said . 
`` They do n't seem to have done a very good job . 
There does n't seem to have been any long-term planning . '' 
The war in Iraq was also being seen as playing a part in the federal response to the crisis . 
Many members of the National Guard who would normally have been swiftly mobilised to help in evacuation are on duty in Iraq . 
Although US air force , navy and army units were deployed to assist , the locally-based National Guard is depleted by the demands of the war . 
New Orleans , which is in a natural basin on the Mississippi floodplain , is on average about six feet below sea level and theoretically protected by the most sophisticated levee system in the world . 
According to the US corps of army engineers , which is responsible for maintaining flood defences , more than 1,200 miles of levees and floodwalls have been built to protect the city from the Mississippi and from hurricanes . 
The corps has long wanted to strengthen some of the levees which have been sinking , and on its website yesterday said it planned to build a further 74 miles of hurricane defences . 
But according to local media , it was last year refused extra funding by the White House which wanted to save money to pay for homeland security against terrorism . 
`` In its budget , the Bush administration proposed a significant reduction in funding for south-east Louisiana 's chief hurricane protection project . 
Bush proposed $ 10.4 m , a sixth of what local officials say they need , '' reported Newhouse News Service yesterday . 
Local officials are saying , the article claimed , that had Washington heeded warnings about the dire need for extra hurricane protection , including building up levees and repairing barrier islands , `` the damage might not have been nearly as bad as it turned out to be '' . 
Last year Walter Maestri , emergency chief for Jefferson Parish , Louisiana , one of the worst affected areas , reportedly told the Times-Picayune newspaper : `` It appears that the money -LRB- for strengthening levees against hurricanes -RRB- has been moved in the president 's budget to handle homeland security and the war in Iraq , and I suppose that 's the price we pay . 
Nobody locally is happy that the levees ca n't be finished , and we are doing everything we can to make the case that this is a security issue for us . '' 
In June 2004 , the corps ' project manager , Al Naomi , went before a local agency , the East Jefferson Levee Authority , and requested $ 2m for `` urgent work '' that Washington was now unable to pay for . 
`` The levees are sinking , '' he said . 
`` Everything is sinking , and if we do n't get the money fast enough to raise them , then we ca n't stay ahead of the settlement . ''

2005-09-02,"Katrina comes home to roost President Bush is to blame for the scale of the disaster as a result of his administration 's policies and actions Friday 2 September 2005 10.29 BST Biblical in its uncontrolled rage and scope , the storm has left millions of Americans to scavenge for food and shelter , and hundreds reportedly dead . 
With its main levee broken , the evacuated city of New Orleans has become part of the Gulf of Mexico . 
But the damage wrought by Hurricane Katrina may not entirely be the result of an act of nature . 
A year ago the US army corps of engineers proposed to study how New Orleans could be protected from a catastrophic hurricane , but the Bush administration ordered that the research not be undertaken . 
After a flood killed six people in 1995 , the Congress created the Southeast Louisiana Urban Flood Control Project . 
Operated by the corps of engineers , levees and pumping stations were strengthened and renovated . 
In 2001 , when George Bush became president , the Federal Emergency Management Agency issued a report stating that a hurricane striking New Orleans was one of the three most likely potential disasters - after a terrorist attack on New York City . 
But by 2003 the federal funding essentially dried up as it was drained into the Iraq war . 
By 2004 , the Bush administration cut the corps of engineers ' request for holding back the waters of Lake Pontchartrain by more than 80 % . 
By the beginning of this year , the administration 's additional cuts , reduced by 44 % since 2001 , forced the corps to impose a hiring freeze . 
The Senate debated adding funds for fixing levees , but it was too late . 
The New Orleans Times-Picayune , which before the hurricane published a series on the federal funding problem - whose presses are underwater and can now only put out an online edition - has reported : `` No one can say they did n't see it coming ... Now in the wake of one of the worst storms ever , serious questions are being asked about the lack of preparation . '' 
The Bush administration 's policy of turning over wetlands to developers almost certainly has contributed to the heightened level of the storm surge . 
In 1990 , a federal task force began restoring lost wetlands around New Orleans . 
Every two miles of wetland between the Crescent City and the Gulf reduces a surge by half a foot . 
Bush promised a `` no net loss '' wetland policy , which had been launched by his father 's administration and bolstered by President Clinton . 
But he reversed the approach in 2003 , unleashing the developers . 
The army corps of engineers and the Environmental Protection Agency announced they could no longer protect wetlands unless they were somehow related to interstate commerce . 
In response to this potential crisis , four leading environmental groups conducted a study that concluded in 2004 that without wetlands protection New Orleans could be devastated by an ordinary - much less a category four or five - hurricane . 
`` There 's no way to describe how mindless a policy that is when it comes to wetlands protection , '' said one of the report 's authors . 
The chairman of the White House 's council on environmental quality dismissed the study as `` highly questionable '' , and boasted : `` Everybody loves what we 're doing . '' 
`` My administration 's climate change policy will be science-based , '' President Bush declared . 
But in 2002 , when the Environmental Protection Agency submitted a study on global warming to the UN , reflecting its expert research , Bush derided it as `` a report put out by a bureaucracy '' , and excised the climate change assessment from its annual report . 
The next year , when the EPA issued its first comprehensive Report on the Environment , stating : `` Climate change has global consequences for human health and the environment '' , the White House simply removed the line and all such conclusions . 
At the G8 meeting in Gleneagles this year , Bush stymied any common action on global warming . 
But scientists have continued to accumulate impressive data on the rising temperature of the oceans , producing more severe hurricanes . 
In February 2004 , 60 scientists warned in a statement , Restoring Scientific Integrity in Policymaking : `` Successful application of science has played a large part in the policies that have made the US the world 's most powerful nation and its citizens increasingly prosperous and healthy ... Indeed , this principle has long been adhered to by presidents and administrations of both parties in forming and implementing policies . 
The administration of George W Bush has , however , disregarded this principle ... The distortion of scientific knowledge for partisan political ends must cease ... '' Bush ignored the statement . 
In the two weeks preceding the storm , the trumping of science by ideology and expertise by special interests accelerated . 
The Food and Drug Administration announced it was postponing sale of the morning-after pill , despite overwhelming scientific evidence of its safety and approval by the FDA 's scientific advisory board . 
The UN special envoy for HIV\/Aids in Africa accused the Bush administration of responsibility for a condom shortage in Uganda as a result of pushing its evangelical Christian agenda of `` abstinence '' . 
The chief of the board of justice statistics in the justice department was ordered by the White House to delete its study that African-Americans and minorities are subject to racial profiling in police traffic stops . 
He refused to concede and was forced to quit . 
When the army 's chief contracting oversight analyst objected to a $ 7bn no-bid contract awarded for work in Iraq to Halliburton , she was demoted despite her superior professional ratings . 
On the day the levee burst in New Orleans , Bush delivered a speech comparing the Iraq war to the second world war and himself to Franklin D Roosevelt : `` And he knew that the best way to bring peace and stability to the region was by bringing freedom to Japan . '' 
Bush had boarded his very own Streetcar Named Desire .

2005-09-02,"If you want to know what London was like in 1905 , come to Washington in 2005 . 
Imperial gravitas and massive self-importance . 
That sense of being the center of the world , and of needing to know what happens in every corner of the world because you might be called on - or at least feel called upon - to intervene there . 
And yet , gnawing away beneath the surface , the nagging fear that your global supremacy is not half so secure as you would wish . 
As Joseph Chamberlain , the British colonial secretary , put it in 1902 : `` The weary Titan staggers under the too vast orb of his fate . '' 
The United States is now that weary Titan . 
In the British case , the angst was a result of the unexpectedly protracted , bloody and costly Boer war , in which a small group of foreign insurgents defied the mightiest military the world had seen ; concern about the rising economic power of Germany and the US ; and a combination of imperial overstretch with socio-economic problems at home . 
In the American case , it 's a result of the unexpectedly protracted , bloody and costly Iraq war , in which a small group of foreign insurgents defies the mightiest military the world has seen ; concern about the rising economic power of China and India ; and a combination of imperial overstretch with socio-economic problems at home . 
Iraq is America 's Boer war . 
Remember that after the British had declared the end of major combat operations in the summer of 1900 , the Boers launched a campaign of guerrilla warfare that kept British troops on the run for another two years . 
The British won only by a ruthlessness of which , I 'm glad to say , the democratic , squeamish and still basically anti-colonialist US appears incapable . 
In the end , the British had 450,000 British and colonial troops there -LRB- compared with some 150,000 US troops in Iraq -RRB- , and herded roughly a quarter of the Boer population into concentration camps , where many died . 
In a recent CNN\/Gallup poll , 54 % of those asked said it was a mistake to send American troops into Iraq , and 57 % said the Iraq war has made the US less safe from terrorism . 
The protest camp outside President Bush 's ranch in Crawford , which grew around the mother of a soldier who died in Iraq , exemplifies the pain . 
CNN has aired a documentary explaining in detail how the intelligence on Saddam 's weapons of mass destruction was distorted , abused , sexed up and , as the program was entitled , Dead Wrong . 
This will hardly be news for British or European readers , but the facts have not been so widely aired in the US . 
In another poll , the number of those who rated the president as `` honest '' fell below 50 % for the first time . 
He has again attempted to bolster support for his administration and his war . 
It does n't seem to be working . 
A recent article in the New York Times plausibly estimated the prospective long-term cost of the Iraq War at more than $ 1 trillion . 
Now that Iraqi politicians have finally agreed a draft constitution for their country , only the world 's greatest optimist can believe that it will turn Iraq into a peaceful democratic federal republic . 
Increasingly , the Islamic Republic of Iran quietly calls the shots in the Shia south of Iraq . 
As the Washington joke goes : the war is over , and the Iranians won . 
Meanwhile oil prices of $ 70 a barrel put the price of petrol at American pumps up to $ 3 a gallon for basic unleaded fuel . 
For someone from Europe this is still unbelievably cheap , but you should hear the shrieks of agony . 
`` Gas prices have changed my life , '' moaned a distressed California commuter . 
If higher energy prices persist , they threaten not just a still vibrant economy but a whole way of life , symbolised by the Hummer . 
Besides instability in the Middle East , the main force pushing up oil prices is the relentless growth of demand for energy from the emerging economic giants of Asia . 
The Chinese go around the world quietly signing big oil supply deals with any oil-producing country they can find , however nasty its politics , including Sudan and Iran . 
When a Chinese concern tried to buy a big California energy company , that was too much - American politicians screamed and effectively blocked the deal . 
China and India are to the US today what Germany and America were to Britain a hundred years ago . 
China is now the world 's second-largest energy consumer , after the US . 
It also has the world 's second-largest foreign currency reserves , after Japan and followed by Taiwan , South Korea and India . 
In the foreign reserve stakes , the US comes only ninth , after Singapore and just before Malaysia . 
According to some economists , the US has an effective net savings rate - taking account of all public spending and debt - of zero . 
It does not save ; it spends . 
TV channels are full oof commercials , enticing you to spend , spend , spend - and then to `` consolidate '' your debt in one easy package . 
None of this is to suggest that the US will decline and fall tomorrow . 
After all , the British empire lasted for another 40 years after 1905 . 
In fact , it grew to its largest extent after 1918 , before it signed its own death warrant by expending its blood and treasure to defeat Adolf Hitler -LRB- not the worst way to go -RRB- . 
Similarly , one may anticipate that America 's informal empire - its network of military bases and semi-protectorates - will continue to grow . 
The US , like Edwardian Britain , still has formidable resources of economic , technological and military power , cultural attractiveness and , not least , the will to stay on top . 
As one British music hall ditty at that time proclaimed : And we mean to be top dog still . 
Yes , we mean to be top dog still . 
You do n't have to go very far to hear that refrain in Washington today . 
The Bush administration 's national security strategy makes no bones about the goal of maintaining military supremacy . 
But whether the `` American century '' that began in 1945 will last until 2045 , 2035 or only 2025 , its end can already be glimpsed on the horizon . 
If you are , by any chance , of that persuasion that would instinctively find this a cause for rejoicing , pause for a moment to consider two things : first , that major shifts of power between rising and falling great powers have usually been accompanied by major wars ; and second , that the next top dog could be a lot worse . 
So this is no time for schadenfreude . 
It 's a time for critical solidarity . 
A few far-sighted people in Washington are beginning to formulate a long-term American strategy of trying to create an international order that would protect the interests of liberal democracies even when American hyperpower has faded ; and to encourage rising powers such as India and China to sign up to such an order . 
That is exactly what today 's weary Titan should be doing , and we should help him do it .

2005-09-03,"Saturday 3 September 2005 00.05 BST US allies are quitting Iraq in droves but the coalition of the willing is not quite dead : 40 Estonian soldiers hope their corner of Baghdad will remain forever Baltic . 
The light infantry platoon , Estonia 's sum contribution to the war , is responsible for Abu Ghraib district , a cauldron of rubble and violence . 
The platoon loves it . 
`` We are learning a lot . 
What it 's like being under fire , stuff like that , '' said Sergeant Peter Heinsaar , 25 . 
Back home in Tallinn soldiers compete to be on the next rotation . 
It was a gleam of consolation for Washington when its coalition of the willing showed fresh signs of wilting . 
Bulgaria 's new government said yesterday it would withdraw all its 370 troops . 
A Latvian ruling coalition party wants to end its 136-strong Iraq mission . 
Japan 's main opposition said it would pull out its 500-strong contingent if it won next month 's election , while Italy withdrew 300 soldiers last month and Poland 's 2,400-strong force will go soon , as will Ukraine 's . 
Estonia , keen to strengthen bonds with Nato as a safeguard against Russia , is more enthusiastic . 
The prime minister , Andrus Ansip , told a US delegation he wanted his troops to stay after their mandate expires in December , despite much public opposition . 
On patrol near Abu Ghraib jail in western Baghdad , Estonian soldiers said there was no place they would rather be . 
`` I like to be on missions , '' said Corporal Toomas Kunnapuu , 23 . 
No one cited fighting terrorism or sowing democracy . 
All full-time professionals in a volunteer army , for them the tour was about adventure , experience , advancing career prospects and a 500 % pay rise to # 1,700 while in Iraq . 
Sgt Ramil Sadikov , 30 , said : `` In Bosnia you could sit and enjoy nature , here you have to keep your eyes open . '' 
Since 2003 two Estonians have been killed and 10 wounded , a high proportion for a tiny force , but Captain Andrus Merilo , 31 , was upbeat . 
`` This is better than being a staff officer at HQ next to the coffee machine . '' 
US officers praised the troops for finding arms caches and gleaning intelligence while on foot patrols , second nature for Estonian soldiers trained for guerrilla warfare . 
They do not display the flag on vehicles and locals often mistake them for Russians .

2005-09-03,"Saturday 3 September 2005 13.38 BST The fallout from the Gulf coast disaster could take a heavy political toll on President George Bush , who has been accused by some of fiddling while New Orleans drowns . 
His already plummeting popularity rating is likely to take another big hit , according to experts who say the public largely see his response to the tragedy as several days too late , inadequate and insincere . 
Visiting the storm-wrecked town of Biloxi , Mississippi , Mr Bush hugged a sobbing survivor . 
The woman , Bronwynne Bassier , 23 , clutched a plastic bag containing all she had rescued from her wrecked home . 
`` We 're going to get you some help , '' Mr Bush said . 
`` Hang in there . 
Help is on the way . '' 
Later on the tour , Mr Bush was asked if the US could continue spending billions of dollars in the war in Iraq amid the hurricane crisis . 
He replied : `` We 've got plenty of resources to do both . 
We 'll secure our country from the terrorists and we 'll rebuild this area . 
We 've got what it takes to do more than one thing . '' 
But even as the rescue operation continues , anger is growing that the administration 's focus on the war in Iraq diminished its ability to respond adequately to a growing crisis at home . 
`` There 's no doubt it has already led people to further question the president 's involvement in Iraq , '' said William Stewart , professor emeritus of political science at the University of Alabama . 
`` If we did n't have so many resources there , we might have been able to respond to the tragedy here at home more quickly . '' 
Public dissent over Mr Bush 's reaction is reflected in newspaper editorials , radio talk shows and weblogs . 
The New York Times described the president 's first public comments on the tragedy on Wednesday , two days after the storm hit , as `` one of the worst speeches of his career '' . 
Its columnist Paul Krugman wrote : `` America , once famous for its can-do attitude , now has a ca n't - do government that makes excuses instead of doing its job . 
And while it makes those excuses , Americans are dying . '' 
Amanda Lang , a retired US army officer and political commentator writing on the Opednews.com weblog , attacked the president for staying on vacation at his Crawford ranch for three days before returning to Washington . 
`` He treats his own citizens with the same contempt and callousness as he does the Iraqi civilians , as ` collateral damage ' , '' Professor Lang said . 
Referring to Mr Bush 's address to citizens of the Gulf coast , she added : `` His heart and prayers may have been there , but his ass sure was n't . '' 
Those directly involved in the tragedy have also spoken out . 
Ray Nagin , the New Orleans mayor , reflected the anger of his stranded citizens when he told a local radio station : `` We had an incredible crisis here and his flying over in Air Force One does not do it justice . 
They flew down here one time two days after the doggone event was over with TV cameras , AP reporters , all kind of goddamn - excuse my French , everybody in America , but I am pissed -LRB- off -RRB- . '' 
Prof Stewart said Mr Bush 's early handling of the situation was definitely `` not a plus '' but that he was always going to receive criticism regardless of his actions . 
`` It is easy to say in retrospect that he should have done such and such but , because of the scale of the problems , any administration would have been underprepared . '' 
Political enemies wasted little time in weighing in . 
President Hugo Chvez of Venezuela , a long-time critic who refers to Mr Bush as Mr Danger , said : `` That man , the king of vacations , said nothing but ` you have to flee ' , and did not say how . 
It 's cowboy mentality . '' 
With a war in the Middle East , economic difficulties at home , including soaring petrol prices , and now the nation 's largest natural disaster to deal with , Mr Bush is facing his biggest challenge since the 2001 terrorist attacks . 
`` This is a supreme test of Bush 's leadership at a time when resources are thin and his approval ratings are perilously low , '' poll expert John Zogby told Reuters . 
`` The president is going to have to do a lot more than a 25-minute flyover . ''

2005-09-05,"If I knew how dangerous it would be , I might have reconsidered taking the job . 
Becoming Reuters Baghdad bureau chief after the fall of Saddam Hussein presented a huge safety risk . 
But I did n't expect the danger would still be as intense after more than two years . 
The office , protected by guards armed with Kalashnikovs , was turned into a fortress . 
Driving around was only possible in armored cars . 
Now I know why there was n't a queue of Reuters staff for the assignment . 
But I joined the wire service 11 years ago , inspired by the journalism of the Vietnam war , looking to travel and write . 
I joined the trainee scheme fresh from university . 
Under the guidance of Fleet Street veteran George Short , I wrote imaginary dispatches about coups and crises - and the verdicts could be brutal . 
As I was only fluent in English - an anomaly among the participants on the scheme - Dublin was my first destination with Reuters in the mid-1990s . 
The first time I was in the office by myself when a big story broke was very stressful . 
My finger hovered nervously over the enter key on the keyboard - then it was straight to the nearest pub . 
Much of the organization 's work is covering the financial markets and I was sent to Frankfurt to report the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors . 
It was a high-pressure environment , competing with Bloomberg and Dow Jones to be first with the news ; wins and losses were measured in milliseconds . 
It was never an ambition to be doing that , so when the Jakarta bureau was short-staffed in 1998 I jumped at the chance to go . 
I landed at the right time . 
Indonesia had been stable for 30 years , but within a week of my arrival , the capital exploded in rioting - for the first time I was at the center of a huge international story and being tear-gassed . 
The anxiety I experienced then returns every time I am in a new country . 
But it prepared me for the dangers I faced during the 1999 East Timor crisis , underlined by the death of a Dutch journalist . 
Thankfully , I was under the guidance of Kurt Schork , a truly inspirational figure who was later killed in Sierra Leone . 
From there I was posted in Bangkok , a regional hub covering several countries , which involved a lot of traveling . 
Burma was a tragic place to visit , but I was lucky to be there when Aung San Suu Kyi was released from house arrest . 
Amid scenes of mass celebrations , it reminded me why I loved being a reporter : to meet amazing people from around the globe . 
When the Afghanistan war started in 2001 , I was itching to go in . 
But frustratingly , I had not completed the requisite training back in Britain . 
I rushed home to do it , enabling me to be based in Kandahar , albeit after the fall of Kabul . 
The only reason I was there was in case Osama bin Laden was captured nearby , but in reality , little was going on . 
In this job you often find yourself marooned somewhere for weeks because something could happen and we must be there if it does . 
I do envy my newspaper colleagues , because they have the time to pursue their own stories , confident that wire services can tell the main story of the day as a backup . 
Yet I do n't feel in direct competition with them , apart from in terms of finding scoops . 
I like the adrenaline ; as soon as something happens , you have to report it . 
In Kandahar , though , I proved you can make a story out of anything by chatting to locals . 
My war reporting experience saw me sent to Kuwait ahead of the Iraq war in 2003 . 
The plan was to be embedded with the US military and I underwent chemical and biological warfare training . 
But as the war became delayed , I faced a personal dilemma : my sister was getting married at the start of April and I had to decide whether to invade Iraq with the US Marines or attend the wedding . 
It would have been the biggest story of my life , but I went home . 
After the war I was able to go into Basra and from there I took on the Baghdad job . 
I do n't think anybody in journalism has experienced conditions like those in the Iraqi capital and faced a comparable level of risk for such a sustained period of time . 
The main stress was n't for my own safety - running things from the office , I did n't go out much - but for my team of around 50 Iraqi staff who were putting themselves in extreme danger . 
On leave for a couple of weeks , I would try to de-stress in England or on a beach in Thailand . 
But I would get depressed when I switched on CNN and saw the carnage from Iraq . 
I found it astonishing that I worked there and would question the wisdom of going back . 
On my return , I would wonder whether the holiday was worthwhile . 
After two years in the role - one of the longest serving journalists in Iraq since the war - I felt it was time to get out a couple of months ago . 
Leaving behind my Iraqi colleagues was hard , because they will still have to live through the difficult conditions . 
When I was back in London , I was n't due to be working , but on July 7 I raced into the office to help with the coverage of the bombings . 
I thought I had left behind multiple suicide bombings and I did n't expect to be writing about them happening at home .

2005-09-05,"Monday 5 September 2005 00.00 BST A Sunni Arab teenager who died saving Shias during last week 's stampede disaster in Baghdad has been hailed as a hero whose sacrifice should unify Iraq . 
Othman al-Ubeydi drowned after rescuing at least three people who tumbled into the Tigris when Shia pilgrims panicked at rumors of a suicide bomber among them , leading to 1,005 deaths . 
The 19-year-old student 's face was on newspapers and television screens yesterday and the provincial council said that a street would be named after him . 
Mr Ubeydi was sitting down to breakfast last Wednesday when loudspeakers from his Sunni mosque said Shias needed help at the al-Aima bridge , where Iraq 's deadliest disaster since the 2003 invasion was unfolding . 
While hundreds were crushed to death on the bridge , hundreds more jumped or fell into the river . 
Witnesses said that the teenager , a strong swimmer and wrestler who trained at a gym , repeatedly dived in and saved between three and seven people . 
However he was exhausted when he tried to save a large woman , and she reportedly pulled him under . 
Iraq 's government and media called Mr Ubeydi a martyr of national unity whose heroic sacrifice should reconcile Shias and Sunnis , rival Muslim sects which have edged towards civil war . 
`` He showed that we are all brothers , '' said the Shia prime minister , Ibrahim al-Jaafari , while visiting the family . 
Mr Ubeydi 's father , Ali , said that his studious son had passed the supreme test of humanity , setting an example for the country . 
`` He turned his soul into a bridge to save others . '' 
One newspaper , Itijah al-Akhar , illustrated the theme with a bridge in the shape of two hands shaking . 
Another paper , Al Mada , showed a flower growing from a cactus . 
A state television network , al-Iraqiya , showed Shias and Sunnis chanting together . 
Um Qasim , 54 , a Shia who lost her son to an insurgent attack , said that Mr Ubeydi was a hero . 
`` We are one nation , '' she added . 
Iraqi Sunnis , a once dominant minority , have been marginalised since the fall of Saddam Hussein . 
Their insurgency against the Shia-led government has produced escalating tit-for-tat assassinations and massacres . 
However , few expect Mr Ubeydi 's story to turn back the sectarian tide . 
Though there was no suicide bomber , many Shias blamed last week 's stampede on a climate of fear fostered by the insurgents . 
A subsequent spate of attacks against Sunnis was thought to be a backlash , and a unity rally near the bridge at the weekend fizzled out . 
Shots were exchanged between the Shia west bank of the Tigris and the Sunni east bank . 
Saddam is scheduled to go on trial on a charge of mass killing on October 19 , Iraq 's government spokesman confirmed yesterday , adding that several of the ousted dictator 's associates , including one of his half-brothers , would face trial with him . 
`` They will be tried for the execution of 143 citizens , '' he said , referring to reprisals for an assassination attempt on Saddam in the Shia village of Dujail in 1982 , after which more than 140 male villagers were killed .

2005-09-05,"Fema boss Michael Brown , in a starched white shirt , briefs President George Bush and other officials on Hurricane Katrina . 
Photograph : Jim Watson\/AFP\/Getty CVs always get a bit of a polish when you apply for a new job . 
That brief disastrous part-time role becomes valuable experience , points fall off the driving licence , and even the odd GCSE grade can get promoted . 
But the rest of us are n't even touching America 's disaster chief when it comes to chutzpah , writes David Fickling . 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency -LRB- Fema -RRB- director , Michael Brown , who was today taken off the job of overseeing the Hurricane Katrina relief effort amid criticism of his agency 's laggardly response to the disaster , spent most of his working life as a lawyer . 
So when it came to writing his official biography someone must have thought it would be a good idea to bung in something a bit more related to emergency management .

He writes : While it 's easy to dismiss the current Conservative leadership contest as little more than a political beauty contest , the race is about far more than a job title . 
The future of party policy is up for grabs and senior Tories are seizing on the opportunity to dump on policies they never liked in the first place . 
According to this morning 's Daily Telegraph , Andrew Lansley , the party 's cerebral shadow health secretary , wants to drop their `` patients ' passport '' policy , their idea of cutting waiting lists by letting patients use NHS money to subsidise private operations . 
While he never said so explicitly in a speech on Wednesday to the NHS confederation , there is little doubt about what he meant . 
He told his audience : `` It is most important to engage the public positively with choice and competition extended to everyone , than to be directed into a benefit for a minority . '' 
The point being that giving patients half the cost of a # 5,000 hip operation only helps if you can afford to fund the other half .

First , that while an evacuation order was given the only choice for those who could not leave , who were too frail or did not have cars , was to stay in their homes or a shelter . 
Second , that when evacuation buses were laid on there are several thousands who would not go . 
Presumably they do not want to leave the city and their possessions behind , or , amid the nightmarish toxic waters and rotting flesh , do not believe it can get any worse . 
For the second time this summer the first was in the Gaza Strip we are to see forced evacuations . 
Another international story , but this time intriguing rather than hard to understand , is the illness of Jacques Chirac . 
He left hospital today but , as Jon Henley will report in his World Dispatch there are allegations of a cover up over the state of his health .

If you are an undecided voter ahead of next week 's German election , there 's only one place to turn . 
So far more than 2 million Germans have already logged on to Wahl-O-Mat - an online guide to which party most corresponds with your views . 
Undecided voters have to answer a series of 30 questions . 
Some of them are overtly political : do you think , for example , that Germany 's strict dismissal protection laws should be relaxed ? 
Others are more general : should there be a speed limit on Germany 's autobahn , and should compulsory military service be abolished ? 
There is also foreign policy : do you agree that Turkey should be in the EU ? 
And drugs : should hashish should be legalised ? 
You can agree , disagree , say you are `` neutral '' or , if you are an inveterate fence-sitter - skip to the next question . 
At the end you click on `` result '' . 
Wahl-O-Mat lists the five parties in order , with the one most compatible with your views at the top . 
Founded in the Netherlands , Wahl-o-Mat was first used in Germany during the last election in 2002 , when some 3.6 million wavering voters logged on . 
It 's run by the Bundeszentrale f r politische Bildung -LRB- Federal Agency for Political Education -RRB- , an independent body . 
With record numbers of Germans still undecided this time , it could yet play a crucial role in determining whether Angela Merkel can put together a centre-right coalition , or is forced into a grand alliance with Gerhard Schr der 's SPD , as now seems likely . 
The results , of course , can be reassuring , surprising , dismaying , or baffling and may not coincide wih your own apparent preferences . 
When I tried it earlier this week , the Wahl-O-Mat told me I should vote for the Linkspartei , Germany 's new anti-business Left party , followed by the pro-business Liberal FDP , an unlikely pairing . 
Next came the Greens , followed by the SPD , with the CDU bottom - a result that surely refutes the claim made by some of you bloggers out there that I 'm some sort of CDU stooge . 
Anyone interested in German politics should give it a spin . 
There are many things that distinguish a Green party conference - opening today in the picturesque city of Lancaster - from the run-of-the-mill get-togethers of the big three parties . 
It is not just the pagan worship meetings -LRB- with them being held at dawn , this correspondent has yet to make it to one -RRB- , the recycling bins -LRB- it is embarrassing to consider how many forests must perish to provide journalists with printouts of speeches - most of which go straight in the bin - at the other three -RRB- or the number of small children happily galivanting around the conference floor as the looming environmental Armageddon is discussed from the podium -LRB- the Greens seem to be particularly fertile , as well as child-friendly -RRB- . 
What takes a little time to sink in , at least for the seasoned political anorak such as your correspondent , is what is n't here . 
There simply is n't any commercial or corporate sponsorship of the event . 
Continue reading ... A deeply shocking account by two paramedics stranded in New Orleans alleges that police lied to residents , saying buses were waiting to evacuate them - and then fired shots above their heads when they tried to reach them . 
It 's well worth reading in full , and gives the lie to claims that officials did all they could to help people escape the stricken city . 
Larrie Bradshaw and Lorrie Beth Slonsky were attending a conference in the city when the hurricane struck . 
Unable to find transport , they pooled money with around 500 people staying in the same hotel and paid $ 25,000 for buses to come and pick them up . 
`` We later learned that the minute they arrived at the city limits , they were commandeered by the military , '' the account says . 
Continue reading ... It is the debate that barely dare speak its name : should they rebuild ? 
Should they move it ? 
Several US commentators and the odd brave politician are starting to ask the questions , faced with the dizzying cost of rebuilding and fears over the low-lying city 's future vulnerability . 
Many evacuees have said they will not return . 
There may not be much evidence of people doing , as Barbara Bush put it , `` very well '' out of the disaster but it seems certain that many will make new lives elsewhere . 
A lot of the homes destroyed by Hurricane Katrina were not insured and the insurance payments for those that were could be spent anywhere . 
In today 's lead article on Slate , editor at large Jack Shafer argues that the city should not be rebuilt , and being careful to praise its history and people , lists its problems before Katrina hit : the old housing stock , the failing schools , the crime . 
Sure there will always be the higher-lying areas and the tourist-draw of the historic French Quarter , until a `` big one -LRB- new hurricane -RRB- hits '' , but he answers `` Do n't refloat '' , to the question of rebuilding . 
Shafer cites a professor in earth and sciences who says that New Orleans `` wants to be a lake '' and should never have been built in the first place . 
There is also at least one politician who has dared to question the pledges to rebuild : speaker of the House Dennis Hastert . 
He said in an interview that spending billions on a city that is below sea level `` does n't make sense to me '' , although he rowed back on the issue in a later statement . 
Other commentators have asked whether the city should be rebuilt on land less vulnerable to hurricanes and levee breaks . 
A New York Times piece entitled Putting Down New Roots on More Solid Ground said the city 's population had been declining anyway : down from a zenith in 1960 of some 630,000 people to around 445,000 in the last census . 
It is estimated that some 250,000 of the evacuees wo n't come back . 
The relief effort for Hurricane Katrina may have been slow getting off the ground - but internet scam artists have shown no lack of initiative , writes David Fickling . 
Fraudsters now see a major disaster as perfect bait to draw in the unwary : the aftermath of the south Asian tsunami saw dozens of such scams , and Katrina seems to have sparked even more . 
The FBI reports that more than 500 sites have been advertising Katrina relief services , with 300 established last Friday alone . 
Some are no doubt legitimate and sincere , but several have already been fingered for alleged illegal practice . 
Continue reading ... Until this week , there was little doubt who was going to win Germany 's general election the conservative leader Angela Merkel . 
Her Christian Democrat party -LRB- CDU -RRB- was comfortably ahead in the polls and would , it appeared , have little difficulty in putting together a centre-right government along with its coalition partner , the liberal Free Democrats -LRB- FDP -RRB- . 
The latest survey published by Forsa yesterday , however , suggests that , with 10 days to go , there are distinct signs of a late swing towards Gerhard Schrder 's Social Democrats . 
The poll shows the SPD up three points , to 34 % , with the Greens on 7 % and the new Left party on 8 % . 
While the CDU are still ahead on 42 % , the FDP is marooned on just 6 % . 
For the first time in weeks , Mrs Merkel 's conservative coalition has just 48 % , compared to 49 % for the left parties .

Continue reading ... The comments from Barbara Bush yesterday on how things are `` working very well '' for the `` underprivileged '' survivors of Hurricane Katrina are attracting a lot of interest on blogs today . 
After touring a relief center in Texas , the First Mother is reported to have told the Public Broadcasting Service : What I 'm hearing , which is sort of scary , is they all want to stay in Texas . 
Everyone is so overwhelmed by the hospitality . 
And so many of the people in the arena here , you know , were underprivileged anyway , so this is working very well for them . 
The American Flyer blog also pulls up the remarks below from Mrs Bush - which have something of a congruent tone - on Good Morning America in March 2003 about speculation in the media before the US-led invasion of Iraq on the scale of US fatalities . 
Why should we hear about body bags , and deaths , and how many , what day it 's gonna happen , and how many this or what do you suppose ? 
Oh , I mean , it 's not relevant . 
So why should I waste my beautiful mind on something like that ?

The millennium declaration provided a bold view of a better world , but we 're far from achieving the vision outlined five years ago . 
`` There is little cause for celebration '' , according to the UN 's Human Development Report released today , which describes meeting the goals as `` the single greatest challenge facing the development community - and arguably the world '' .

But what about the others ? 
Well , traveling down to Cottbus last week for a rally of the new Linkspartei - or Left party - I was astonished to hear the band afterwards break into 70s British glam rock . 
Not just any old glam rock , but The Sweet 's classic Blockbuster the first song I ever bought -LRB- you know , the one with the wailing police siren in it .

The secretary of state for work and pensions , who resigned from government last year after an investigation found he helped secure a visa for his former lover 's nanny , claims he did not grant his permission for the interview to be published . 
The interview , in which Mr Blunkett discussed his complex personal life , his political ambitions and the problems of coping with his disability , has gained widespread coverage in the media since it was published yesterday . 
The team surrounding the UN secretary-general , Kofi Annan , freely admits he has taken a battering over the last year , mainly because of the investigation into the Iraq oil-for-food program , writes Ewen MacAskill . 
When he set up the investigation in April last year , he can not have imagined that both he and the organization he serves would be so severely criticised in the report published today . 
He has been undermined mainly by the disclosures about the behavior of his son , Kojo , whose former employer Cotecna was one of the successful bidders for one of the Iraq contracts . 
In spite of the criticism , he says he is not planning to resign and intends to see out the remainder of his tenure , due to end in December next year . 
But the investigation has left him weak and vulnerable . 
The UN summit next week , the biggest-ever meeting of world leaders , was supposed to be the high point of his stewardship of the UN as world leaders commit to meeting targets for poverty reduction and universal primary education for all . 
Instead , the summit will end up diluting the final document , mainly at the behest of the US , which opposes the financing of the development targets , objecting even to the term `` millennium development goals '' .

No wonder Mr Annan said he wished the UN had never been given the program . 
But it was and the UN did not cover itself in glory during the $ 61bn -LRB- # 33bn -RRB- project , one of the UN 's biggest operations ever .

If the health of a democracy can be judged by the number of posters around at election time , then German democracy is in good shape . 
But with 12 days to go until Germans go to the polls in the September 18 election , which party has the best poster ? 
My favorite by a mile is the poster of the Linkspartei , Germany 's new left party , featuring the party 's two star candidates Oskar Lafontaine and Gregor Gysi . 
Both men are wearing suits and smiling . 
Oskar is on the left , Gregor on the right . 
But hang on a minute . 
Look closely and you notice that Gysi is considerably smaller than Oskar - and looks a bit like a Roman slave gazing adoringly at his master .

Angela Merkel and Gerhard Schrder shake hands after the debate . 
Photograph : AP\/RTL It was the biggest TV event since Germany lost to Brazil in the 2002 World Cup final . 
Some 20 million Germans tuned in to watch the only debate of the German election campaign between the chancellor Gerhard Schr der and his conservative challenger Angela Merkel . 
But who actually won ? 
Well , if you believe the polls conducted immediately after the gripping 90-minute clash it was a clear victory for Gerd as Schr der 's friends call him . 
According to a poll for ZDF television , some 48 % of viewers believed Schr der was the winner , while only 28 % thought Merkel had triumphed . 
And among undecided voters his figures were even better , with 58 per saying that Gerd had won , compared to only 16 % for Angie . 
At first glance the result seems baffling not least given that most journalists -LRB- including this one -RRB- thought Frau Merkel got the better of her rival . 
She seemed quicker than Schr der , superior when it came to detail and even made a joke . 
Tony Blair today apologised to Britons caught up in Hurricane Katrina who said they felt `` abandoned '' by by the Foreign Office . 
Today we 'll be contacting Gary Younge in New Orleans for an audio dispatch from the empty , ruined city , which he described in this piece in today 's Guardian . 
We 'll also be updating our list of blogs covering the aftermath of the tragedy . 
Mr Blair 's comments came during a visit to China , where he later held talks with President Hu Jintao in his capacity as holder of the rotating EU presidency . 
Also in China , there are conflicting reports over whether the EU and China have in fact reached a deal to end the so-called `` bra wars '' . 
In Indonesia , at least 117 people died today when an aircraft crashed into a crowded residential area in the city of Medan shortly after takeoff . 
And here on Newsblog we 'll have the first of Berlin correspondent Luke Harding 's daily dispatches ahead of the German election in two weeks ' time .

2005-09-05,"US presidents stay in the White House for eight years if they are lucky . 
Even then , their power wanes considerably in their second term as George Bush is finding out . 
The Iraq war has gnawed away at his popularity while Hurricane Katrina has savaged his reputation as much as it has ravaged New Orleans . 
But suddenly , Bush has been presented with an opportunity that most presidents can only dream of . 
With the death of the highly conservative chief justice William Rehnquist just days before Senate confirmation hearings for John Roberts , Bush can nominate a second judge to the supreme court . 
No sitting justice has died while in office in more than 50 years , and no president has installed two newcomers to the court at the same time since 1971 , when Richard Nixon appointed Rehnquist to fill one of a pair of vacancies . 
For Bush , the situation represents a rare chance to try and shape the court in his own conservative image and leave his most lasting legacy on America . 
It is also an opportunity to claw back the political initiative . 
Bush has already nominated John Roberts to succeed Rehnquist as America 's top judge , a decisive act that contrasted sharply with the dithering after Katrina . 
With the Roberts vetting process well advanced and his confirmation generating little opposition , such a shift could guarantee that a chief justice would be in place when the court opens its term early next month to consider important cases on abortion , assisted suicide and antitrust . 
Although presidents like to nominate justices that they think reflect their political leanings , it can be very hit and miss . 
Appointed chief justice in 1953 , Earl Warren turned out to be much more liberal than expected . 
He was involved in several landmark decisions including Brown v. Board of Education , which overturned the segregation of public schools ; the `` one man one vote '' cases of 1962-1964 , which dramatically altered the relative power of rural regions in many states ; and Hernandez v. Texas , which gave Mexican-Americans the right to serve on juries . 
Warren Burger , appointed chief justice by Richard Nixon in 1969 , also disappointed conservatives . 
Burger did not move to oveturn the major decisions of the Warren court and in the most controversial ruling of his term , Roe v. Wade , Burger voted with the majority to recognize the right to abortion . 
More recently , Justice Anthony Kennedy , who was appointed by Ronald Reagan , has pushed the court to defend homosexuality and abolish the juvenile death penalty . 
In recent years , the court was evenly balanced between liberals and conservatives , often ruling 5-4 on important cases . 
But if Bush has his way , the court could take a decisive shift to the right .

2005-09-06,"Tuesday 6 September 2005 01.48 BST Kofi Annan , the UN secretary general , expressed regret last night that the organization had ever become involved in the Iraq oil-for-food program . 
An investigation into the program is due to be published tomorrow , with Mr Annan expected to be criticised for poor management . 
In an interview with the BBC World Service Mr Annan , who is in London , said : `` Honestly I wish we were never given that program , and I wish the UN would never be asked to take that kind of a program again . '' 
The oil-for-food program was set up in 1996 to alleviate the impact of UN sanctions on Iraq by allowing Saddam Hussein to swap oil for food . 
The security council asked the UN to run it . 
But it was abused , mainly by Saddam , who is alleged to have used part of the revenues to buy influence . 
A senior UN official , Benon Sevan , is accused of corruptly receiving # 83,000 to help to facilitate an oil deal . 
Mr Annan ordered an inquiry into the affair last year , headed by Paul Volcker , the former head of the US Federal Reserve , who has released a series of interim reports that have damaged the reputation of the secretary general . 
Mr Annan has suffered from disclosures about the role of his son , Kojo , whose company secured one of the oil-for-food contracts . 
UN sources predict the report will focus more on Mr Annan 's management than his son . 
Mr Annan , who met Mr Volcker in New York last week , said : `` I suspect that there will be lots of criticism for myself as chief admin officer , probably something on the 661 committee -LRB- which ran the program -RRB- , the security council , the government of Iraq . 
When it comes to Iraq on this issue , no one is ... covered in glory . '' 
Mr Annan angered the US and Britain last year when , during a BBC interview , he declared the Iraq war illegal . 
The British government will not welcome his view , expressed last night , that the war has alienated Muslims and that Iraq has become a bigger base for terrorists than Afghanistan under the Taliban .

2005-09-07,"Rebuilding may cost as much as war in Iraq New Orleans Roads , sewers and pipes will have to be replaced as draining of city reveals huge task Wednesday 7 September 2005 00.21 BST A soldier stands guard as a fire burns near downtown New Orleans . 
Photograph : Chris Hondros\/Getty Engineers in New Orleans face an unprecedented rebuilding program as operations to pump water out of the flooded city began yesterday . 
Flood levels in some areas were said to have dropped by a foot after army engineers plugged a major gap in the levees . 
Yesterday it emerged that many of the roads , sewers and pipes carrying water and gas will have to be replaced and that contamination by sewage and toxic chemicals could mean some areas of the city have to be rebuilt completely . 
Hugh Kaufman , senior policy analyst for emergency response at the Environmental Protection Agency , said New Orleans may need one of the largest public building programs ever seen in the US at a cost of $ 80-100bn - approximately the same as the yearly cost of the war in Iraq . 
`` You have to repair and rebuild the sewage treatment plant and sewer infrastructure , as well as the drinking water infrastructure . 
`` You 're talking about a massive public works program of rebuilding that I do n't think we 've seen in this country before . 
We 're talking about like how much money we 're putting into Iraq , '' said Mr Kaufman , who worked on the clean-up of New York after the terrorist attacks of September 11 . 
`` You have a large amount of hazardous materials . 
Industrial discharges to the sewers have now been released . 
Sewage that would go into the sewers and into wastewater treatment plants , all of that is being released . 
`` You have oil and gas from gasoline stations , and waste oils that have been released . 
You 've got household hazardous materials , you 've got pesticides , you 've got chemicals , '' he said . 
Gordon Masterton , of the UK 's Institution of Civil Engineers , said : `` I 'm very pessimistic . 
The ground below New Orleans is very absorbent , like a sponge , and soaked in water that sponge will have swelled up in uneven ways . 
When they pump the water out again the sponge will contract , so there 'll be quite a lot of movement in road surfaces , water pipes , gas pipes and sewer pipes . 
I would expect quite a lot of damage to those . '' 
Lt Gen Carl Strock , commander of the Army Corps of Engineers , which is responsible for the city 's flood defences , said that one of the two major breaches in the levee system had been plugged and the other should be fixed later today . 
`` Once we seal those two places , that should stop the water from going in , '' he said . 
`` Our real focus right now is getting the flow stopped so we can get in and drain the city . '' 
Telephone company BellSouth Corp estimated it would cost $ 400-600m and take up to six months to repair the damage in the hardest-hit areas of New Orleans and the Gulf coast of Mississippi . 
Putting the electricity back on presents one of the greatest headaches . 
Entergy , the New Orleans utility company , yesterday said technicians still could not get near equipment to determine its status . 
It said its underground system was designed to survive submerging but , above ground , equipment such as electronic controls and transformers had been damaged . 
Every building would have to be checked before the electricity was brought back on , said a spokesman . 
Experts said some buildings may be so heavily contaminated with sewage and toxic chemicals that it may be necessary to rebuild much of the city . 
`` The toxic soup is touching every square inch of the flooded areas , '' said Paul Farmer , director of the American Planning Association . 
`` The environmental clean-up is one that we have not typically faced with other disasters . 
`` It 's not just the structural integrity of the buildings , but it 's the whole issue of contamination : contamination of buildings , contamination of yards , '' he said . 
There are 22 large-scale pumps used by city engineers to keep the streets of the low-lying city dry when it rains . 
They could be used in the operation once enough water has been removed and their electrics replaced . 
Concrete and steel offices should survive relatively unscathed , though smaller-scale buildings , such as houses , may have to be rebuilt . 
The sodden ground makes them liable to subsidence , and submerged plaster , mortar and timber will need to be replaced .

2005-09-12,"During the past century the United States has faced two brutal assaults . 
Within four years of the first , on December 7 1941 , the US and its allies had mobilised , taken on and defeated two powerful enemies , Japan and Germany . 
Four years after the second , on September 11 2001 , what real progress can the US and its allies honestly claim for the war on terror ? 
The answer , tragically and alarmingly , is that they have not made enough . 
Not only is terror very much still with us , it is also on the increase . 
Last year , the US state department reported 651 `` significant terrorist attacks '' around the world , three times the total for 2003 and the highest annual number since Washington began to collect such statistics two decades ago . 
Around a third of those attacks took place in Iraq , supposedly the central front of the war on terror , in some parts of which terrorist killings have now reached pandemic levels . 
Since April , more than 4,000 Iraqis have been killed by terrorists in Baghdad alone . 
But the killing is in no way confined to Iraq . 
No one in London needs any reminder of that . 
And Britain , like the US and many others , is wrestling to balance established liberties and ways of life with the danger that another 9\/11 , or another 7\/7 , may occur at any time . 
The assault on America four years ago this week was in every way as infamous a deed as the one committed by Japan in 1941 . 
Much of the response to it , however , was not just ineffective but counter-productive . 
Faced with 9\/11 , George Bush 's initial response was briefly both brainy and belligerent . 
But the initial advantages were quickly squandered under pressure from the ideological right . 
By choosing to rid the world of evil - above all in Iraq - rather than to hunt down , take out and politically disable al-Qaida , Mr Bush set his country on a path which continues to dismay America 's friends and to delight its enemies . 
In effect , though , he also did Osama bin Laden 's job for him . 
The war on terror , with its rhetoric of a battle between good and evil and its talk of a fight that will last for generations , depended for credibility upon the efficacy of American power and upon the accuracy of the US neocon prescription of a `` democratic revolution '' across the Middle East . 
In reality , both have proved to be wishful thinking - the real surprise being the limits of the US military effort . 
America has fought and occupied , but it has not shown that it can rebuild . 
The idea that Iraq would set off a domino democratic effect across the Middle East now seems even more preposterous than ever - if Iraq is exporting anything to its neighbors , it is violence not democracy . 
Faced with a ruthless insurgency , American public opinion is faltering as the gulf on the ground between reality and objectives widens . 
Post-Katrina , the question is not whether the US will begin to withdraw - but when , how and , above all , with what damage . 
Politically this may be inevitable and even desirable - but we will all live with the consequences . 
The most damning charge against the war on terror is that it has been a recruiting sergeant for the very forces it sought to destroy . 
As Mark Danner put it in the New York Times yesterday , Mr Bush 's failure to focus on al-Qaida has created a global `` al-Qaidaism '' of the kind that struck this country on July 7 . 
Such al-Qaidaism is not going to go away . 
If the earlier generation could produce a 9\/11 in the face of American power , what will the next generation produce in the wake of the American weakness inseparable from an Iraq withdrawal ? 
Bin Laden 's organization may have been damaged and disrupted since 2001 , and his dreadful cause may in many places be in the hands of amateurs , but he could never have dreamed that the world four years after the twin towers would look so favourable to his objectives .

2005-09-12,"Journalists believe recent deaths and injuries among their number based in Iraq show US troops are getting out of control It was a routine assignment that , like too many in Iraq , went wrong . 
Tipped off that police had clashed with gunmen in western Baghdad , the Reuters news agency dispatched Haider Kadhem , a cameraman , and Waleed Khaled , a soundman , to the scene . 
As their car headed down Ghaziliya bridge American troops opened fire , hitting Khaled in the face and the chest , killing him instantly and spattering blood over the US military and Reuters press cards clipped to his shirt . 
By the time relatives and colleagues arrived American armored vehicles had sealed off the street and Kadhem , slightly wounded from fragments , was under arrest . 
Having found nothing suspicious the troops allowed the car to be towed away and handed relatives a body bag . 
One soldier told them not to look too closely at the corpse . 
`` Do n't bother . 
It 's not worth it . '' 
Other soldiers standing a few feet away joked among themselves . 
For Reuters and many other foreign media organizations in Baghdad the August 28 shooting was further evidence that American troops are out of control . 
Since the 2003 invasion US forces have killed at least 18 media workers in incidents for which no one has been charged or punished . 
There have been no satisfactory investigations that we know of , '' said Rodney Pinder , director of the International News Safety Institute -LRB- INSI -RRB- , a Brussels-based advocacy group . 
Angry and frustrated , several radio and television networks , agencies and newspapers , including the Guardian , met last week to chart a joint response to the crisis . 
The gathering agreed to form a foreign correspondents ' association and to jointly lobby the US military and state department . 
More journalists have been killed in Iraq in two years than during the 20 years of conflict in Vietnam , according to Reporters Without Borders . 
It counted 66 dead in Iraq compared to 63 in Vietnam and 49 in the former Yugoslavia between 1991 and 1995 . 
INSI estimates the Iraq toll at 81 while the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists reckons 74 . 
Insurgents killed most and with few exceptions , such as the Italian Enzo Baldoni , the victims were Iraqis . 
Foreign journalists , based in fortified hotels or compounds , can move discreetly around the capital and accompany coalition troops on missions but they routinely rely on Iraqi colleagues for on the ground reporting . 
Increasingly US forces pose the graver threat . 
`` It is becoming impossible for us in good conscience to send out reporters to gather information because we do n't know what will happen to them , '' says Richard Engel , a correspondent for the US television network NBC . 
If something goes wrong , he says , `` we do n't know what procedures if any exist to follow up . '' 
The International Federation of Journalists accused the US military of `` incompetence , reckless soldiering , and cynical disregard '' for journalists ' lives . 
The Committee to Protect Journalists said there appeared to be official `` indifference '' to reporters ' deaths . 
In addition to shooting them , US forces have a habit of detaining journalists without charge . 
Weeks can pass before a bureau is able to confirm that an employee has been arrested , possibly injured , and held incommunicado in Abu Ghraib or another prison . 
A driver for the Guardian , accredited with the US authorities , was held without explanation for five days . 
At stake is not only the existence of independent media , says Alastair Macdonald , Reuters ' Baghdad bureau chief , but the credibility of US claims to be fostering democracy . 
`` The American ambassador recently called us the fourth estate , a pillar of the democracy , but we 're not being allowed to do our job here . '' 
When the US military detains employees media organizations try to sort it out privately , going through regular channels , appealing to the relevant major or colonel , until it dawns that this does not work . 
Asked at a recent press conference if there was a special policy for journalists , a handful of the 10,000 US-held detainees , Major General Rick Lynch , a US military spokesman , was blunt : `` That 's a no. . 
What we 've got to do is look at the individual that was indeed detained and what was he doing , regardless of what his profession is . '' 
Many correspondents say the fundamental problem is that US forces do not recognize the media 's right to work in Iraq . 
Almost every single Iraqi stringer in Mosul , a volatile northern city , has been arrested , including a freelance cameraman for CBS who was shot in April and has been detained since without charge . 
Investigations into shootings are conducted by an officer from the unit which opened fire . 
Invariably shooters are exonerated and victims deemed at least partly culpable . 
Waleed Khaled 's case was typical . 
A three-day investigation concluded the 35-year-old Reuters soundman was driving fast , stopped , immediately reversed and that he or Haider Kadhem , the cameraman , leaned out with what appeared to be a weapon . 
`` Our soldiers on the scene , using established rules of engage-ment and all the training received , decided that it was appropriate to engage that particular car . '' 
In other words the popular , jokey newsroom presence , the husband of a pregnant wife , the father of a four-year-old girl , brought it on himself . 
His colleague Kadhem , 24 , was released without charge after three days of questioning about `` inconsistencies '' in his story . 
US military spokesmen often cite `` strong evidence '' that an arrested Iraqi was an insurgent who used his work as cover . 
Despite astonishing allegations - including the shooting down of a helicopter by three journalists - no proof has emerged publicly . 
Hardly a surprise given that the legal process is secret and reports are not published . 
A smear or not , hinting at evidence can intimidate an employer less than 100 % sure about a stringer 's background . 
`` They make you ask yourself if you really want to bat for this guy , '' says one bureau chief . 
Such tactics contrast with the military 's warm embrace of those who `` embed '' , a well-oiled , largely transparent system which allows journalists to attach themselves limpet-like to troops . 
Everything is on the record and what you file , though monitored once published or broadcast , is uncensored . 
The openness and access -LRB- not to mention the food -RRB- tends to be better than the more controlled British version . 
There is no consensus on why there is such hostility to independent media . 
Some think it reflects the clumsiness of an army wrestling with a complicated guerrilla campaign . 
Insurgent cameramen do accompany gunmen and film attacks which end up on the internet . 
When a television crew arrives during or immediately after a fight troops often suspect the crew knew in advance . 
An urban myth , say the networks , but a dangerous one when even an established name like CNN is branded the Communist News Network . 
There is scant evidence that US troops deliberately target the press , unlike Israeli soldiers in the West Bank and Gaza . 
But commanders who view Iraq as an information war have an interest in blocking images they deem damaging . 
In a rare cracking of the opaque military Phillip Robertson , a reporter for the online magazine Salon.com , found the sniper who shot his friend Yasser Salihee , an Iraqi employee of the Knight-Ridder newspaper group . 
Salihee died instantly when a bullet entered his right eye as he drove towards a checkpoint in Baghdad in June . 
Named only as Joe , the sniper said his unit was braced for a suicide bomber and that the car appeared suspicious . 
Joe was troubled by the feeling that his victim was not an insurgent . 
`` I really hope he was a bad guy . 
Do you know anything about him ? '' 
"
2005-09-15,"George Galloway , the British MP and anti-war campaigner , was labeled a `` disgrace '' last night by pro-war journalist Christopher Hitchens , who was himself branded by Mr Galloway as a `` slug '' leaving a `` trail of slime '' . 
The two rhetorical heavyweights clashed in a rousing debate on Iraq in New York , both landing painful political blows among the insults , although Mr Galloway , Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow , came unstuck when he referred to the September 11 attacks . 
Mr Hitchens , the British Vanity Fair columnist who has strayed from his left-wing roots , began by imagining what would have happened had the policies of the `` so-called anti-war movement '' been followed over the last 15 years . 
`` Saddam Hussein would be the owner and occupier of Kuwait . 
He would have succeeded in the annexation - not merely the invasion - but the abolition of an Arab and Muslim state that was a member of the Arab League and of the United Nations . 
And with these resources , as we now know , because he lost that war , he was attempting to equip himself with the most terrifying arsenal that it was possible for him to ... '' Mr Hitchens was unable to finish as a comment from Mr Galloway drowned him out . 
Mr Hitchens gave short shrift to the incident on which Mr Galloway 's reputation principally rests in the US , his famous - or infamous - visit to the US Senate this May , during which he put the anti-war case with a forceful , and , for US politicians , somewhat unaccustomed , lack of deference . 
`` It is a disgrace that a member of the British House of Commons should go before the United States Senate sub-committee and not testify , but decline to testify , and to insult all those who tried to ask him questions with the most violent , cheap , guttersnipe abuse . 
I think that 's a disgrace , '' Mr Hitchens said , to cheers from the 1,000-strong crowd . 
Mr Galloway used colorful language of his own . 
To laughter and applause , he brought up Mr Hitchens 's support for the 1991 Gulf war , noting : `` What you have witnessed since then is something unique in natural history : the first ever metamorphosis from a butterfly back into a slug . 
I mention ` slug ' purposefully , because the one thing a slug does leave behind it is a trial of slime . '' 
But Hitchens claimed that he had simply changed his mind . 
`` I might not have been invited here in this battle of the titans if it was n't tolerably well known that I think I was probably mistaken on that occasion . '' 
And he took issue with Mr Galloway 's anti-war credentials . 
`` To hear him speak you would think - would you not ? 
- that he was a pacifist , that he defines himself as anti-war . 
Now how can this be said in good conscience by someone who has just , standing by the side of the dictator of Syria on the 30th of July , referred to the 154 heroic operations conducted in Iraq by the so-called resistance ? '' 
Mr Galloway 's comments following his visit to Syria were among his most controversial . 
He told al-Jazeera : `` The Iraqi resistance is not just defending Iraq . 
They are defending all the Arabs and they are defending all the people of the world from American hegemony . '' 
He added , speaking to Arab News Broadcasting : `` Most of the operations which they carry out are against the occupying forces and their collaborators and this is normal in every liberation struggle . '' 
And he told Syrian television : `` Two of your beautiful daughters are in the hands of foreigners : Jerusalem and Baghdad . 
The foreigners are doing to your daughters as they will . 
The daughters are crying for help and the Arab world is silent . 
Some of them are collaborating with the rape of these two beautiful Arab daughters . 
Because they are too weak and too corrupt to do anything about it . '' 
Mr Galloway stirred the crowd when he brought up the case of Cindy Sheehan , the anti-war protestor whose son died in Iraq last year and who has become the focus of fierce debate in the US . 
Repeating Mr Hitchens ' scathing criticisms of Ms Sheehan , Mr Galloway said : `` You are covered in the stuff you like to smear onto others . 
Not just me ... but people much more gentle than me , people like Cindy Sheehan ... who gave the life of her son for the war that you have come here to glory in . '' 
Referring again to the Syria episode , Mr Hitchens asked : `` Is it not rather revolting to appear in Damascus by the side of -LRB- Bashar al - -RRB- Assad -LRB- the Syrian president -RRB- and to praise the people who killed Casey Sheehan , and then to come to America and appeal to the emotions of his mother ? '' 
But Mr Galloway hit the wrong note with his comments on September 11 . 
`` You may think that those aeroplanes in this city on 9\/11 came out of a clear , blue sky . 
I believe they emerged out of a swamp of hatred created by us . '' 
A crescendo of booing cut him off as he continued to speak , and Mr Hitchens commented : `` Mr Galloway , you picked the wrong city to say that in , and arguably the wrong month , as well . '' 
After the debate , Mr Galloway told Radio 4 's James Naughtie : `` I think it 's amazing that so many people came and so many people were turned away , so much interest in two British guys debating Iraq in New York . 
There do n't appear to be figures in the American anti-war movement and in the American pro-war movement that are able to draw an audience , so maybe we 'll have to take this show to the west coast , I do n't know . '' 
But Mr Hitchens said he was `` depressed by the ease with which a cheap point can get applause in the mouth of a really unscrupulous person . 
When I turned my head - which I tried not to do - it was like looking straight into the piggy eyes of fascism . '' 
Mr Galloway is on a speaking tour of America to promote his new book about the Senate hearings , Mr Galloway Goes to Washington .

2005-09-15,"A scene from Mike Mackey 's Liberality for All . 
Photograph : Mike Mackey\/ACC Studios What would a world run by antiwar liberals look like ? 
That 's the premise of a new comic book , Liberality for All , set in an alternate future in which Al Gore won the 2000 US election and liberals went on to create a dystopia where a corrupt UN , led by the French president , Jacques Chirac , has appeased Islamist fundamentalists and invited Osama bin Laden to give the memorial address on the 20 anniversary of the September 11 attacks . 
Needless to say , the comic 's author , Mike Mackey , is a conservative fed up with liberal protests against the war in Iraq . 
In his story , Chelsea Clinton is the president , Michael Moore is vice-president and the Department of Political Correctness has curtailed freedom of speech . 
It 's up to a trio of neo-con cyborg superheroes , including Oliver North , to free the US from `` ultraliberal extremism '' . 
The series opens with the heroes attempting to stop Bin Laden - who has been appointed the UN 's Afghan ambassador - from detonating a nuclear bomb at the September 11 memorial service . 
The nuke has come courtesy of Saddam Hussein 's son , Uday , who is now the president of Iraq because the liberal Gore government did n't have the balls to invade the country . 
Tasteless , tacky - or just a wind up designed to push people 's buttons ? 
Online previews of Liberality , published next month , have provoked both outrage and praise on blogs and internet talkboards , with posters divided over whether it is neo-con propaganda or a send up of rightwing fears . 
Mackey , a 37-year-old comic book dealer from Kentucky -LRB- `` what Michael Moore refers to as Jesus Land '' -RRB- , says he wrote the book partly in response to the liberal view that the occupation of Iraq was misguided . 
`` One thing that embodies liberalism for me is that bumper sticker saying ` war is not the answer ' . 
The idea is war is never the answer . 
Well , there were 17 UN resolutions on Iraq . 
What would have been enough before taking action - 25 , 40 ? 
So the book imagines the consequences of not going to war . '' 
Does he consider the antiwar movement unpatriotic ? 
`` I hear people on the left saying ` do n't question my patriotism ' - but you do n't see a -LRB- US -RRB- flag in sight at the antiwar protests , '' he says . 
Unsurprisingly , Mackey 's own assessment of the occupation is at odds with that presented in most of the world 's media - bar , perhaps , Fox News . 
`` It 's going fantastically well in a way that 's not being reported in the news , '' he says . 
`` I understand 3,000 schools have been built and women have the right to vote and not to be raped by Uday Hussein . '' 
Given his views , I ask him whether he 's concerned about being interviewed by a liberal website like Guardian Unlimited ? 
`` You 're liberal ? 
That 's not what I 'd heard , '' he says . 
`` A friend of mine said you were like Fox News on the web . 
Maybe it was Sky News . '' 
I suddenly imagine the sound of my editor-in-chief choking on her lunch . 
Some critics argue that Liberality is so far-fetched it does n't work as satire . 
Given her father 's shenanigans while in office , would Chelsea really be likely to want to go back to the Oval Office ? 
`` She 's a moderate in the book . 
I think she 's a sympathetic character , '' he says . 
Mackey admits it was `` almost too ridiculous to use him '' until he saw Moore sitting in the place of honor next to Jimmy Carter at the Democratic party national convention during the US election campaign . 
`` Then it almost became dangerously prophetic , '' he says . 
`` But the book 's meant to be fun . 
It 's not propaganda . 
It 's not like I 've made a movie and called it a documentary like Michael Moore did . '' 
The furore has attracted coverage from newspapers including the Boston Globe and talk radio , helping the Liberality website notch up 500.000 hits in two months . 
Not bad for a self-published comic with a print run of just 10,000 copies . 
It 's doubtful Mackey will find a big audience outside the US , though . 
UK readers are probably aware of Oliver North , given his involvement in the covert sale of arms to Iran during the Reagan administration . 
But would they recognize his other two heroes ? 
Maybe a few will recall G Gordon Liddy , who was involved in the Watergate break-in that led to Richard Nixon 's resignation , but Sean Hannity , a rightwing talk show host , is unheard outside of the US . 
Comics , in London , have ordered just one copy - and only out of morbid curiousity . 
But we Brits should perhaps be grateful we come off lightly in this nightmare vision of the future . 
The UK is noticeably absent from the countries applauding Bin Laden 's UN address in the first issue . 
`` That was me tipping my hat to you guys , '' Mackey says . 
`` I 've got a lot of time for Tony Blair . 
I tried to envisage where the UK was in my reality . 
I think the British government would be very conservative . '' 
Perhaps Liberality is n't so far-fetched after all . 
"
2005-09-16,"Friday 16 September 2005 11.24 BST Like a boxer bigging himself up before a fight , George Galloway said that he was not in the slightest bit nervous about his forthcoming debate with Christopher Hitchens on whether the Iraq war was justified and necessary . 
`` He 's all washed up , like Sonny Liston , '' said the MP for Bethnal Green and Bow . 
But in his prime even Liston had attributes that would make his opponents tremble . 
`` He was the big black Negro in every white man 's hallway , waiting to do him in , '' wrote Amiri Baraka in praise of Liston . 
`` A heavy-faced replica of every whipped-up woogie in the world ... finally here to collect his pound of flesh . '' 
And so it was -LRB- melanin content notwithstanding -RRB- that Hitchens , who supports the war , stood outside Baruch College , looking for a hallway to lurk in . 
With just minutes to go he was still handing out leaflets denouncing Galloway . 
`` There 'll be no courtesies and no handshakes , '' said Hitchens , laying the ground rules for minimum civility . 
What had been billed as `` the grapple in the Big Apple '' in the end owed more to pugilism than polemics , with jibes , like jabs , missing more often than they landed , and many a blow below the belt . 
Hitchens berated Galloway for his `` sinister piffle '' , congratulating him on `` being 100 % consistent in -LRB- his -RRB- support for thugs and criminals '' and declaring : `` The man 's search for a Fatherland knows no ends . '' 
Galloway branded Hitchens a hypocrite and `` a jester at the court of the Bourbon Bushes '' . 
Describing Hitchens ' journey from the left to the right , Galloway said : `` What we have witnessed is something unique in natural history . 
It 's the first metamorphosis of a butterfly back into a slug . '' 
In the heat of battle the fact that butterflies come from caterpillars did not temper the applause from the audience , roughly two-thirds of whom backed Galloway . 
Having both torched the moral high ground , they would both later claim it as their own . 
At one point Galloway told Hitchens `` Your nose is growing , '' only to deride his opponent for his `` cheap demagoguery '' . 
Hitchens scolded the jeering audience for their `` zoo-like noises '' , only to say that Galloway 's `` vile and cheap guttersnipe abuse is a disgrace '' . 
In a debate that drew as much from the culture of the playground as the traditions of parliament , no hyperbolic stone was left unturned . 
In response to one of Galloway 's answers Hitchens said : `` Beneath each gutter there 's another gutter gurgling away . '' 
Galloway later shot back : `` You 've fallen out of the gutter into the sewer . '' 
When they last met , just before Galloway testified before the Senate in May , he called Hitchens a `` drink-sodden former Trotskyist popinjay '' . 
Hitchens replied `` You 're a real thug , are n't you ? '' 
Four months later , the level of debate did n't get much more sophisticated than that . 
If the tone was emblematic of the divisive rancor that has made public discourse in general , and the Iraqi debate in particular , so uncivil , the venue was equally symbolic . 
For when historians come to judge Wednesday 's event the first question they might ask is why in a city the size of New York , two British polemicists were needed to conduct it . 
The `` sold out '' sign on the doors of Baruch College spoke volumes about the thirst for open public debate on the issue , and the rarity of home-grown voices who might quench it . 
For a subject that is often discussed but seldom debated , the talent had to be imported . 
Hitchens , who has lived in the US for some time and acquired dual citizenship , occasionally interchanged `` I '' for `` we '' - meaning Americans . 
But this was a very British affair : the raucous knockabout of two men who both learned their craft at party conference fringe meetings , rather than setpiece primetime deliveries to televised party conventions . 
If there was light amid all this heat it shone not from their well-rehearsed and familiar arguments , but from their mis-steps . 
Galloway learned the hard way that four years after the attacks on the twin towers there are still some things you can not say about September 11 that are common currency in Britain just a few months after the July 7 bombings . 
`` You may believe they came out of a clear blue sky , '' he said to a chorus of boos and single-finger gestures . 
`` But they came out of a swamp of hatred created by us . '' 
Hitchens replied : `` You picked the wrong city to say that in , and the wrong month . '' 
But it was Hitchens who made the greater gaffe when he implied , to howls of disbelief , that race played no part in those who perished in Hurricane Katrina , and that George Bush could not have helped the victims because he was obstructed by state officials . 
At this point he might have taken his cue from Liston , who spat out his mouthpiece as the bell tolled for the seventh round against Muhammad Ali , declaring `` That 's it '' . 
But he soldiered on . 
Having lost the audience he then turned on them . 
`` I 'm just reminding you that you 're on telly , '' he said . 
`` I just hope your friends and relatives are n't watching . '' 
Galloway won on points . 
Sadly , by the end of the night , few could remember what the point was .

2005-09-16,"We must not be blackmailed by Merkel 's neoliberal gang Schr der 's government has made mistakes , but it is on the side of the disadvantaged and kept us out of an illegal war As hard as it will be to achieve this result in the German elections , I none the less make the case for the Social Democrat and Green coalition to continue in government under the chancellor , Gerhard Schrder , and the foreign minister , Joschka Fischer . 
Both have the courage to undertake difficult reforms ; both have demonstrated responsible behavior in the face of crises . 
Let us recall : four years ago the attack on the World Trade Centre shook America - and Germany . 
The chancellor promised the US unswerving support in the fight against terrorism - but he added a caveat that Germany would not get involved in military adventures . 
That warning proved all too necessary . 
Shortly afterwards , in the words of the US president , Iraq was declared the No 1 rogue state . 
America 's former ally , Saddam Hussein , became the devil incarnate . 
Based on the flimsy claim that nuclear weapons were being produced in Iraq , a war ensued that made victims of Iraq 's civilians and has not ended . 
We now know that the US deceived its allies , and some were led a merry dance into volunteering for war . 
The German government - whose predecessors were known for their unthinking allegiance - had the courage to speak out against the president of a superpower ; Willy Brandt would have described it as `` courage before a friend '' . 
Of course , the opposition CDU-CSU was horrified . 
How could the superpower be rebuked in such a foolhardy way ? 
The chancellor and foreign minister were not swayed . 
To this day , they have stood by this responsible decision and at the same time shown themselves to be loyal to the role of the UN . 
If the Stoiber-Merkel duo had won the last election , in 2002 , Germany and its soldiers would be embroiled in the war , suffering the consequences that the people of Iraq and every `` willing '' ally are enduring to this day . 
Angela Merkel still refuses to recognize her political misjudgment . 
To vote her into federal office would be reckless . 
And who would take over Fischer 's responsibility for foreign policy ? 
A joker named Guido Westerwelle -LRB- from the Free Democratic party , the CDU 's coalition partner -RRB- , for example ? 
Here we already have a party that , seeking to favor high earners , has submitted to the dogmas of neoliberalism . 
With lunatic plans for tax cuts it , along with the CDU , has cosied up to big business . 
Others have made mistakes , and I do not want to minimize the misjudgments that chancellor Schrder 's government has made . 
Promises made by employers were believed for too long ; considerable income-tax cuts resulted only in demands for further cuts ; profits are being pocketed , not invested in new jobs ; directors of banks and major industries are giving themselves fraudulently high salaries and payoffs - while demanding , often using blackmail , that workers go without wage rises . 
The permanent threat of job losses allows trade unions to be intimidated and the working population to be manipulated . 
The Social Democrats and Greens have given in to such pressure too often - in a manner that is detrimental to democracy . 
How will we get anywhere if groups outside parliament , such as the powerful pharmaceutical lobby , continue to influence legislation ? 
If this continues , injustices will accumulate . 
Let us hope it is not too late for the current government to recognize that the financial consequences of its reforms should no longer favor only the very wealthy , but need to be for the good of all parts of society . 
The FDP wants the highest rate of income tax to fall to 35 % . 
Then again , Paul Kirchhof , Frau Merkel 's wunderkind and her choice for finance minister , plans to outdo them with his neoliberal masterpiece of a 25 % flat-rate income tax for all . 
One can only hope that as many people as possible will recognize this swindle before he gets near government . 
Please do n't tell us that the big parties are all the same , and that there is no longer a left and a right . 
It is the Social Democrats and the Green party that stood up for employees ' rights against the Christian Democrats ' neoliberal obsession with redundancy . 
It is the Social Democrats that stood up for comprehensive schools . 
It is the CDU and CSU , on the other hand , that are always attempting to block the way to educational justice . 
It is the Greens ' admirably brave minister Renate Kunast who takes the farming lobby to task and is committed to protecting the consumer . 
It is the Greens and Social Democrats who imposed a nuclear ban and promoted renewable energy , creating new jobs . 
It is true that the initial move towards reform by the red-green coalition was full of mistakes . 
But they had the desire to learn from their errors . 
At the same time , the CDU made a point of badmouthing Germany , particularly from an economic standpoint . 
In parliament 's upper house , the CDU has been blocking a multitude of reforms . 
Its conduct as an opposition party has taken on a destructive nature . 
The only thing it is good at is complaining . 
Our country must not sink into self-pity nor lapse again into the stagnation of the Helmut Kohl era . 
More courage is needed to make essential changes , even those that may hurt . 
Thanks to new legislation , hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals have gained the possibility of German residency . 
They are an asset to our country , because their cultures contribute to the color and variety of our society . 
Only when their own cultures are respected will they be ready to recognize the enrichment they would get from the German culture and language . 
With this we come again to Schrder and Fischer . 
Both are capable of admitting mistakes and correcting them . 
Both are occasionally criticised for their arrogance . 
That 's all very well , but when one has drive and energy , and the other self-confidence , and both fearlessly handle the media , they deserve to survive . 
After all , it is thanks to their fierce determination that our soldiers escaped a war that was contrary to international law . 
Their actions reinforced Germany 's reputation abroad . 
I will vote for the red-green alliance because it protected us from war ; had the courage to face difficult reforms ; is on the side of the socially disadvantaged ; and will save us from descending into a US-style class system .

2005-09-18,"Lewis Lapham 's collection of journalism , Theater of War , shows he was right about Bush , the ` war on terror ' and Iraq . 
Being right is n't enough , says Peter Preston Here , in 20 graceful , witty , prophetic essays , is everything that 's good about American journalism -LRB- and a rich slice of American society , too -RRB- . 
The editor of Harper 's magazine writes like a dream , researches like a punctilious professor of classical history and finds his lonely judgments vindicated time and again . 
The difficulty - and it is a difficulty - is that that good side comes with a greyer side that readers outside America ca n't ignore , a built-in impotence verging on tragic irrelevance . 
But let 's hit the high spots first . 
We have Lapham , aged 10 , remembering the day America dropped a bomb on Hiroshima , the day Buckminster Fuller saw humanity begin ` taking its final exam ' . 
So , almost six decades on , the fear of a nuclear weapon brought into Manhattan ` does n't seem much different from the fear of a nuclear weapon delivered to the same address by a Soviet submarine 70 miles east of Nantucket ' . 
He did n't buy the ` war on terrorism ' . 
He did n't buy Iraq . 
He despised the phoney build-up to a phoney war as a cowed , blinkered media played dumb and Congress became the voice of the ` frightened rich ' . 
He scorned the White House 's crude propaganda . 
` In place of Hitler or Stalin , the American armies found the remnants of a dictator more accurately compared to a psychopathic prison warden , a brutal but almost comic figure . ' 
He was right on WMDs , right on the messy aftermath of invasion , right on the hollow rhetoric of Team Bush . 
Crucially , he is right about the theater of war , a melodrama that seemingly dooms the United States , century after century , to suppress its internal tensions because of some confected outside threat , to choose a ` war ' against terrorists , drug dealers or communist remnants rather than save the poor blacks of New Orleans -LRB- or collect their bodies weeks after the flood -RRB- . 
This is passionate stuff , triumphant in its foresight and nowhere reaching for the crutch of hindsight . 
So what 's the problem ? 
Simply , alas , that Lapham 's too infinitely erudite for his , or our , good . 
Washington 2005 as the Rome of two millenniums ago ? 
Quotes up front from Auden , Marlowe , Keats and Bertrand Russell ? 
Two paragraphs at the end of an essay on global warming and mankind 's fragility manage to mention Bach , Dachau , the altars of Poseidon , Elizabethan merchants buying French cannons , the thoughts of Loren Eiseley and memories of Cisalpine Gaul . 
Well , we all like to show off a bit . 
What 's the use of 70-plus years of high-minded education if you ca n't use it in your daily business ? 
Emperor Heraclius , Suleiman the Magnificent and Donald Rumsfeld march in step through these pages . 
But you can have too much of a sumptuously referenced thing and Lapham does n't know where to stop . 
The American public is n't as stupid as its political leaders suppose , he says . 
He has faith in their wisdom . 
And the case he makes about the tacky , self-serving nature of American democracy could n't be more dazzlingly argued . 
Time after time , current events bear him out . 
But why , then , does n't that triumph of analysis catch the wise electorate 's imagination to change policies and directions ? 
It 's not a hard question to answer . 
Because Joe Public is a bit blank about Suleiman the Magnificent . 
Because Lapham seems to be writing for a coterie of curled lips , mostly within 20 miles of Fifth Avenue . 
Because he makes no real effort to break out and move the hearts and minds that might move mountains . 
There 's a nice quote from the master about politicians being trained ` to know the taste of the boot polish ' , but Mencken preached in a broader church . 
Lapham sits with others in the side chapel of Gore Vidal . 
He mocks other journalists truckling to the corporations that own their minds and pens . 
He ca n't find a single recent President to admire . 
Not Kennedy , the ` spendthrift heir ' , not Carter , nor Clinton , never mind the burning Bushes . 
America 's voters do n't require ` presidential candidates to know where to look on the map for Zanzibar or Romania ' , apparently . 
` Lack of knowledge on the topics of foreign affairs is a proof of virtue . ' 
They airily waved George W through as he flubbered away . 
But sometimes , surely , it 's necessary for political writers to get serious about deadly serious politics . 
Sometimes , they have to make the connections that move the minds of the people who matter . 
One tragedy of America 's present predicament , to be sure , is a fourth estate too cowed or corporatised to challenge the money and power which shadow their existence . 
Here comes Halliburton , contracted rebuilder of New Orleans ; you 'd laugh if you were n't crying first . 
The friends of Cheney , supposed saviors of Baghdad , have risen to a new cash challenge . 
Yet where are the voices that could make a difference ? 
Fox News has such voices . 
They turn dodgy theses into reality by the rasping certainty of their repetition . 
The right shouts with a will and calls that winning the argument . 
America 's big city chain papers have a few dissenting voices , but balance them out so they are canceled out . 
Even the New York Times and the Washington Post have mumbled into their martinis these past five years . 
And the rest , if not silent , exist only in a few small corners of intellectual refinement sprayed lightly with contempt . 
Maybe New Orleans has swilled some of that caution and intellectual scorn away . 
Maybe the spectacle of so much poverty , so much black poverty , in a toxic backyard will flush out the corners of the salons . 
Do n't bet on it , though . 
The right has already found Mr Bush not guilty and waits for the worst of the shouting to die away . 
Is Louis Lapham an adornment to American journalism ? 
Is his critique of wars not worth the fighting perceptive and exhilarating ? 
Often better than that . 
Why , then , do he and his fellow sages sit on the peripheries of influence and concern under any administration , Democrat or Republican ? 
Because , in part , they choose to ; because the sidelines fit their sense of rectitude and superior self better . 
It 's a terrible shame .

2005-09-18,"Al-Qaeda 's slaughter has one aim : civil war 150 died in one day in Baghdad - and Iraqis , not foreign fighters , are now the insurgency 's keenest recruits . 
Peter Beaumont investigates how this crucial shift has changed the fight The unemployed gather like blown drifts where jobs are to be had . 
They queue around the block in weary , patient lines at barracks and police stations , clutching their identity papers . 
They queue to dig ditches or shovel rubbish from the streets , or gather in the early morning in dusty streets and squares where builders tout for labourers . 
Last week the bombers came to al-Uruba Square in Kadhimiya , a Shia area of Baghdad . 
With its vast , important , gold-domed mosque , it has been a favorite for the suicide bombers . 
On Wednesday the driver of a van , pretending to seek day labourers , called men to his vehicle . 
As they approached , he detonated 220 kilos of high explosives , killing 114 people and injuring 150 more . 
This was the beginning of one of Iraq 's bloodiest days , but , despite the carnage , far from its most murderous . 
In a series of bomb explosions and shootings , 150 people would lose their lives and 500 would be injured . 
It was followed by yesterday 's toll of 30 people killed and 38 wounded in a car bombing in Nahrwan , around 30 miles from Baghdad . 
Earlier in the day police in Baghdad found nine bodies shot in the head and chest in three separate incidents , while in Baquba one man died and 17 people , including three Iraqi soldiers , were wounded when a car driven by a suicide bomber exploded near an Iraqi army patrol . 
As officials of Iraq 's Shia-dominated government , including those at the overworked Institute of Forensic Medicine , study the aftermath of the latest bombings , it is with a new fear : that they will find the bomber was not a Syrian , Yemeni , Saudi or even a Briton , but a brother Iraqi recruited by al-Qaeda . 
A year ago analysis of the identities of suicide bombers deployed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi 's al-Qaeda in Iraq suggested the vast majority of suicide volunteers were foreign fighters smuggled across the Syrian border . 
A year on , the government , and its multinational allies , are confronting a shocking new reality : an emboldened and reinvigorated al-Qaeda that for the first time is attracting increasingly large numbers of young Iraqi Sunnis to its cause - and to die in suicide operations . 
Following a week in which Zarqawi ` declared total war ' on the country 's Shia majority after the co-ordinated series of attacks that began in Kadhimiya , British and American officials have admitted that there is growing evidence that al-Qaeda is strengthening its grip in Iraq . 
In the most alarming development , officials concede that for the first time that a significant number of suicide attacks in the country are now being undertaken by Iraqis . 
The recruitment of Iraqi suicide bombers by al-Qaeda comes at a time when Iraqi Sunnis also appear to be taking increasingly senior roles in al-Qaeda in their country , and at a time that the leadership and aims of the wider insurgency have become increasingly blurred . 
Some American officials have claimed that as much as half of Zarqawi 's organization is now Iraqi , but their British counterparts are more careful , admitting only that they are alarmed by the number of Iraqis volunteering to carry out suicide operations . 
` Everything points to the fact that Iraq has become the main point of effort for al - Qaeda now , ' said one British official . 
` There is evidence that al-Qaeda globally is sending human and financial resources to support the struggle in Iraq . ' 
What is not clear is the nature of the links between al-Qaeda 's current poster boy for international jihad and senior members of Osama bin Laden 's operation , and what role they are playing in the organization in Iraq , although some officials strongly suspect that they are involved . 
What has emerged is that al-Qaeda in Iraq has three explicit targets : to hurt the US and Britain on the ground ; to attack democracy ; and to attack Shias , whom they regard as schismatic apostates . 
` There is a feeling in al - Qaeda that Iraq is the springboard for their wider ambitions , ' said the official . 
` To that end they have upped their game in Iraq significantly in the last 12 months . ' 
That view is endorsed by a US official who told the Los Angeles Times last week : ` They are the best game in town , the most organised organization . ' 
What is doubly worrying for the US and Iraq is evidence that , where once even many Sunnis who actively supported the wider insurgency still regarded al-Qaeda and its tactics as deeply unpalatable , now - despite rejecting al-Qaeda 's vision of a return to a medieval caliphate - they are more willing to accept Zarqawi 's methods as a valid weapon in their struggle . 
The emerging picture of al-Qaeda and its operations is increasingly alarming Washington , London and Baghdad . 
Although few feel safe estimating the size of Zarqawi 's network , one places the hardcore of the organization as around 10 per cent of the total of Iraq 's insurgency , itself thought to command upwards of 20,000 committed fighters . 
By this account , Zarqawi 's organization would be between 1,000 and 2,000 in total , not including the suicide bombers who pass through its hands . 
At the head of the Iraq organization is Zarqawi and a series of key aides who co-ordinate strategy and logistics . 
Beyond this small , central group are locally com - manded al-Qaeda groups in major cities and areas of activity which are under the command of individual 'em irs ' . 
According to officials , each of these emirs , who are in charge of operations , logistics , finance and planning , is paired with a propaganda chief in charge of communicating al-Qaeda 's recruitment message to the local organizations . 
` Zarqawi 's organization is the most secretive operating in Iraq , and probably the best , ' said one British official . 
` For that reason , it has probably always looked bigger than it is . ' 
Yet the existence of such an effective terrorist organization , even if it is just a small part of the insurgency , has created another paradox that Western military and intelligence officials are grappling with : the willingness of Iraqis to fight where al-Qaeda is under assault . 
In Falluja , 40 miles west of Baghdad , and the northern city of Tal Afar ` what has been extraordinary on both occasions is the number of people who picked up weapons ' , said one official . 
` The orthodoxy had been to expect more resistance from the foreign fighters . ' 
One explanation for al-Qaeda 's new appeal to Iraqi fighters is supplied by Mowaffak Rubaie , Iraq 's national security adviser and a former Shia activist , who said last week that ` there 's no doubt ' that once-nationalistic elements of the insurgency were now drifting toward Zarqawi . 
` There 's a tendency to religionise the insurgency , ' he said . 
` Religion is a strong motive . 
You 're not going to find someone who 's going to die for Baathists . ' 
It is not only the apparent resilience of al-Qaeda in Iraq as an organization and its ability to replenish itself after setbacks that is worrying military and intelligence officials : the organization 's ability to refresh the ranks of its volunteers for suicide operations is also causing alarm . 
` What is striking , ' said one Whitehall analyst , ` is that a year ago al-Qaeda would have extravaganzas and then run out of suicide bombers , so there would be a lull . 
We had 11 on a single day last week . ' 
Iraqi and Western officials are not the only ones who are waking up to the new potential of al-Qaeda in Iraq . 
After two years and more of ignoring the problem , Iraq 's neighbors are now taking an urgent interest in the group 's ability to flourish , conscious that , after Iraq , their own regimes are in the crosshairs . 
If last week 's bombings were designed to deliver one message - the provocation of the Shias into a broadening civil conflict - Zarqawi 's declaration of total war , broadcast by al-Qaeda 's ` Jihad Media Battalion ' on the internet , had a different audience in mind . 
That audience was potential recruits , urging them to abandon moderate Sunni clerics in favor of al-Qaeda 's apocalyptic agenda . 
Describing the joint US-Iraqi assault on Tal Afar , Zarqawi sought to cast the Sunnis as victims of a vicious sectarian war . 
` Sunnis who managed to escape from the hell of the crusader bombing , ' claimed Zarqawi , ` were seized by the treacherous hands of the treacherous -LRB- Badr -RRB- corps and others , who abused and murdered the men and who desecrated the women 's honor and stole their jewellery and ornaments . 
` This is an organised sectarian war , whose details were carefully planned , against the will of those whose vision has been blinded and whose hearts have been hardened by Allah . 
` Beware , oh Sunni scholars - has your sons ' blood become so cheap in your eyes that you have sold it for a low price ? 
Has the honor of your women become so trivial in your eyes ? 
It is a declaration of war on Iraq 's Shias last week , Western officials fear , that has exploded in the middle of the rapidly souring relations between even those Sunnis and Shias who had previously sought to ignore the country 's sectarian differences . 
In the directness of its call to arms , it suggests an al-Qaeda in Iraq that is emboldened and far from worn down by the long months of war . 
It is this that is alarming US and UK intelligence officials most . 
The most frightening development of all is the way in which Sunni nationalist insurgent leaderships and al-Qaeda 's leaderships are growing closer in a number of areas . 
` There used to be a clear division in our minds between what we used to call `` terrorists '' and `` insurgents '' in Iraq , ' said the Whitehall official . 
` Now there is a blurring as these groups come closer together . ' 
From a political point of view , any closing of the gap between the wider insurgency and al-Qaeda is deeply problematic for the policy of trying to engage those insurgents who could be incorporated into Iraq 's political process , and thus isolating al - Qaeda and the hardliners . 
None of which is any consolation to the families of the dead labourers of Kadhimiya .

2005-09-18,"Tony Blair has denounced the BBC 's coverage of Hurricane Katrina as ` full of hatred of America ' and ` gloating ' at the country 's plight , it was reported yesterday . 
Blair allegedly made the remarks privately to Rupert Murdoch , chairman and chief executive of News Corporation , which owns the rival Sky News . 
The comments threatened a new rift between the government and the BBC following the Andrew Gilligan affair over events leading to the Iraq war and recent criticisms of ministers Today presenter John Humphrys , which were controversially leaked to the press . 
Downing Street said last night it had no comment on the report in the Financial Times . 
The BBC said that its coverage had been ` committed solely to relaying the events fully , accurately and impartially ' . 
Murdoch , a long-standing critic of the BBC , was addressing the Clinton Global Initiative conference in New York . 
Chuckling , he said : ' I probably should n't be telling you this ' before recounting a recent conversation with Blair . 
He said the Prime Minister was in New Delhi when he criticised BBC coverage of the catastrophe in New Orleans : ` He said it was just full of hatred of America and gloating at our troubles . ' 
Bill Clinton , the former US President who was hosting the conference , also attacked the tone of the BBC coverage at a seminar on the media . 
He said it had been ` stacked up ' to criticise the federal government 's slow response . 
Sir Howard Stringer , chief executive of Sony Corporation and a former head of CBS News , said he had been ` nervous about the slight level of gloating ' by the corporation . 
The disapproval will come as a blow to BBC executives , who had declared themselves delighted with the hurricane coverage , led by Matt Frei . 
They believed they had learned the lessons from the Boxing Day tsunami in Asia , when the BBC was regarded as being slow off the mark . 
Blair 's reported comments were strongly criticised last night by Martin Bell , the former BBC war correspondent and former MP . 
Bell said : ` Assuming it 's accurate - it may of course be that Tony Blair was simply telling Rupert Murdoch what he thought he wanted to hear . 
If he really does have a gripe with the BBC coverage , there is no shortage of forums in which he can say so publicly . 
But the last time he picked a fight with the BBC , as I recall , the government came off rather badly . ' 
He added : ' I think Matt Frei 's reporting was absolutely immaculate and reflected the fact that one of the things the BBC is there for is to report events as they happened rather than as politicians may want them perceived to have happened . 
If Tony Blair does want to confront the BBC over this , I 'd be surprised - because he would find absolutely zero support , except perhaps among his usual henchmen . ' 
Charles Wheeler , the veteran former US correspondent for the BBC , said : ' I do n't believe Murdoch actually said that . 
It does n't sound like Blair to me . 
The coverage I saw was extremely good and got better and better . 
Matt Frei was very good . 
He got quite angry , which is what might have annoyed people . ' 
I do n't see why people should be unemotional ; I never was . 
You have to tell people what you feel and what you hate - that 's part of legitimate reporting . ' 
A spokesman for the BBC said last night : ` We have received no complaint from Downing Street , so it would be remiss of us to comment on what is reported as a private conversation . '

2005-09-18,"New Yorkers queued around the block to see two British political heavyweights - writer Christopher Hitchens and MP George Galloway - square up over the war in Iraq . 
Andrew Anthony flew to america to take them both on ... Outside the Mason Hall in Gramercy Park , Manhattan , a long line of people stretched around the block as they queued for the sold-out showdown between Christopher Hitchens , the English journalist and essayist domiciled in America , and George Galloway , the Respect MP for Bethnal Green and Bow . 
Billed as the Grapple in the Big Apple , this two-Brit debate on the Iraq war had galvanised and divided New York 's political classes in a manner that perhaps no native orators could achieve . 
For fans of a certain kind of muscular polemic , Hitchens v Galloway was the equivalent of an historic heavyweight prize fight . 
Indeed , so oversubscribed was the event that some were suggesting , not entirely in jest , that it should have been moved to Madison Square Garden , scene of countless boxing epics . 
As it was , in the more claustrophobic setting of a community college , tempers were running high . 
` This country is the most evil empire the world has ever known , ' announced Bill Mann , a short stocky man with a flat nose and a Brooklyn accent that made Tony Curtis sound like Gregory Peck . 
Mann informed me with unshakeable confidence that there would not be a single Hitchens supporter in the audience . ' 
I support Hitchens , ' said David Katz , a rather lugubrious-looking character standing directly behind Mann . 
Suddenly a street-corner argument was served up like an undercard bout before the main event . 
Mann presented his thesis that America had killed more people than any other nation and that the Soviet Union liberated Europe . 
` Yeah , tell that to the Poles , and the Czechs and the Romanians , ' said Katz , as he defended America 's global record on fighting for freedom . 
Katz 's speech did not go down well with the crowd and one woman , who told me that she was a ` progressive egalitarian humanist ' , became so exasperated that she stormed off . 
` It 's OK , ' explained Katz , ` that 's my wife . ' 
Further along , dressed in black and hobbling on crutches , was a man named Roy Rollin who said that he was a ` far-left Trotskyite ' backing Galloway . 
He looked like Richard III and spoke like Rick from The Young Ones . 
` Hitchens has sold his soul to the imperial bourgeoisie to ingratiate himself into the ruling class of America , ' he said . 
These days you would have to rent out an early Woody Allen comedy if you wanted to hear an American employ this kind of language , but Rollin was not joking . 
Nor was anyone else . 
The sense that the proceedings were something of a throwback to a more revolutionary era became impossible to ignore when Hitchens turned up and began distributing leaflets to the crowd . 
They listed Galloway 's various statements and political positions down the years , most of which were news to those gathered . 
To them Galloway was a plain-speaking Scot who had socked it to a Senate committee back in May . 
Some were surprised to read that he had saluted Saddam Hussein and praised other Middle East dictators like Syria 's Bashar al-Assad . 
Nevertheless , Hitchens was met with a volley of abuse , much of it from Rollin , though nothing like what was to come . 
Teetering on the elegant side of dishevelled , Hitchens cut a defiant figure shuffling along the line . 
` Have you got the sheet on fascism ? ' 
he asked , as he proffered another leaflet . 
A veteran of these kinds of meetings , he seemed to relish the contest . 
In years gone by when he was a columnist with the Nation -LRB- the voice of the American dissenting left -RRB- , he was feted by the very people who were now calling him ` disgusting ' , ` an opportunistic whore ' , and other less complimentary terms . 
Nowadays he is denounced by metropolitan radicals as a turncoat . 
First for backing the invasion of Afghanistan , following the 9\/11 attacks , and then , more controversially , for endorsing the invasion of Iraq and the toppling of Saddam Hussein in 2003 . 
Yet buried beneath the accusations and counter accusations , the sense of fringe politics betrayal and disloyalty , this dispute in a college hall also pointed to the heart of much larger issues such as anti-imperialism and principled intervention , totalitarianism and democracy , jihadi terrorism and American militarism . 
Thus it was a kind of theatrical representation of the disagreements that are currently reshaping , splitting and even destroying what was once known as the Left . 
To get a clearer picture of this fracture , I wanted to speak to Hitchens and Galloway before their clash . 
I wanted to visit their respective training camps and discuss at length their opposing outlooks away from the heated atmosphere of the ring - excuse me , stage . 
First I planned to travel to Portugal to see Galloway in his infamous holiday home . 
Then I would go to Washington , where Hitchens now makes a comfortable living as one of the most prolific and gifted political writers in the business . 
Everything seemed set until I made a cardinal error . 
Just a week before the interview with Galloway , I wrote a column that questioned his views on the relationship between free speech and religion . 
At the Edinburgh festival , he had warned in a discussion on a television adaptation of The Satanic Verses that anyone who offended religious beliefs should be aware that they would suffer ` blowback ' . 
` You should do it very carefully , ' he cautioned . 
As the comment was addressed to a panel that included Salman Rushdie , who knew all about ` blowback ' , it might have been construed as indelicate or even threatening . 
I wondered in print how Galloway could appear to be so sensitive to the issue of faith while at the same time lamenting the collapse of the Soviet Union -LRB- what he called the ` biggest catastrophe of my life ' -RRB- , an atheist state in which many people had been imprisoned for 25 years in slave labor camps for the crime of praying . 
But it seems that Galloway , the tough former boxer from Dundee , can take most things in his stride , except criticism . 
The interview was off . ' 
I do n't want to talk to you , ' he told me on the phone , ` and that 's it . ' 
This was a shame . 
I was looking forward to Portugal , and had already mentally packed my swimming trunks . 
With the possible exception of Robert Kilroy-Silk , a man with whom he has a number of uncanny similarities , Galloway is the most deeply tanned politician ever to step foot in Parliament . 
My guess was that we would have had our chat poolside . 
It might not have ranked alongside Galloway 's midnights swims with Fidel Castro in Cuba , but it would have been a welcome break from what we workers refer to as the struggle . 
There were also some questions I wanted to put to him . 
For instance , if he is so firmly committed to anti-imperialism that in any battle between North Korea , Kim Jong-Il 's slave state , and the United States he has said that he would side with North Korea , why did he appear to support the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , a war that is estimated to have killed as many as 1.5 million people and also inspired a generation of jihadis ? 
How could Galloway denounce Arab dictatorships yet toady up to Saddam in 1994 , when he was well aware of his endless crimes . ' 
I thought the President would appreciate to know , ' he told the dictator to his face , ` that even today , three years after the war , I still meet families who are calling their new-born sons Saddam . 
I salute your courage , your strength , your indefatigability . ' 
How could he go to Syria and announce that the country was ` lucky to have Bashar al-Assad as her president ' when its people had no say in the matter . 
And was there any level of terrorist barbarity in Iraq and elsewhere that he would condemn , or was everything acceptable in the war against Western capitalism and democracy ? 
The answers would have to wait . 
Still , I hoped to talk to him in New York before or after the debate . 
In the meantime I flew to Washington DC to put another set of questions to Hitchens . 
Given that neither Hitchens nor Galloway are men who recoil from the sound of their own voice , and both have a persuasive talent with words , it would be a challenge to invent two more contrasting personalities . 
Hitchens is a former public schoolboy who went to Oxford , while Galloway attended grammar school in Dundee and graduated with honors from the uncompromising study that is the Scottish Labor Party . 
Both were drawn to the far left , Hitchens to the Trotskyist International Socialists , which he soon quit , and Galloway to what was effectively the Stalinist wing of the Labor movement . 
He is careful not to praise Stalin the man but rather his achievements in ` industrialising ' the Soviet Union - a process that led , of course , to millions of deaths . 
But perhaps their most commented-upon difference is that Galloway is a teetotaller , while Hitchens , to put it at its mildest , is not . 
I met up with Hitchens at a Georgetown restaurant after a White House party thrown for President Talabani of Iraq . 
He was with a number of Washington wonks and Kurdish supporters , and also Ann Clwyd , Tony Blair 's special envoy on human rights to Iraq . 
Clwyd had known Talabani since his days as a Kurdish resistance leader fighting Saddam . 
She could recall visiting him in the mountains when the idea that he would become president seemed so fanciful as to be absurd . 
What she could not recall was the anti-Saddam activism that Galloway insists he once took part in . 
The Respect MP claims that he was a staunch opponent of Saddam , only supporting his cause after Iraq invaded Kuwait and thereby made an enemy of the US . 
In that first Gulf War , Hitchens , too , took Iraq 's side against the US-led coalition . 
` At the time I would freely admit I really hated Bush senior , ' he told me . 
` But I quite soon began to feel like a dog being washed . 
I did know about the nature of the Saddam regime because I 'd already been in Iraq . 
I had no excuse not to know . 
I suppose I have to plead guilty to thinking of Kuwait as a royal family rather than a nation , but I knew better . 
I was fatally irresolute about this . ' 
It was a visit to Kurdistan , where he saw that Bush Snr was viewed as a hero , that changed his mind . 
For a long time he had thought that unless the Americans created a Palestinian homeland they had no business in the Middle East . ' 
I still do believe in the establishment of a Palestinian homeland but I no longer think that everything else has to be postponed . ' 
It 's this kind of analysis that has led many of his former allies to dismiss him as a neo-conservative . 
` No , ' he states , ` I 'm not any kind of conservative . ' 
All the same , he admires the neo-cons ' willingness to confront the status quo . 
` One heard people who claimed to have radical credentials say that the removal of Saddam would destabilise the Middle East . 
Well excuse me comrades , you like it the way it is ? 
Destabilisation is now a bad word ? ' 
Of course , many people surveying the instability of Iraq today do indeed question the wisdom of the intervention . 
In a perceptive essay he wrote on Churchill , Hitchens suggested a few years ago that the British wartime leader was too committed to war ` to turn back without risking ridicule or obloquy ' . 
I asked him if he ever felt aware of the same risk . 
` There is no analogy to the Churchill position , ' he replies . 
` What would it take for me to desert -LRB- the Iraqi secular and democratic forces -RRB- ? 
Well nothing , there is no way . 
It 's like saying , `` Oh I could n't very well be your friend after you 'd gone broke and been mugged , and after that burglary at your home . '' ' 
Nor is he any more tolerant of the argument that Iraq is another Vietnam . 
` There were no fascists against the Vietnam war but every fascist group is against the war in Iraq . 
I was not against the Vietnam war ; I was pro-the Vietnamese revolution . 
And I would be the same today . 
Galloway is not anti-war . 
He 's pro-war on the other side . 
He 's gone to all the trouble to make that clear and in a way I admire that . 
I think he is hypocritical insofar as he does n't always say the things in London that he says in the Middle East . ' 
Hitchens says that he no longer has any political allegiances , and something he mentioned just before we parted - after a 4am finish at his downtown apartment - seemed to point to where the chasm had opened up between himself and his opponents . 
` It 's not really an argument about the facts of the matter . 
It 's an argument about the mentality . ' 
Whatever patience or sympathy he once had with the outlook that sees the West only as the problem and never the solution had been exhausted . 
His side and Galloway 's side were separated by fundamentally opposing perceptions of reality that could not be bridged by means of reason . 
It did not bode well for the debate . 
In New York I introduced myself to Galloway before the hostilities were under way . 
He smiled and said hello then turned and walked away . 
I was beginning to accept that he was not going to talk to me . 
The event had been arranged as part of his American book tour , promoting Mr Galloway Goes to Washington . 
Tomorrow in Chicago he is speaking with Jane Fonda , a partnership that was organised , much to Hitchens 's amusement , by Eve Ensler , author of The Vagina Monologues At last Hitchens and Galloway took their positions at podiums on either side of the stage , neither looking at the other . 
Among the audience was Oona King , the former Labor MP defeated by Galloway in Bethnal Green . 
In his beard and open-necked casual blue shirt , the Englishman resembled the part-time college lecturer that he in fact is . 
Galloway , by fastidious contrast , was wearing a beige suit with a carefully co-ordinated tie , his bronze pate shining under the stage lights . 
Hitchens began his proposal - ` the war in Iraq is just and necessary ' - by calling for a minute 's silence for the 160 Iraqis murdered that morning in Baghdad by al-Qaeda . 
There were instant boos and hails of protest from some members of the audience . 
In July in Syria Galloway had given a speech celebrating the ' 145 military operations every day ' made by ` these poor Iraqis - ragged people with their sandals and their Kalashnikovs ... ' But the Iraqis killed on Wednesday were poor labourers looking for work and they were blown apart by sophisticated explosives . 
It was not clear to me at least why they were unworthy of a minute 's silence . 
In many ways , the level of debate never recovered from this indecency . 
Both speakers accused one another of sinking to the gutter and both made direct attacks on the other , though it was Galloway who was perhaps the more personal . 
Seeking to trump the ` drink-sodden former Trotskyist popinjay ' remark with which he had bested Hitchens outside the Senate committee meeting back in May , he reflected on his earlier admiration for the writer . 
He had gone on to make natural history , said Galloway , ` by metamorphosing from a butterfly into a slug ' . 
After that he then accused Hitchens of being ` ready to fight to the last drop of other people 's blood ' . 
These were prepared insults that may have pleased a section of the crowd but said nothing about the situation in Iraq today , much less the situation under Saddam . 
But the cheers that they elicited appeared to lift Galloway , or at least the volume of his voice , till he reached a pitch of finger-waving declamation that was both comical and a little frightening to behold . 
Even the moderator , the less than neutral anti-war broadcaster , Amy Goodman , was moved to ask Galloway to place the microphone further away from his mouth . 
But it was to no avail . 
` You did write like an angel , ' Galloway screamed at Hitchens , ` and now you are working for the devil . 
Damn you and damn all your words . ' 
At one of the more surreal moments in the evening , Galloway , his tan reddening as the veins in his neck did battle with his tie , accused Hitchens of ` cheap demagoguery ' . 
The ` popinjay ' may have his faults , but demagoguery is not his style . 
Instead he prefers a more urbane approach of teasing out ironies and inconsistencies . 
How , he wondered , after Galloway had invoked Cindy Sheehan , the antiwar protesting mother of a slain soldier , could he go to Syria and praise the murderers of the son then come here and offer support for the mother . 
Yet Hitchens allowed much of the goodwill he built up to dissipate when he refused to blame George Bush for the debacle in New Orleans , and resisted the idea that racism played a part in the plight of the abandoned citizens of the Gulf coast . 
It seemed almost as if he had it with the bien pensants of the left and wanted to get at them any way that he could . 
As the debate drew to a close , both speakers were eager to finish . 
Like two fighters who had no more punches to throw , they were waiting for the bell . 
Opinion was divided over who triumphed , though from where I sat Hitchens won on points . 
America may see itself as the home of democracy , but there was no vote . 
So it was left to the market to decide . 
A post-event book signing was convened and it was noticeable that the queue was almost twice as long to see Hitchens . 
In the end the evening served to confirm much of what we already knew : Galloway will ally himself with anyone , no matter what their politics , against what he calls the ` two biggest rogue states in the world ' , America and Britain . 
And Hitchens has developed a steely contempt for the defeatism of his former friends . 
` This is masochism , ' he told the audience , ` but it 's being offered to you by a sadist . ' 
Afterwards Amy Goodman told me that in the US it was hard ` to get a debate in which two people disagreed with each other ' . 
I 'm not sure that that 's true , though it might be that to get two people who disagree with each other as much as Hitchens and Galloway you have to look to Britain , which has a more rumbustious tradition in these matters . 
In any case , the two sides of what was once the left - the interventionists and the anti-imperialists - have seldom seemed so far apart , nor Iraq so far away .

2005-09-19,"When Doonesbury was dropped from G2 , hundreds of enraged fans were quick to point out our mistake . 
To celebrate its return , lifelong fan Linda Grant explains what the fuss is about , and talks to its creator Garry Trudeau ` It would be a disservice to Mr Mitchell and his character to prejudge the man , but everything known to date could lead one to conclude he 's guilty . 
Guilty , guilty , guilty !! '' If , whenever you sniff out a lying politician or crook with a good lawyer , you want to look him in the eye and shout : `` Guilty , guilty , guilty ! '' 
, you are , whether you know it or not , uttering the words of that great student revolutionary and radical radio jock Mark Slackmeyer , speaking in this instance of the Watergate conspirator John Mitchell , in 1973 . 
And guilty , guilty , guilty is the indictment of the dolt who thought that it would n't matter if the Guardian , after 25 years of Doonesbury , the comic strip in which Slackmeyer appeared , decided to drop it . 
Why does Doonesbury matter ? 
OK , here 's why . 
It 's all one big 35-year story , starting with the cartoon 's inception in 1970 , with the lives of the eponymous Mike Doonesbury , Mark Slackmeyer and Zonker Harris , from their layabout days on Walden Pond , the student commune in New England , to the baby-boomer middle age we are all stunned to have found ourselves reaching . 
I first came across the strip when I was hitchhiking across the US a year after the Nixon resignation , a 2lb copy of Pynchon 's Gravity 's Rainbow weighing down my backpack . 
I was in America because , well , wow ! 
No one I knew back then was anti-American ; out of the response to the Vietnam war had come the counter-culture . 
America was the country of Gloria Steinem and Ms Magazine , of the Black Panthers and the Chicago Seven , Jane Fonda astride a tank in Hanoi , Vermont communes , hash brownies -LRB- whatever brownies were -RRB- , group marriage , Cheech and Chong . 
You could not turn your back on America if you were at all interested in your own generation and its future . 
I crossed the border into Canada to look up an old boyfriend , a graduate student at the University of Manitoba . 
`` Here , look at this , '' he said , showing me the local newspaper . 
It was a comic strip which did n't just satirise but editorialised , sustaining a day-by-day argument against the government and its domestic and foreign policy , told in narrative form . 
But what jumped out at you about Doonesbury was that it was a comic strip about us . 
We were those student layabouts , and there in the little boxes were our political discussions , our lives , our values . 
The character who most engaged my attention then was Joanie Caucus , the escapee wife and new feminist who tried to bring women 's liberation to the stoned guys in the Walden Pond commune . 
Joanie was a cartoon character with baggage : an ex-husband who would rather go bowling than talk to her , a daughter she was trying to bring up as a free woman . 
And she embodied feminism 's dichotomy ; the desire for freedom and the desire for a relationship . 
We followed the Walden Ponders trying to fix her up with the Rev , the self-styled `` fighting priest who can really talk to the young '' , who had n't had a date since before the Selma march -LRB- `` I 've been busy '' -RRB- , then with Andy Lippincott , perhaps the first ever cartoon character to come out of the closet , mid-frame . 
But the strip 's ambitions ranged beyond the living room at Walden Pond . 
Joanie went to law school at Berkeley . 
She got a job working for a woman senator and married Rick Redfern , the investigative reporter . 
Joanie took us to Washington and the strip took us to Vietnam itself , to meet Phred the Vietcong fighter , later bringing him back to America to testify at a Senate sub-committee on the fate of Cambodian refugees , feted at the kind of radical-chic dinners that Tom Wolfe might have satirised -LRB- `` Can I have your roll ? '' -RRB- . 
The 70s turned into the 80s , into Reagan 's America , and still no one at Walden had graduated . 
We knew Doonesbury was stuck in a timewarp , but it was still a shock when Trudeau took a year off to re-think his characters ' lives . 
His brilliance was to decide to confront us with the choices we were making in our own lives , to turn a political satire into a social one , a critique of what the baby-boom generation was making of its own adulthood . 
Joanie 's boss got Alzheimer 's . 
Mark was the second character to come out as gay and confounded us with sex 's reckless , ruthless political incorrectness , falling in love with a Republican . 
Meanwhile , Mike went to work in advertising and had to represent the tobacco industry : enter a new character , Buttsy , a talking cigarette . 
Mike moved out to Seattle at the time of the dotcom boom to launch the software for a search engine and got eaten alive by Microsoft . 
His wife JJ , Joanie 's daughter , ran off to find herself as a performance artist . 
When the strip returned to Vietnam , Phred was running a resort hotel and acting as a consultant for Nike . 
We went on reading Doonesbury , not just because of the politics , which were as sharp as ever with Reagan in the Oval Office , but because it was the lifelong soap opera of ourselves . 
You could dismiss it as the Archers for ageing hippies , but Trudeau is smart enough to continually update not only the politics , but the characters , introducing the next generation : Joanie and Rick 's son , Alex , now at Walden College , has shamed his parents by joining the CIA as a summer intern , and managing to accidentally launch a Hellfire missile from a Predator drone , taking out an al-Qaida ammo dump . 
Mike 's second wife , Kim Rosenthal , the orphaned Vietnamese-Jewish-Southern-Californian American , entered the strip as a Generation X hacker . 
Trudeau seems to understand contemporary America from top to bottom , from President King , the administrative head of Walden College who is engaged in a losing fight against grade inflation , down to Elmont , a mover and shaker in the Washington , DC homeless community who blew a fortune in day trading . 
And if the strip is always making us laugh and making us angry , it also has the power to move us on many levels . 
The sun coming out over the White House as the Vietnam war ends . 
Andy Lippincott dying of Aids , passing over into death listening to the Beach Boys ' Pet Sounds . 
And this year , the shock of perennial football player and resident Republican BD going to Iraq with his National Guard unit and losing his leg . 
A comic strip that deals with denial , depression , post-operative therapy ? 
But that 's Doonesbury - it just keeps on taking risks with the format . 
There were times , of course , when for a British audience it became incomprehensible as it tackled domestic questions . 
I would ring an American friend to get a briefing on the US constitution , or just stop reading for a week or so , checking in each day to see if he had moved on to something I could once again understand . 
But the strip , which had started out of my fascination with America , has remained the place where you can still understand what America is up to , an invaluable adjunct to its over-reverent journalism . 
As an American friend and long-term reader of the strip told me , and perhaps he was only half-joking : `` The only coverage I read of the Iraq war was in Doonesbury . '' 
Since 1970 , Garry Trudeau has rarely given interviews to the press . 
On Thursday night , Trudeau and I had an email exchange . 
For me , the most fascinating aspect of the cartoon was its narrative character , as if it were a serialised 19th-century novel . 
So when Trudeau took that year off , to reinvent his characters , had he had a long-term plan for each of them ? 
`` No , it was more a matter of setting them on individual paths out into the real world , '' he replied . 
`` When the strip returned , all the characters had moved forward in real time - back stories included graduation , a wedding , new jobs etc - but there was no plan beyond the new setups . 
I 've always thought of the strip as more journal than novel . 
It 's true that comics often use novelistic conventions - such as routinely tossing the characters into a great thicket of Dickensian coincidence - but mostly Doonesbury is put together on the fly , as running dispatches , so fleetingly observed that I ca n't even remember writing whole sequences . '' 
Was he pissed off at the Guardian 's decision to erase him ? 
`` Are you allowed to say ` piss off ' in British newspapers ? 
Writing for the Guardian must be fun . 
I 've certainly enjoyed appearing there . 
If memory serves , the paper signed up for Doonesbury nearly 25 years ago , just before I took a long sabbatical from the strip . 
We withdrew the feature from all 600 or so client papers , save one - the Guardian . 
We had been so delighted by the placement - and were so concerned that , once left in the lurch , the paper would never come back - that we decided to provide the Guardian with repeat episodes -LRB- it helped that we had 10 years ' worth of strips in the archives that the British public had n't seen -RRB- . 
As to the recent cancellation , I knew nothing of the decision prior to the strip being reinstated , so there was no opportunity to work myself up into a righteous snit , which was a disappointment . '' 
Doonesbury must seem to many Americans the only place in the country where dissent is still possible , and where its presidents are routinely exposed and satirised in a way that its supine press has failed to emulate . 
I asked him if he felt that his comic strip was doing a better job than the newspapers they are printed in , in sustaining a climate of political dissent in contemporary America ? 
`` Well , that 's not really for me to judge , '' he replied . 
`` I will say there 's no shortage of dissent in America - it 's just that it 's largely impotent . 
Challenges to the White House narrative continue to be reframed as unpatriotic . 
And fear-mongering has disabled civil public discourse . 
Before the last election , our friends abroad could say the problem was Bush , not the American people . 
Perhaps Doonesbury flatters us . 
It reminds us of who we once were , of our values . 
I prefer to think that it keeps us honest , because those values do not seem to have abandoned Trudeau himself . 
The counter-culture sold out , its idealism failed , we had to compromise : with being adults , holding down jobs , being parents . 
Would he go on drawing it to his dying day , or might there be a final strip , a final frame , The End ? 
`` As to when it all ends , '' he said , `` there are so many unforeseeable factors ; health , energy , interest - it 's impossible to know . '' 
But when the last Doonesbury cartoon appears , it will be the one of the great social and political records of the 20th and 21st centuries . 
A daily dose of satire and humanity , stretched across a whole lifetime Cartoons GB Trudeau .

She is very in touch with her emotional side , having served on the California State Task Force to Promote Self-esteem . 
Zonker Harris , Californian hippy-turnednanny , who acted as spin doctor on Duke 's unsuccessful 2000 presidential bid but is now surfing again - although he gave up his suntan after a brush with skin cancer . 
He used part of a $ 23m lottery win to buy a British title but has mislaid the rest of the money . 
Is now in charge of BD and Boopsie 's daughter , Samantha . 
Also serving in Iraq , until one of his legs was shot off , has been BD -LRB- Brian Dowling -RRB- , the all-round American hero and male chauvinist who has served in every major war from Vietnam to Iraq . 
Losing his leg led to BD being seen without his helmet for the first time , an event so momentous it was reported around the world . 
BD is back at home with his wife Boopsie . 
Uncle Duke is a mainstay , based on Hunter S Thompson and once described as `` Forrest Gump 's evil twin '' . 
His gonzo career has taken him from China -LRB- as ambassador -RRB- to American Samoa -LRB- he was governor -RRB- and the 2000 presidential election -LRB- he ran -RRB- . 
Recently he has been in Iraq , where he became mayor of Al Amok , a town he made sure lived up to its name . 
After a painful divorce and a succession of illadvised liaisons , ex-women 's libber Joanie found love with reporter Rick Redfern , became a district attorney and moaned about her work-life balance . 
Now an empty nester , she fears she will never have the financial wherewithal to retire .

2005-09-20,"Tony Blair : a modern-day bogeyman ? 
Photo : Martin Argles The tail-slicing farmer 's wife and Muffet-scaring spider have been joined in the panoply of brutal nursery rhyme figures by a new bogeyman - Tony Blair . 
The prime minister is the star - or more accurately villain - of the winning entry of a competition to create new nursery rhymes for the millennium . 
The rhyme , which could make less politically-minded parents long for the simple innocence of Mary and her little lamb , is an earnest ditty intended to educate youngsters on the government 's decision to take Britain to war in Iraq . 
`` Baker Tony 's Pizza , '' victorious in the nationwide Time for a New Rhyme contest run by the children 's digital television channel Nick Jr , portrays Mr Blair as a baker creating deceptively-attractive pizzas of dye and sawdust that `` made all the children cry '' . 
The judges of the competition , who included the poet Michael Rosen and the television presenter Lorraine Kelly , thought that the rhyme 's `` political undertones '' reflected the contemporary social criticism of many much older verses familiar from the cradle or the playground . 
Its author , Angela Martin , 57 , said her inspiration had come from a `` desire to educate our children on the politics of the Iraq war in a light-hearted fashion '' . 
Whether or not the rhyme is adopted by parents crooning their babies to sleep or by skipping-rope jumpers in the playground remains to be seen . 
However , alternative themes behind other entries to the competition were no less serious : topics included the Pope 's death , the pressures of working parents , Jamie Oliver 's school dinners campaign -LRB- the subject of 16 % of entries -RRB- , the September 11 terrorist attacks and the Boxing Day tsunami . 
The second runner-up , by Jayne Fletcher Tomlinson , 48 , is an unchallenging verse titled Bus , Train , Bike and Car which only highlights the powerful plague-inspired grittiness of Ring a Ring o'Roses . 
The competition 's organisers hope the winners will follow in a powerful tradition of nursery rhymes , which have long supplied a sometimes coded oral history of key royal and political events .

2005-09-23,"Studies will help scientists tease out problem genes Critics say boundaries being pushed too far Scientists have successfully transplanted human chromosomes into mice , a first that promises to transform medical research into the genetic causes of disease . 
The mice were genetically engineered to carry a copy of human chromosome 21 , a string of about 250 genes . 
About one in a thousand people are born with an extra copy of the chromosome , a genetic hiccup that causes Down 's syndrome . 
Genetic studies of the mice will help scientists to nail down which genes give rise to medical conditions which are prevalent among people with Down 's syndrome , such as impaired brain development , heart defects , behavioural abnormalities , Alzheimer 's disease and leukemia . 
Medical researchers yesterday hailed the work as a `` tour de force '' , but critics accused the team of pushing the boundaries of genetic manipulation too far and blurring the distinction of what was biologically human . 
Elizabeth Fisher at the Institute of Neurology and Victor Tybulewicz at the National Institute for Medical Research in London spent 13 years perfecting the technique which is reported in the journal Science today . 
To create the mice , the team first extracted chromosomes from human cells and squirted them on to beds of stem cells taken from mouse embryos . 
Any stem cells that absorbed human chromosome 21 were injected into three-day-old mouse embryos which were then re-implanted into their mothers . 
The newly born mice carried copies of the chromosome and were able to pass it on to their own young . 
`` By adding the chromosome , we have mice that show nearly all of the characteristics of Down 's syndrome in humans , '' said Dr Fisher . 
`` It means we can tease out the genes that give rise to the different aspects of Down 's syndrome , because we know we 've got the right genes in there . '' 
According to Dr Tybulewicz , genetic tests on the mice , which will systematically knock out different genes on the transplanted chromosome , will help identify which gene or genes cause each of the symptoms common to people with Down 's syndrome . 
`` This should illuminate which genes lead to heart defects , the higher risk of leukemia and early onset Alzheimer 's , '' he said . 
Peter Scambler , a molecular geneticist at the Institute of Child Health in London , said : `` This is a technical tour de force . 
It 's difficult to envisage how one could otherwise tackle something as complex as Down 's syndrome , because we ca n't go around creating human embryos with the condition . '' 
Steve Brown , director of the Medical Research Council 's mammalian genetics unit , said : `` This will tell us a lot about which genes are key to the myriad abnormalities we associate most with Down 's syndrome . 
We are taking a step forward in the tools we have to investigate the genetic basis of these conditions . '' 
But according to David King , of the pressure group Human Genetics Alert , the potential breakthrough comes at too high a cost . 
`` Creating organisms with whole chromosomes from another species is genetic engineering taken to another level . 
`` Before , researchers have said they 're not making big changes because they 're only inserting the odd gene into animals . 
If you 're talking about creating something with a whole human chromosome in it , you have to ask is this really a mouse any more ? 
Is it starting to be a new species , a hybrid between a mouse and a human ? 
If more chromosomes are put in , are we going to have to start giving these things pseudo human rights ? '' 
Dr King said the research could lead to technologies that would allow humans to be genetically engineered . 
`` Once Britain has a clear ban on human genetic engineering , I 'll be much happier for scientists to do these studies with mice . 
But they 're developing techniques that could be applied to human beings and , in essence , that leads to a new form of eugenics , '' he said . 
Dr Fisher said the transferring of a chromosome was merely a more effective way of swapping large numbers of genes into an animal to benefit medical testing . 
`` We 're not trying to humanise mice , we 're trying to tease out the genetics of a very complex disorder . '' 
Dr Tybulewicz added : `` There 's nothing more obviously humanlike about these mice than any others . 
If you were to see them , you 'd not be able to tell they are different to a normal one . '' 
Carol Boys of the Down 's Syndrome Association said she welcomed the research if it would lead to an improvement in the lives of people with Down 's syndrome . 
`` Any research that could lead to a greater understanding of why people with Down 's syndrome are more susceptible to certain medical conditions is important . 
However , this research does not herald a ` cure ' or a ` treatment ' for Down 's syndrome . '' 
Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes , each a continuous strand of tightly coiled DNA , which together contain our entire complement of genes . 
The two sexes share 22 of the pairs , but the 23rd pair , the sex chromosomes , differ , with women having two X chromosomes and men having one X and one Y chromosome . 
People born with three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the usual two develop Down 's syndrome . 
About 60,000 people have it in the UK . 
People with Down 's syndrome typically have craniofacial abnormalities , impaired brain development and are at a greater risk of leukemia , heart defects and Alzheimer 's disease . 
They can expect to live to between 40 and 60 . 
In the first few days of their existence , embryos contain stem cells that can form any of the tissues needed to make an entire organism , including bone , skin , muscle or nervous tissue . 
One of the most common ways to find out what a gene does in an animal is to knock it out . 
When scientists knock out a gene they silence it , so that it is in effect missing from the animal . 
Comparing animals with and without the gene helps reveal the role of the gene . 
The science of using controlled breeding to increase the occurrence of desirable heritable characteristics in a population .

2005-09-23,"Play for today : Hair at the Gate Theatre . 
Photograph : Tristram Kenton Hair was the incarnation of the 60s `` American Tribal Love Rock Musical '' that joyously celebrated a way of life and that in 1968 famously became the first show to benefit from the demise of theatrical censorship . 
But , delightful though it is to see it revived , I 'm not sure it gains from Daniel Kramer 's determined attempt to update it . 
The book and lyrics by Gerome Ragni and James Rado are still there : it remains the tenuous story of Claude , a New York tribal leader , separated from his gang when he goes off to a foreign war . 
And the Galt MacDermot tunes remain as fresh as ever . 
Merely to hear once again Aquarius , Good Morning Starshine , Manchester England and all the rest is to be transported back to a time of hippie optimism when the Sunday joint was to be smoked rather than eaten . 
But , in Kramer 's version , the action all takes place today . 
Instead of being drafted to Vietnam , Claude now goes to Iraq . 
Bush , Rummy and Condie became the symbols of American patriotism . 
When the tribe wants to protest about militarism it holds a candlelit vigil for peace in the Middle East . 
The problem with this is twofold . 
Claude 's heroes remain Timothy Leary and film directors such as Fellini and Antonioni which sounds anachronistic in a modern context . 
More seriously , the show is a celebration of a collective ethic : a belief that the group is stronger than the individual . 
It reeks of the 60s rather than now when the culture induces a hermetic individualism . 
Hair is as much a period-piece as No No Nanette and should be presented as such : as an evocation of a moment when sexual liberation was new , and a young generation was rejecting inherited values . 
But Kramer 's production and Ann Yee 's choreography have bags of oomph and fill the Gate stage to overflowing . 
The actors are also good . 
Charles Aitken plays Claude like a stoned angel . 
Kevin Wathen lends his chum , Berger , a feverish promiscuity . 
Nancy Wei-George sings one of the best and most touching songs , Frank Mills , with heart-rending simplicity . 
I had a good time ; and anyone who has never encountered Hairbefore will succumb even more readily to its charms . 
But I could n't help thinking back to seeing Hair in LA in 1969 when Ragni and Rado were themselves in the cast . 
It seemed then the perfect expression of the genius loci and of the mood of young America at that moment . 
I would n't deny that protest in the face of the Iraq war is still alive . 
But Hair belongs in its moment and , for all Kramer 's skill , I wish he 'd preserved its period flavor .

2005-09-24,"Saturday 24 September 2005 15.16 BST Anti-war demonstrators gathered today for a march in central London on the eve of the Labor Party conference to demand that the government withdraw all British troops in Iraq . 
Scotland Yard estimated that as many as 10,000 people had joined by the time the protest had reached Hyde Park at 2.10 pm , although organisers put numbers at anything up to 100,000 . 
Earlier , hundreds of protesters converged on College Green outside the House of Lords amid heavy police security . 
Crash barriers lined the streets and surrounded Parliament Square where last year 's protest against the foxhunting bill had descended into violence . 
More campaigners continued to arrive as the protest prepared to start on its route through Whitehall and on to Hyde Park . 
People holding banners inscribed with slogans including `` Bush world no 1 terrorist '' , `` No war , no nukes '' and `` Blair 's taking liberties , troops home now '' swarmed on every piece of grass available . 
At 1.20 pm a group of protesters holding hands around a banner demanding : `` Troops home from Iraq , '' led the march past the war memorial and on to Trafalgar Square . 
At least 50 policemen and three police vans watched as they marched past the entrance to Downing Street . 
Some campaigners shouted towards No 10 : `` Down with Downing Street , '' and `` Stop the bombings . '' 
British soldier Lance-Corporal George Solomou , who refused his call-up to serve in Iraq , was also at the front of the march . 
He said : `` I am here to show my solidarity . 
The British people are increasingly realizing that they have been told more and more lies about the war . '' 
Janet Brown , a retired teacher from Manchester , said : `` The war is corrupt and it stinks . 
It has been a total lie from the beginning , we are constantly being lied to and Bush and Blair have to be answerable . 
`` They are just making a bad situation worse and there is no way that it is tolerable . '' 
Keir McKechnie , the secretary of Glasgow 's Stop The War Coalition had traveled down to London overnight . 
He said there were three coaches from Glasgow , another two from Edinburgh and one from Dundee . 
He said : `` We have come down here today because we want Tony Blair to know that the anti-war movement has not been kowtowed by his attempts to curb civil liberties . 
Every single troop has to be brought home safely and not in body bags which is what is happening in Basra . '' 
He added that ` there has been a watershed over the last week because millions of people now know that it really is a nightmare out there and that if Tony Blair continues to ally himself with Bush he is pulling himself further and further into a conflict that is unwinnable . '' 
Sacked Gate Gourmet workers also joined the protest . 
Holding banners declaring : `` Our fight is your fight , '' they repeatedly chanted : `` We want justice : troops out , workers in . '' 
In Washington tens of thousands are expected today for what is being billed as one of the biggest anti-war protests in the US since the Vietnam era . 
The figurehead of the United For Peace and Justice Mobilisation is Cindy Sheehan , the mother of a soldier killed in Iraq who set up camp outside George Bush 's ranch in Crawford , Texas , during his summer holiday .

2005-09-25,"Defense Secretary confident withdrawal will start in May Plan follows pressure for exit strategy British troops will start a major withdrawal from Iraq next May under detailed plans on military disengagement to be published next month , The Observer can reveal . 
The document being drawn up by the British government and the US will be presented to the Iraqi parliament in October and will spark fresh controversy over how long British troops will stay in the country . 
Tony Blair hopes that , despite continuing and widespread violence in Iraq , the move will show that there is progress following the conflict of 2003 . 
Britain has already privately informed Japan - which also has troops in Iraq - of its plans to begin withdrawing from southern Iraq in May , a move that officials in Tokyo say would make it impossible for their own 550 soldiers to remain . 
The increasingly rapid pace of planning for British military disengagement has been revealed on the eve of the Labor Party conference , which will see renewed demands for a deadline for withdrawal . 
It is hoped that a clearer strategy on Iraq will quieten critics who say that the government will not be able to ` move on ' until Blair quits . 
Yesterday , about 10,000 people demonstrated against the army 's continued presence in the country . 
Speaking to The Observer this weekend , the Defense Secretary , John Reid , insisted that the agreement being drawn up with Iraqi officials was contingent on the continuing political process , although he said he was still optimistic British troops would begin returning home by early summer . 
` The two things I want to insist about the timetable is that it is not an event but a process , and that it will be a process that takes place at different speeds in different parts of the country . 
I have said before that I believe that it could begin in some parts of the country as early as next July . 
It is not a deadline , but it is where we might be and I honestly still believe we could have the conditions to begin handover . 
I do n't see any reason to change my view . 
` But if circumstances change I have no shame in revising my estimates . ' 
The disclosures follow rising demands for the government to establish a clearer strategy for bringing troops home following the kidnapping of two British SAS troopers in Basra and the scenes of violence that surrounded their rescue . 
Last week Blair 's own envoy to Iraq , Sir Jeremy Greenstock , warned that Britain could be forced out if Iraq descends so far into chaos that ` we do n't have any reasonable prospect of holding it together ' . 
Continued tension between the Iraqi police force , the Iraqi administration and British troops was revealed again yesterday when an Iraqi magistrate called for the arrest of the two British special forces soldiers . 
who were on a surveillance mission when they were taken into custody by Iraqi police and allegedly handed on to a militia . 
For Blair , the question of withdrawal is one of the most difficult he is facing . 
The Prime Minister has abandoned plans , announced last February , to publish his own exit strategy setting out the milestones which would have to be met before quitting : instead , the plans are now being negotiated between a commission representing the Shia-dominated Iraqi government , and senior US and UK diplomats and military commanders in Baghdad . 
Senior military sources have told The Observer that the document will lay out a point-by-point ` road map ' for military disengagement by multinational forces , the first steps of which could be put in place soon after December 's nationwide elections . 
Each stage of the withdrawal would be locally judged on regional improvements in stability , with units being withdrawn as Iraqi units are deemed capable of taking over . 
Officials familiar with the negotiations said that conditions for withdrawal would not demand a complete cessation of insurgent violence , or the end of al-Qaeda atrocities . 
According to the agreement under negotiation , each phase would be triggered when key security , stability and political targets have been reached . 
The phased withdrawal strategy - the British side of which is expected to take at least 12 months to complete - would see UK troops hand over command responsibility for security to senior Iraqi officers , while remaining in support as a reserve force . 
In the second phase British Warriors and other armored vehicles would be removed from daily patrols , before a complete withdrawal of British forces to barracks . 
The final phase - departure of units - would follow a period of months where Iraqi units had demonstrated their ability to deal with violence in their areas of operation . 
Blair will tackle his critics over Iraq in his conference speech , aides said this weekend , but would decline to give a public deadline for withdrawing troops . 
He is expected to make several major interventions on the war in the coming weeks , before a vote on the new constitution in mid-October , explaining how Iraq could be steered towards a sufficiently stable situation to allow troops to come home . 
` What we are not going to set out is a timetable : what we are going to set out is a process of developing that security capability , ' said a Downing Street source . 
` We do n't want to be there any longer than we have to be , the Iraqis do n't want us to be there any longer than we have to be , but the Iraqi Prime Minister has made it very clear that our presence there is one that is necessary . ' 
It was revealed yesterday that an Iraqi judge issued the warrants for the arrest of the two rescued soldiers , accusing them of killing one policeman and wounding another , carrying unlicensed weapons and holding false identification . 
The continuing preparations for a military withdrawal come , however , as officials are bracing themselves for a new political crisis in Iraq next month , with what many regard as the inevitable rejection of a new constitution by a two-thirds majority in three provinces , sufficient to kill the document and trigger new elections . 
The same officials believe that a failure of the controversial constitution - which Sunnis say favors the Shia majority - would require at least another year of political negotiations , threatening any plans to disengage .

2005-09-25,"It may be the oddest tale to emerge from the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . 
Armed dolphins , trained by the US military to shoot terrorists and pinpoint spies underwater , may be missing in the Gulf of Mexico . 
Experts who have studied the US navy 's cetacean training exercises claim the 36 mammals could be carrying ` toxic dart ' guns . 
Divers and surfers risk attack , they claim , from a species considered to be among the planet 's smartest . 
The US navy admits it has been training dolphins for military purposes , but has refused to confirm that any are missing . 
Dolphins have been trained in attack-and-kill missions since the Cold War . 
The US Atlantic bottlenose dolphins have apparently been taught to shoot terrorists attacking military vessels . 
Their coastal compound was breached during the storm , sweeping them out to sea . 
But those who have studied the controversial use of dolphins in the US defense program claim it is vital they are caught quickly . 
Leo Sheridan , 72 , a respected accident investigator who has worked for government and industry , said he had received intelligence from sources close to the US government 's marine fisheries service confirming dolphins had escaped . 
` My concern is that they have learned to shoot at divers in wetsuits who have simulated terrorists in exercises . 
If divers or windsurfers are mistaken for a spy or suicide bomber and if equipped with special harnesses carrying toxic darts , they could fire , ' he said . 
` The darts are designed to put the target to sleep so they can be interrogated later , but what happens if the victim is not found for hours ? ' 
Usually dolphins were controlled via signals transmitted through a neck harness . 
` The question is , were these dolphins made secure before Katrina struck ? ' 
The mystery surfaced when a separate group of dolphins was washed from a commercial oceanarium on the Mississippi coast during Katrina . 
Eight were found with the navy 's help , but the dolphins were not returned until US navy scientists had examined them . 
Sheridan is convinced the scientists were keen to ensure the dolphins were not the navy 's , understood to be kept in training ponds in a sound in Louisiana , close to Lake Pontchartrain , whose waters devastated New Orleans . 
The navy launched the classified Cetacean Intelligence Mission in San Diego in 1989 , where dolphins , fitted with harnesses and small electrodes planted under their skin , were taught to patrol and protect Trident submarines in harbor and stationary warships at sea . 
Criticism from animal rights groups ensured the use of dolphins became more secretive . 
But the project gained impetus after the Yemen terror attack on the USS Cole in 2000 . 
Dolphins have also been used to detect mines near an Iraqi port . 
"
2005-09-28,"Scott Ritter was the former US marine captain tasked with finding Saddam Hussein 's weapons . 
Now , in this first detailed account , he reveals how the CIA plotted to use a UN weapons inspection to overthrow the Iraqi regime - and how fiasco turned to tragedy when it failed ` This is big , Scott , '' Moshe Ponkovsky said . 
`` We do n't share this with anyone . '' 
Israel 's military intelligence was already assisting us at Unscom -LRB- the United Nations Special Commission , which ran the UN 's weapons inspections program in Iraq -RRB- by scrutinising the `` take '' from the American U-2 spy-plane flights over Iraq . 
It had proved an unorthodox but fruitful relationship for Unscom : the Israeli analysts had proved far superior to the CIA 's . 
But what I was now proposing to the Israelis was a dramatic expansion of this intelligence-sharing . 
I was asking Lieutenant Colonel Ponkovsky and his colleagues to accept tapes from a secret Unscom-British communications eavesdropping operation that we were planning in Baghdad itself . 
The Israelis would process the data -LRB- ie , break any codes or ciphers the Iraqis might be using , and translate -RRB- , and analyze them to determine if there was anything useful for Unscom 's mandate of disarming Iraq . 
It was an ambitious , and possibly dangerous , project , but I had the backing of Unscom 's senior executives - its chairman , the Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekus , his American deputy , state department official Charles Duelfer , and Russian arms control expert Nikita Smidovich . 
By the end of January 1996 , the scheme was falling into place : Ponkovsky told me that his boss , director of military intelligence General Ya'alon , had given authorisation . 
Just one part of the jigsaw puzzle was missing : with Britain providing the intercept team , and Israel doing the analysis , that just left the Americans . 
Earlier that month , Duelfer had handed me a paper from the CIA containing a series of questions about Unscom 's communications intercept plan . 
Until then , the CIA had been disdainful of Unscom as a tool for intelligence-gathering , but now they were getting interested . 
Not that I knew it at the time , but the hidden agenda was regime change . 
Steve Richter , the head of the CIA 's Near East Division , had decided that the CIA would extend a helping hand - as long as they could exploit Unscom 's work to further its plans for a coup against Saddam Hussein . 
This newfound enthusiasm for Unscom was only confirmed when the CIA saw how weapons inspectors were increasingly gaining access to some of the most sensitive sites in Iraq , including bases belonging to the Special Republican Guard - Saddam 's personal bodyguard . 
The CIA coup plan went like this : if Unscom inspections could somehow be used to trigger a crisis , that would create a pretext for a US military attack against the Special Republican Guard , then Saddam 's personal security force could be decapitated . 
This would clear the way for the plotters , led by Mohammad Abdullah al-Shawani , a former commander of Iraqi Special Forces who had defected to Amman in Jordan and been recruited by the CIA , to make their move . 
But I had no idea of the CIA 's ulterior motives for offering assistance when , on February 4 1996 , I greeted the British eavesdropping team as they arrived at Washington 's Dulles Airport to receive training and equipment from the CIA . 
The five intercept operators , led by Gary , a short , fit man in his early 30s , would become known as the `` Special Collection Element '' -LRB- SCE -RRB- . 
The Brits proved to be fast learners , and I was back in northern Virginia by mid-February , checking up on the preparation of the SCE team before escorting them to Bahrain and on to Baghdad . 
The Iraqis , meanwhile , were well aware of the potential intelligence value of the access gained by the weapons inspectors . 
The Iraqi secret service , the Mukhabarat , already maintained a unit dedicated to Unscom . 
The Mukhabarat 's priority was to get sanctions lifted - Iraq 's number one national security priority . 
Its director had been told by Saddam Hussein himself that Iraq had disarmed , and no longer had any interest in developing any WMD capability . 
But sanctions could not be lifted until Unscom inspectors reached that conclusion for themselves . 
So the Mukhabarat 's objective was not to obstruct our work ; quite the reverse , they had an interest in getting the Iraqi experts who were our counterparts to cooperate . 
Their problem was that these officials were petrified of the Special Security Organisation , run by Saddam 's son Qusay Hussein . 
If their cooperation with Unscom was seen as compromising the regime 's security , the consequences for the individuals involved would have been brutal . 
Because they regarded such locations as Special Republican Guard units as off-limits , the Special Security Organisation demanded early warning of any inspection effort targeting presidential security . 
As a consequence , the Mukhabarat redoubled its efforts to penetrate Unscom - with outstanding success . 
First , electronic surveillance of our computers in Baghdad , Bahrain and New York was established . 
Then , with French technical assistance provided via the French economic liaison in Baghdad - whether by rogue element , or with official permission is still unknown - the Mukhabarat broke Unscom 's encryption system , so they could listen in on all `` secure '' phone calls between Baghdad and New York . 
With their advance knowledge of Unscom 's plans , the Iraqis were able to pre-empt inspections at will . 
By June 1996 , a new inspection , Unscom 150 , was getting under way . 
The aim was to shed light on the Iraqi mechanism of concealment - specifically the role of the Special Security Organisation . 
The paramilitary wing of the CIA was taking an extraordinary interest in Unscom 150 . 
A man I knew as Moe Dobbs , a former American weapons inspector who was in fact a senior officer in the CIA 's covert operations Special Activities Staff -LRB- SAS -RRB- , had assigned three men to provide logistics and communications support for the team . 
In retrospect this was suspicious , but at the time I was just grateful to get the help we so badly needed . 
Smidovich and I put together an inspection plan , which had us `` squeezing '' Special Republican Guard facilities in the Baghdad area . 
With Israeli help , I had found the location of every Special Republican Guard unit around the capital . 
Strangely , Dobbs and the SAS objected to one of these targets - a barracks belonging to the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Brigade . 
`` There 's nothing there , '' Dobbs said . 
`` We 've checked it out . '' 
We dropped it from our list . 
While we were busy planning our inspection , the CIA 's Iraq Operations Group had dispatched a special team of agents to its Amman Station to coordinate coup planning with the Iraqi National Accord -LRB- INA -RRB- , a group of Iraqi expatriates led by a former Ba'athist official , Iyad Alawi , whom Richter had brought together with al-Shawani . 
The White House was under political pressure to be seen to be doing something about Iraq . 
When the CIA said they had a plan - the `` Silver Bullet '' coup - to get rid of Saddam Hussein , the White House approved it . 
Of course , there was a political dimension : the upcoming presidential elections in November 1996 . 
Tony Lake , the national security adviser to President Clinton , was sensitive to any possibility of an `` October Surprise '' and , in private discussions with CIA director John Deutch -LRB- denied by both Deutch and Lake , but acknowledged by many CIA insiders -RRB- , ordered that the coup be wrapped up by early summer . 
The only problem was that this coup , supposedly planned in great secrecy , was well known to the Iraqi government . 
Many of the defectors being used by the CIA were actually Mukhabarat double agents . 
Then , through a series of tragic mistakes , the Mukhabarat took control of one of the CIA 's secure satellite communications units used by the INA to communicate with the plotters in Baghdad . 
So the Mukhabarat learned every detail of the plan - including the fact that the CIA was linking the timing of the coup with the Unscom inspection in early June . 
When the Unscom 150 team arrived in Baghdad on June 10 1996 under the watchful , if somewhat hostile , stares of our Iraqi minders , Rolf Ekus and the rest of Unscom were completely unaware of the CIA 's ulterior motive . 
On the very first day , one team was prevented from inspecting a Special Republican Guard barracks in Abu Ghraib . 
The following day , another group set out for the headquarters of 1st Brigade , SRG . 
The Iraqis were having none of that either , and Unscom 150 found itself in a stand-off with automatic-rifle-wielding SRG troopers . 
The Security Council reacted to Baghdad 's non-cooperation by passing a new resolution , 1060 , which `` deplored '' the denial of access and demanded full cooperation . 
Two days later , the inspectors were still parked in the sun . 
The decision to send Ekus to Iraq was , on the surface , curious . 
Clearly , had the US still wanted to bomb Iraq , they would have pushed harder for a finding of `` material breach '' . 
The truth was that this sudden U-turn - renewed American support for diplomacy - was driven by the fact that the CIA coup plot was collapsing around them . 
While Unscom 150 was parked out front of the Special Republican Guard facilities , the CIA station in Amman was desperately trying to contact the ringleaders of the coup in Baghdad . 
But their entire network was silent . 
It was as if they had disappeared off the face of the earth . 
In reality , Saddam 's intelligence service had so thoroughly infiltrated the plot that there was n't a single CIA-controlled asset left in Iraq who had not been arrested by the Mukhabarat . 
For the Iraqi leadership there was a clear case for terminating all contact with Unscom , but the Mukhabarat 's Unscom cell had convinced Tariq Aziz and others , including Saddam , that Unscom was being used and was not a witting player in the coup attempt . 
The Iraqis knew economic sanctions could not be lifted without a favourable report on compliance from Unscom ; Ekus promised to work hard to this end , but needed help . 
On June 22 , Ekus and Tariq Aziz signed what became known as the `` Agreement for the Modalities of Sensitive Site Inspections '' , which governed how Unscom would go about inspecting sites belonging to Republican Guard , Special Republican Guard , Special Security Organisation , Mukhabarat and other security institutions . 
Ekus had done his job - averting a war , while keeping weapons inspections on track . 
The ramifications of the collapsed coup had yet to sink in . 
Any remaining hopes within the CIA were quashed when , on June 26 , the Agency 's Amman station allegedly received a transmission from one of their secure satellite phones . 
On the line was the Mukhabarat , who told astonished CIA agents that the game was up . 
Within days the CIA team in Amman vanished . 
The US had witnessed a covert action fiasco of a kind not seen since the Bay of Pigs in 1961 . 
Saddam 's security services had rounded up more than 800 suspected plotters , most of whom were tortured and executed . 
All traces of the CIA 's involvement in a coup plot against Saddam were eliminated . 
It was the last time I , or anyone in Unscom , saw Moe Dobbs and his colleagues . 
Meanwhile , I was anxious for an opportunity to put the new agreement to the test . 
On June 24 , I got it - in the form of a CIA-provided photograph that showed a gathering of vehicles outside a Special Republican Guard site on the southern tip of Saddam International Airport , which I labeled `` Site 1a '' . 
SCE intercepts of Iraqi minder communications showed that , at the time the U-2 photograph was taken , the Iraqis wanted to know where every inspector was - arousing our suspicion of ongoing concealment activity . 
This made `` 1a '' an ideal candidate for testing the `` sensitive site modalities '' . 
Less than a month later , we formed up outside the Baghdad Monitoring and Verification Centre . 
At the initial Special Republican Guard checkpoint just on the edge of Saddam International Airport , the two convoys - Iraqi and Unscom - linked up and proceeded down the road . 
We passed through the next two Special Republican Guard checkpoints without problems . 
But then , as we closed in on Site 1a , we came to a new checkpoint , and these guards were n't playing around . 
Taking up positions in a horseshoe pattern , they aimed loaded rifles , machine guns and grenade launchers at our convoy . 
Suddenly , a vehicle arrived in front of us , on the other side of the checkpoint . 
Two officers stepped out , took a quick look at the situation , and barked some orders . 
The gate was opened and we moved on . 
To our left was the southern edge of Saddam International Airport , and to our right a lush game park with several different species of gazelle and antelope - Saddam 's personal stock for his kitchen . 
Finally , we reached the compounds of Site 1a . 
As soon as the inspection began , I understood why the Iraqis were so nervous about our presence here . 
The eastern compound was , as we thought , affiliated with the Special Republican Guard . 
But it was n't just any SRG unit - it was Saddam 's personal bodyguard , the Radwaniyah Platoon , 2nd Company of the 1st Battalion . 
This unit was equipped with shiny silver Mercedes sedans , parked in a line under a covered lot . 
Two of the cars had tarpaulins over them , which , when pulled back , showed the effects of an earlier ambush . 
One had been riddled with machine-gun bullets , shattering the bullet-proof windows and penetrating the armored doors . 
The occupants of the second car had gone through an even more terrifying experience : it had obviously been struck by a rocket-propelled grenade . 
Otherwise , it was a standard military barracks , but a search of files turned up something that caught my attention : an emergency administrative notice , declaring that the 3rd Battalion -LRB- Special Forces -RRB- , Special Republican Guard , was `` liquidated '' , and all its members were placed on administrative leave pending further notice . 
The 3rd Battalion had been the unit singled out by Dobbs and the CIA as being off-limits for inspection during Unscom 150 . 
I now realized what this meant : `` Stay away , those are our guys . '' 
Reading of their fate , I felt sick to my stomach . 
On my way home through London , I again took advantage of a layover at Heathrow to pay a visit to the Defense Intelligence Staff , which had provided Gary and his colleagues for Unscom 's Special Collection Element in Baghdad . 
I was unshaven and dressed in jeans , with the desert dust of Iraq still in the crevices of my hiking boots . 
I looked very rough , but this was just a social visit , a chance to get a quick bite to eat with friends . 
Or so I thought . 
The door to the director 's office opened , and the director himself walked out , a tall man with a broad smile and firm handshake . 
`` Please join us , will you ? 
We have something we want you to read and comment on . '' 
Inside the folder I was handed was a lengthy report , classified top secret , and containing several US codewords I was familiar with . 
The subject line read : `` UN COMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPT OPERATION UP AND RUNNING IN BAGHDAD . '' 
I glanced down at the list of addressees . 
This document had been sent around the world , to every embassy and military headquarters the US maintained . 
This was more than just giving people a heads-up about our SCE operation . 
This was blowing its cover to smithereens . 
`` The Yanks seemed to have sent it everywhere except Tariq Aziz 's own office , '' remarked a Ministry of Defense official . 
Very few people in London knew about the operation . 
And now all the details , including the real names of the personnel involved , had been broadcast around the world . 
`` We would like your opinion on this matter , '' said the director . 
I did n't hesitate . 
`` Clearly we have to take the best interests of the SCE team itself first . 
This report represents a compromise of their security , which is unacceptable . 
From an Unscom point of view , we must cease the SCE operation immediately . '' 
Whether done on purpose or accident , the American publication of the sensitive details of a covert British intelligence operation , operating under Unscom cover , was an incomprehensible act . 
The US had killed the SCE , so now we had nothing specific to go on . 
We needed high-quality intelligence , without which weapons inspections were going nowhere . 
I had tried my best to develop sources of information , but had been sabotaged by the CIA . 
The failed June 1996 coup attempt had largely been determined by domestic American political considerations . 
Like President George HW Bush before him , Clinton and his political handlers were sensitive to public perception in a presidential election year . 
This shaped both the coup 's mission -LRB- get Saddam -RRB- and its timing -LRB- early summer , before the Republicans had nailed down their candidate -RRB- . 
Not only was the 1996 plot chiefly a `` wag the dog '' scenario , but once again , any chance of Iraq disarming under UN supervision had been cynically undermined by the larger US objective of regime change Ritter discovered that the barracks there belonged to the Radwaniyah Platoon - Saddam 's personal bodyguard , equipped with a fleet of silver Mercedes sedans . 
Two of these cars were badly damaged by machine-gun fire and rocket attack - evidence of a recent assassination attempt on senior regime officials . 
The mystery of the 3rd Battalion This U-2 photograph , provided by the CIA , was taken on June 11 1996 , just as Ritter 's Unscom 150 weapons inspection was getting under way . 
While searching the barracks here , Ritter found files declaring that the 3rd Battalion -LRB- Special Forces -RRB- of the Special Republican Guard had been liquidated and its members placed on `` administrative leave '' . 
Ritter recalled that the 3rd Battalion had earlier been placed `` off limits '' by the CIA . 
`` I now realized what this meant : ` Stay away , those are our guys ' . '' 
The sensitivity of Site 1a led to prolonged stand-offs between weapons inspectors and Iraqi soldiers . 
Intelligence gathered from Unscom 's covert listening post in Baghdad suggested that the vehicles may have been used to move material and documents they did not wish inspectors to find .

2005-09-28,"Nowthatsfuckedup.com is the most horror-filled website I have ever seen ; and if you are reading this at breakfast , or anywhere near a child , you should stop right now . 
It is a site for trophy pictures , originally a place where men could trade pornographic pictures of women they knew . 
But in wartime the definition of trophy changes , so when you look at the forum now you are likely to see something such as this : A burnt and crumpled Arab face rests in a blue kitchen bowl . 
It does n't look as if the back of the head is there , but it 's impossible to be sure because everything behind the eyes is hidden in a pool of blood and everything below the jaw is missing . 
Underneath the picture are two discreet text ads for `` Free amateur teen pictures '' and `` Mother and Daughter omfg ! 
They are whores lol ! '' 
There are several hundred such pictures on the site , all apparently submitted by American soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan . 
The deal offered by the site 's owner , Chris Wilson , is that serving soldiers get free access if they can prove they are abroad . 
He did this from a patriotic impulse : it was difficult for soldiers to make credit card payments from Afghanistan . 
So he decided to accept evidence of life abroad instead . 
This does n't have to be a picture of a mutilated corpse , but those will do nicely . 
The site now has more than 160,000 members . 
The scandal at Abu Ghraib showed that modern armies are full of people with digital cameras who will document everything they see , no matter how shaming it might be in the outside world . 
Some of these pictures are far worse than anything that came out of the prison but they show the same tangle of lust for flesh , power and killing . 
There 's some dispute about whether all of the pictures are real but it seems beyond doubt that most of the posters claiming to be soldiers actually are , not least because the American Army tries to stop its soldiers accessing the site and posting captions like this : `` Iraqi driver tried to run a checkpoint ... this is an Iraqi driver and passenger that tried to run a checkpoint during the first part of OIF -LRB- Operation Iraqi Freedom -RRB- . 
The bad thing about shooting them is that we have to clean it up . 
The car was shot at with 5.56 mm and 7.62 mm rounds . 
The 7.62 did his head '' - but the viewer must take on trust that the head existed . 
The soldier , signing himself `` vagetarian '' , who posted the picture comments : `` These are things that we have to do . 
Some of us dont like it but it must be done to protect ourselfs and our way of life . 
These are here to show we dont take anything lightly . '' 
News of the site has been circulating outside the army for about a month , since Helena Cobban , a Quaker blogger and journalist , found a reference to it in an Italian report . 
`` It underlines the deeply exploitative nature of most pornography , '' she says . 
Wilson , the owner of the site , is proud of displaying the photographs . 
He popped up himself in the discussions on Cobban 's blog to say : `` I think everyone should see them . 
This is a side of the war that is shown from the soldiers THEMSELVES . 
Where else can you go see that ? '' 
He is proud of free expression as a mark of civilisation -LRB- though , for legal reasons , the site is hosted in the Netherlands , and not Florida where he lives -RRB- . 
At the head of each column of pictures is an uplifting paragraph denouncing censorship , which starts : `` America is n't easy . 
America is advanced citizenship . '' 
`` It is '' , says Cobban , `` like finding Mistah Kurtz , sitting in the middle of the black jungle , surrounded by heads on stakes '' Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Shortcuts : The new pornography of war This article appeared on p2 of the G2 section of the Guardian on 15.19 BST on Wednesday 28 September 2005 .

"
2005-10-02,"Why I 'm tearing up my Labor party card The treatment of Walter Wolfgang , after Iraq , proved too much for one long-time supporter I 'm writing to you as the leader of the party from which I am now resigning . 
I joined the Labor party in 1964 but this week is the first time I have felt ashamed of my membership . 
You will say it was an accident that two men were viciously bundled from the conference hall on Wednesday . 
But then you lie as you breathe . 
It is impossible that you do not know that when you took power as Labor leader you were determined to stamp out all public dissent and discussion within the party . 
It is impossible , in a more recent time frame , that you did not know and approve of the decision that there would be no debate on Iraq . 
Even as I write this phrase , its absurdity , its grotesqueness hits me again . 
No debate on Iraq , no debate on the most important foreign policy issue that has confronted Britain since World War Two . 
No debate on Iraq , which has brought such a fear of violence to London . 
No debate on Iraq - on the national disaster with which the names of Guantanamo and Britain will be linked in infamy for our generation and probably beyond . 
It is unthinkable that the Labor party could not debate the Iraqi war . 
But , of course , it is equally unthinkable that it could . 
For the situation there is so dire , the peril in which you have placed the nation is so acute that if even the smallest murmurs of evidence and argument were to be heard they would soon become a gale that would sweep you from office . 
It was telling that you did not even dare to speak to the old geezer they roughed up . 
But you had only to take one look at Walter Wolfgang and you could see Old Labor incarnate . 
An Old Labor that believed in swaying democratic opinion by fact and reason . 
An Old Labor that believed in debate . 
Given 60 seconds in front of the television cameras with Wolfgang and you 'd have been mincemeat . 
You presided over a government which suborned its security services to provide false headlines for you to mislead the Commons into voting for the war . 
Worse , you ignored every lesson of our last imperial disaster in Mesopotamia - a campaign which became a byword for our soldiers being slaughtered to satisfy the vanity of politicians . 
Political parties are institutions which allow debate to be turned into action ; they allow people from different class backgrounds , from different regions , from different races to debate policy knowing that the conclusion of the debate will be the determination of a particular course of action . 
There are no debates now because there is no question about what action will be taken . 
The Chancellor 's peculiarly Presbyterian form of neo-liberalism is absolutely not open for debate . 
If it were , then the scandal of PFI , which represents a continuous tax on the poor by the rich , would be common knowledge . 
Worse in the short term , this lack of debate has allowed no political dissent from the disastrous economic policy of running deficits to fund unproductive investment . 
Old Labor used to run deficits to employ low-paid workers in the unproductive old public sector ; New Labor runs deficits to employ highly-paid consultants in the even more unproductive new public sector . 
In the only industry that I know at first hand , the scale of government handouts is jawdropping . 
New Labor has created a new film body , the Film Council , whose overheads now exceed the production budgets of the very efficient bodies that it replaced . 
There is enormously wasteful duplication of government resources . 
Friends from every sector report the same story . 
It is true that your news management is breathtakingly effective but I do not think this is cause for congratulation . 
You have produced systems of Treasury funding in which there 's always a government nark in the room and you have backed it up with a relentless use of patronage which would make an 18th-century Whig blush . 
No one dares to complain about the Film Council , for example , because they know it will prejudice their next funding application . 
Last week a woman broke down in tears at one of the fringe meetings when she recounted how she could n't talk about Iraq in her constituency . 
Looking at Wolfgang being manhandled from the hall , I was reminded of that chilling footage when Saddam staged his coup in the Baath party at a meeting of the central committee and pointed out the individuals who were to be frogmarched from the room . 
This is Britain , so what awaited Walter Wolfgang outside the conference doors was not a bullet in the head . 
The lady 's tears were caused by her fear of expulsion , not of imprisonment . 
If the method is soft , however , the totalitarian desire to crush debate is hard . 
If Nazi Germany was fascism by radio , New Labor is the corporate state by television . 
The determination to control the party 's image on television is incompatible with a democratic party and , indeed , with democracy . 
I have not been an activist for decades . 
I live in Islington and watching Margaret Hodge and the Loony Left morph effortlessly into New Labor was not a pretty sight . 
Networking with power-mad social climbers was not my idea of the good life . 
I have remained a member of the Labor party , however , because it still seemed to me to be a way of connecting at the national level with people who shared my beliefs in the possibility of a fairer and more equal society . 
Last week has made clear what I 've known but not wanted to admit for at least six years : that you have made it impossible for me to enjoy any such connection . 
For well over a century the Labor party has provided a crucial forum where the marginal and the powerless could speak . 
You have ensured that this is no longer the case . 
The white working class of this country has lost its most important institutional voice as it undergoes the most brutal economic transformation since the Industrial Revolution . 
Indeed , it is clear that you yourself have no belief in any goal of real equality - the New Labor aim , Brown as well as Blair , is just to manage the underclass . 
Of course , there can be no debate . 
When I joined the Labor party I was a schoolboy and I remember learning Kipling 's poem ` Mesopotamia ' by heart . 
It is a savage attack on the politicians who had sent young men to die pointlessly in what is now Iraq . 
In a Labor party defined by its opposition to Suez and opposed to all imperial adventure , it seemed a poem about a far distant past . 
But when I remember it now under a Labor government in the 21st century , it seems directly contemporary . 
You have told the world , to this country 's enduring risk and shame , that Britain will back any American government , no matter how dangerous , in pursuing reckless schemes of military adventure . 
In so doing , you despise all the Labor party 's best traditions . 
Kipling puts it better than I can : -LRB- Your -RRB- lives can not repay us - -LRB- your deaths -RRB- could not undo - The shame that -LRB- you -RRB- have laid upon our race . 
But the slothfulness that wasted and the arrogance that slew , Shall we leave it unabated in its place ?

2005-10-03,"` The cardinal rule ... you do n't target civilians ' Brian Whitaker on a new Human Rights Watch report examining the aims and methods of the insurgency in Iraq Monday 3 October 2005 14.34 BST Aisha Gadafy , the daughter of the Libyan leader , declared her support for insurgents in Iraq last week . 
Opening a conference on human rights in Tripoli , she said : `` Freedom is taken by force and not granted , and the rights of people are taken by their own hands ... What is happening in Iraq can not be ignored by any honest person ... the Iraqi land is occupied , people are dying , scientists are being assassinated and women are being raped . 
`` We salute proudly the fighters of the Iraqi resistance who were able to break the American dream . '' 
Her view is shared by many in the Arab\/Islamic world and beyond , although not necessarily by a majority of ordinary Iraqis . 
`` Districts like Ameriyah have become Jihadi Central , '' Salam Pax , the Baghdad blogger , complained a few days ago . 
`` After they blew up all the clothes shops there , they started blowing up grocery shops , and now they have moved on to shops selling watches . 
Very symbolic , is n't it ? 
Time stops HERE . '' 
Two days before Aisha made her speech , insurgents seized five Shia teachers and their driver as they left a primary school , lined them up against a wall and shot them dead . 
A prominent Shia cleric , Ayatollah Mohammed al-Yaaqubi , responded by adopting the Israeli approach , issuing a religious edict allowing his followers to `` kill terrorists -LRB- or at least people they think might be terrorists -RRB- before they kill '' . 
It is unclear how many civilians have been killed by insurgents in Iraq , although the Iraqi government says there were 1,594 civilian deaths as a result of bombings , assassinations and armed clashes with insurgents during the first six months of this year . 
Deaths among the Iraqi security forces during the same period totalled 895 . 
Those who join insurgent groups have a variety of goals . 
As well as seeking to expel foreign forces from Iraq , some are resisting the marginalisation of Sunni Muslims by the Shia-dominated government , while others are fighting for control of strategic areas such as Kirkuk . 
Some see themselves as being engaged in a global struggle for Islam . 
The killing of civilians by insurgents is not incidental , however , but forms part of an overall strategy . 
This includes : Punishing individuals - drivers , contractors , translators , etc - for collaboration , with the aim of discouraging others from taking on this kind of work . 
Punishing members of religious or ethnic communities , either because they are thought to be co-operating with foreign forces or - in the case of the Kurds and the Shia - because of their influence within Iraq . 
Pressurising foreign governments to abandon Iraq . 
This not only includes nations with military forces in the country , but also others that have merely established diplomatic relations . 
Undermining the Iraqi government by attacking politicians , officials and their families . 
Diverting resources from military tasks in order to protect `` soft '' targets . 
Impeding reconstruction by attacking pipelines , electricity supplies , etc. . 
Provoking a heavy-handed response from the security forces in the hope of winning new recruits . 
These tactics are challenged in a report issued today by Human Rights Watch , which accuses the insurgents of war crimes . 
The laws of war do not outlaw insurgent groups or prohibit attacks on legitimate military targets , the report says - but they restrict the means and manner of attacks and oblige all forces in a conflict to protect civilians and other non-combatants . 
`` There are no justifications for targeting civilians , in Iraq or anywhere else , '' said Sarah Leah Whitson , the Middle East director of Human Rights Watch . 
`` Armed groups as well as governments must respect the laws of war . '' 
The organization , based in Washington , has previously documented abuses by US forces in Iraq as well as torture by the Iraqi police . 
`` US forces have used excessive and indiscriminate force , tortured detainees and held thousands of Iraqis without due process , '' Ms Whitson said . 
`` But that does not justify attacks by insurgent groups that have deliberately targeted and killed civilians . '' 
The 140-page report - entitled A Face and a Name : Civilian Victims of Insurgent Groups in Iraq - examines some of the arguments used by insurgents to justify the killing of civilians . 
In the eyes of one former Iraqi general quoted in the report , `` every Iraqi or foreigner who works with the coalition is a target . 
Ministries , mercenaries , translators , businessmen , cooks or maids , it does n't matter the degree of collaboration . 
To sign a contract with the occupier is to sign your death certificate '' . 
Iraqi government officials `` are all spies , traitors , and agents for the Americans '' , according to a spokesman for the insurgent group Jaysh Muhammad . 
To the head of the pro-Saddam group , Wahaj al-Iraq , the Iraqi parliament and government are `` the institutions of the aggressor '' . 
Shia Muslims , Kurds and Christians are also legitimate targets , according to some insurgents . 
`` The American forces and their intelligence systems have found a safe haven and refuge amongst their brethren the grandchildren of monkeys and swine in Iraq , '' one group said when claiming responsibility for attacking five churches in Mosul and Baghdad . 
Westerners in Iraq - whether contractors , journalists or aid workers - are also considered elements , or potential elements , of a foreign occupation , the report says . 
According to a statement by the Assadullah -LRB- Lion of God -RRB- Brigades , `` the mujahid -LRB- holy fighter -RRB- is entitled to capture any infidel that enters Iraq , whether he works for a construction company or in any other job , because he could be a warrior , and the mujahid has the right to kill him or take him as a prisoner '' . 
An audio tape attributed to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , the leader of al-Qaidain Iraq , went even further : `` The killing of infidels by any method including martyrdom -LRB- suicide -RRB- operations has been sanctified by many scholars even if it means killing innocent Muslims . 
`` This legality has been agreed upon ... so as not to disrupt jihad , '' the speaker said . 
`` The shedding of Muslim blood ... is allowed in order to avoid the greater evil of disrupting jihad . '' 
Coupled with these arguments is a view that because the US has overwhelming technology and firepower , any means of resistance can be justified - including the murder of civilians . 
Some also point to double standards in the application of international law , arguing that insurgent groups should not be expected to respect the law when the other side disregards it . 
None of these justifications is legally defensible , the Human Rights Watch report concludes . 
`` The justifications for attacking specific groups of people misread or misapply the definition of a civilian as it applies under the laws of war , '' it says . 
`` The arguments that international law does not apply -LRB- to insurgent groups -RRB- are contrary to long-accepted understandings of the applicability of the laws of war . 
`` International humanitarian law provides that in all armed conflicts , whether during armed conflicts between states , occupations or civil wars , the parties must at all times distinguish between civilians and combatants . 
`` According to the principle of civilian immunity , attacks may only be directed against combatants , and never civilians . '' 
Elaborating on the legal difference between combatants and civilians , the report continues : `` Civilians are defined as persons who are not members of the armed forces . 
A civilian is protected against attack unless ... he or she takes a direct part in hostilities . 
`` In practice , a civilian would temporarily lose immunity by , for instance , picking up a weapon and engaging in fighting , loading ammunition during a battle or spotting targets for artillery . 
Civilians involved in the planning of military operations or who are giving orders to military forces likewise may be subject to attack . 
`` While a worker in a munitions factory may be assisting the war effort , the absence of direct participation in hostilities means the person can not be subject to attack -LRB- the munitions factory is a legitimate target , however , and the worker bears the risks of being present there -RRB- . '' 
In the Arab world , the invasion of Iraq under false pretences and scandals such as the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib have tended to divert attention from the ruthless brutality of the insurgents . 
`` Because so many people support the cause of the insurgency , they have been unwilling to critique the methods and the means , '' Ms Whitson said . 
`` Whatever your position on the war , the means of doing it is wrong . 
At Human Rights Watch we do n't take a view on the decision to go to war or the decision to resist ... but the cardinal rule is that you do n't target civilians . ''

2005-10-05,"Psychiatrist M Scott Peck , who has died aged 69 , made millions with his first book by advocating self-discipline , restraint , and responsibility - all qualities he openly acknowledged were notably lacking in himself . 
The Road Less Travelled was first published in 1978 . 
It eventually spent 13 years on the New York Times bestseller list to create a paperback record , sold 10 million copies worldwide and was translated into more than 20 languages . 
The opening words were : `` Life is difficult . '' 
This was a pronouncement to which Peck could personally attest . 
He spent much of his life immersed in cheap gin , chain-smoking cigarettes and inhaling cannabis , and being persistently unfaithful to his wife , who eventually divorced him . 
He also went through estrangement with two of his three children . 
Peck wrote openly of his adulterous affairs in another of his total of 15 books : In Search of Stones : A Pilgrimage of Faith , Reason and Discovery -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , based on a visit to Britain to see ancient stone monuments . 
Never lacking in personal honesty , at least in print , he once said he had `` the rare privilege of being able to give advice without having any responsibility '' . 
Peck , whose personalised car number plate was THLOST , also spent much of his life seeking religious fulfilment -LRB- he was baptised a Christian at 43 after embracing Zen and then Sufism -RRB- , and used this to explain his infidelities . 
`` There was an element of quest in my extramarital romances , '' he wrote . 
`` I was questing , through sexual romance , at least a brief visit to God 's castle . '' 
Such visits , however brief , ceased when he became impotent , he disclosed . 
The Road Less Travelled was written while Peck was running a successful private practice in Connecticut , but he received only $ 7,500 for publication after one publisher had dismissed it as `` too Christ-y '' . 
Although a slow starter , its eventual massive success established Peck on the lecture circuit as well as confirming a valuable new genre for American publishers . 
Peck was born in New York , the son of a lawyer who later became a judge . 
His education at the Phillips Exeter academy was unhappy and he later attacked its `` Spartan , almost vicious adolescent culture '' . 
After psychological counselling , he moved to the Friends seminary , a Quaker school near Greenwich Village . 
There he read about Zen and became a Buddhist , but retained an ambition to write `` the great American novel '' . 
After briefly attending Middlebury College , from where he was expelled for refusing the required officers ' training classes , he entered Harvard thanks to his father 's influence . 
He graduated in social relations and , despite his literary desires , began studying medicine at Columbia University before graduating from Case-Western Reserve University school of medicine in Ohio in 1963 . 
While at Columbia Peck met and married Lily Ho , a Chinese student from Singapore . 
This caused his father , who was half Jewish but always concealed it , to disown him -LRB- her parents disapproved , too -RRB- . 
But he later relented and paid his son 's tuition fees . 
Then Peck joined the army because , he later said , he needed the regular pay to support his wife and a family ; yet he also opposed the Vietnam war , then escalating . 
He rose to become assistant chief of psychiatry at the US surgeon general 's office in Washington DC from 1970 to 1972 , when he left the service with the rank of lieutentant colonel . 
Years of private practice began and he incorporated case histories into the Road book and others . 
After its success he followed with another bestseller , People of the Lie : The Hope for Healing Human Evil -LRB- 1983 -RRB- . 
It was well received by critics , but with reservations about `` moral preachment '' . 
His books included two novels and one for children . 
Other non-fiction included The Different Drum -LRB- 1987 -RRB- and sequels to his first book , Further Along the Road Less Travelled -LRB- 1993 -RRB- and The Road Less Traveled and Beyond -LRB- 1997 -RRB- . 
His last work was Glimpses of the Devil -LRB- 2005 -RRB- , recounting his fascination with exorcism . 
The success of his books was partly based on their mystical-spiritual content and although Peck always eschewed the idea of being a guru , there were cultish aspects to his popularity . 
Of this he said : `` Half the time when people want to touch my robe , it feels incredibly icky - yuck ! 
The rest of the time , it feels very good , honest , right . '' 
He and Lily divorced in 2003 and he remarried last year . 
He is survived by his second wife , and his two daughters and one son by Lily .

2005-10-05,"Roberto Benigni is once again testing the boundaries of good taste . 
Having found the funny side of the Holocaust in Life is Beautiful , his latest film sees him on a comic love quest through war-torn contemporary Iraq . 
John Hooper reports from Rome Wednesday 5 October 2005 17.14 BST Please , please laugh ... Critics have suggested that the sympathetic portrayal of US troops in The Tiger and the Snow is a craven appeal to the American box office The Oscar-winning Italian actor-director Roberto Benigni looks certain to stir a lively debate on whether you can mix comedy and carnage when his latest movie is released next week . 
The Tiger and the Snow -LRB- La tigre e la Neve -RRB- is said to be the first full-length feature film to be set in post-invasion Iraq - and its climactic scene is a gag on the theme of suicide bombing . 
But the mix of humor and horror failed to shock the Italian critics who got a first look at the movie this week . 
And that included critics writing for the conservative press which has hitherto been consistently hostile to the left-leaning Benigni . 
`` In the drama of a bombed and invaded Baghdad , weakened by 12 years of embargo , Benigni 's farce finds just the right element of contrast , '' wrote Il Giornale , the Milan daily owned by the family of Italy 's conservative prime minister , Silvio Berlusconi . 
Benigni 's latest film sees him back on the same delicate territory he trod eight years ago in Life is Beautiful , which was partly set in a Nazi concentration camp . 
This time , he plays Attilio , a Rome university lecturer and poet madly , but forlornly , in love with a writer , Vittoria , played by his wife , Nicoletta Braschi . 
Vittoria goes to Baghdad in 2003 to interview Iraq 's leading poet . 
An Allied bombing raid puts the luckless Italian scribe into a coma and Attilio tricks his way into the war-torn country to bring her the medicines she needs but ca n't obtain in a Baghdad hospital . 
Blinded by passion to the risks he is courting , he dodges through minefields and crosses the desert by camel and motorbike . 
The underlying message is the same as that of Life is Beautiful : love conquers all . 
A convinced left-winger , Benigni has been a persistent critic of Italy 's government . 
Mr Berlusconi is a prime supporter of American policy in Iraq where the third-biggest contingent in the US-led coalition is made up of Italian troops . 
Not unnaturally , movie world observers had been expecting Benigni to come up with a pacifist film in which the Americans were the villains . 
Benigni insisted this week that The Tiger and the Snow was `` profoundly '' anti-war and , indeed , the Iraqi poet , Fuad , takes his own life in despair at the chaos brought by the US-led invasion . 
But , Benigni told a press conference in Rome : `` In general , war films appeal to reason , to the head of the viewer . 
This one points at the heart . 
There is no ideology , but for that reason it is stronger . 
The Tiger and the Snow does not takes sides overtly against the US-led invasion and , just as suprisingly perhaps , it shows the American military in a generally sympathetic light . 
Only in one scene , depicting the search of a building , are American troops shown behaving roughly . 
When the movie 's hero appears at a checkpoint , apparently kitted out as a suicide bomber , they lower their guns on hearing he is a poet . 
`` I am not judging them '' , said Benigni . 
`` I know that they are often poor lads without work and without future . 
I feel pity for them . '' 
Several newspapers accused the actor-director of shying away from criticism of the Americans in the hope of repeating the US success of Life is Beautiful , which scooped three Oscars at the 1998 Academy awards . 
But Benigni said it was not his job to sit in judgment . 
Paradoxically , therefore , it could be Italy 's largely pacifist left that finds itself pondering whether to jeer or cheer . 
`` Unrealistic , silly , well-intentioned and opportunistic ? '' 
asked the critic of Italy 's most distinguished left-of-centre daily , La Repubblica . 
She eventually concluded , however , that `` at a time of widespread , apocalyptic pessimism '' , The Tiger and the Snow sent a necessary message : `` Never lose hope , never give in to horror , never accept ruin , fight on , and be certain of making it in the end . '' 
In case you were wondering about the film 's title , it is meant to convey the idea of two things that rarely come together - like war and laughter .

2005-10-07,"Friday 7 October 2005 09.49 BST A senior White House official has denied that the US president , George Bush , said God ordered him to invade Afghanistan and Iraq . 
A spokesman for Mr Bush , Scott McClellan , said the claims , to be broadcast in a TV documentary later this month , were `` absurd '' . 
In the BBC film , a former Palestinian foreign minister , Nabil Shaath , says that Mr Bush told a Palestinian delegation in 2003 that God spoke to him and said : `` George , go and fight these terrorists in Afghanistan '' and also `` George , go and end the tyranny in Iraq '' . 
During a White House press briefing , Mr McClellan said : `` No , that 's absurd . 
He 's never made such comments . '' 
Mr McClellan admitted he was not at the Israeli-Palestinian summit at the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh in June 2003 when Mr Bush supposedly revealed the extent of his religious fervor . 
However , he said he had checked into the claims and `` I stand by what I just said '' . 
Asked if Mr Bush had ever mentioned that God had ordered him into Afghanistan and Iraq , Mr McClellan said : `` No , and I 've been in many meetings with him and never heard such a thing . '' 
The claims are due to be broadcast in a three-part BBC documentary which analyses attempts to bring peace to the Middle East . 
Mr Shaath , the Palestinian foreign minister in 2003 , claims Mr Bush told him and other delegates that he was spoken to by God over his plans for war . 
He told the film-makers : `` President Bush said to all of us : ` I 'm driven with a mission from God . 
God would tell me , George , go and fight those terrorists in Afghanistan . 
And I did , and then God would tell me , George , go and end the tyranny in Iraq ... And I did . '' 
` And now , again , I feel God 's words coming to me , Go get the Palestinians their state and get the Israelis their security , and get peace in the Middle East . 
And by God I 'm gonna do it . ' '' 
The Palestinian leader , Mahmoud Abbas , who attended the June 2003 meeting as well , also appears on the documentary series to recount how Mr Bush told him : `` I have a moral and religious obligation . 
So I will get you a Palestinian state . '' 
Mr Bush , who became a born-again Christian at 40 , is one of the most overtly religious leaders to occupy the White House , a fact that brings him much support in middle America . 
`` History is littered with examples of people doing the most bizarre and sometimes wicked things on this basis , '' said Andrew Blackstock , director of the British-based Christian Socialist Movement . 
`` If Bush really wants to obey God during his time as president he should start with what is blindingly obvious from the Bible rather than perceived supernatural messages . 
`` That would lead him to the rather less glamorous business of prioritising the needs of the poor , the downtrodden and the marginalised in his own country and abroad . 
`` When we see more policies reflecting that , it might be easier to believe he has God on his side . 
And more likely that God might speak to him . '' 
The TV series , which starts on Monday , charts recent attempts to bring peace to the Middle East , from the former US president Bill Clinton 's peace talks in 1999-2000 , to Israel 's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip this year . 
It seeks to uncover what happened behind closed doors by speaking to presidents and prime ministers , along with their generals and ministers , the BBC said .

2005-10-07,"George Bush : ` God told me to end the tyranny in Iraq ' President told Palestinians God also talked to him about Middle East peace George Bush believes he is on a mission from God , according to the politician Nabil Shaath . 
Photograph : Charles Dharapak\/AP George Bush has claimed he was on a mission from God when he launched the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq , according to a senior Palestinian politician in an interview to be broadcast by the BBC later this month . 
Mr Bush revealed the extent of his religious fervor when he met a Palestinian delegation during the Israeli-Palestinian summit at the Egpytian resort of Sharm el-Sheikh , four months after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 . 
One of the delegates , Nabil Shaath , who was Palestinian foreign minister at the time , said : `` President Bush said to all of us : ' I am driven with a mission from God ' . 
God would tell me , ` George go and fight these terrorists in Afghanistan ' . 
And then God would tell me ` George , go and end the tyranny in Iraq ' . 
And I did . '' 
Mr Bush went on : `` And now , again , I feel God 's words coming to me , ` Go get the Palestinians their state and get the Israelis their security , and get peace in the Middle East ' . 
And , by God , I 'm gonna do it . '' 
Mr Bush , who became a born-again Christian at 40 , is one of the most overtly religious leaders to occupy the White House , a fact which brings him much support in middle America . 
Soon after , the Israeli daily newspaper Haaretz carried a Palestinian transcript of the meeting , containing a version of Mr Bush 's remarks . 
But the Palestinian delegation was reluctant publicly to acknowledge its authenticity . 
The BBC persuaded Mr Shaath to go on the record for the first time for a three-part series on Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy : Elusive Peace , which begins on Monday . 
Religion also surfaced as an issue when Mr Bush and Tony Blair were reported to have prayed together in 2002 at his ranch at Crawford , Texas - the summit at which the invasion of Iraq was agreed in principle . 
Mr Blair has consistently refused to admit or deny the claim . 
Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian prime minister , who was also part of the delegation at Sharm el-Sheikh , told the BBC program that Mr Bush had said : `` I have a moral and religious obligation . 
I must get you a Palestinian state . 
And I will . '' 
Mr Shaath 's comments came as Mr Bush delivered a speech yesterday aimed at bolstering US support for the Iraq war . 
He revealed that the US and its partners had disrupted at least 10 serious al-Qaida plots since September 11 , including three planned attacks in the US . 
`` Because of this steady progress , the enemy is wounded - but the enemy is still capable of global operations , '' he said . 
He added that Islamic radicals had used a series of excuses to justify their attacks , from conflict with the Israelis to the Crusades 1,000 years ago . 
`` We 're facing a radical ideology with unalterable objectives : to enslave whole nations and intimidate the world , '' he said . 
He conceded that al-Qaida , led in Iraq by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , and other insurgents had gained ground in Iraq but the US would not leave until security had been established . 
`` Some observers also claim that America would be better off by cutting our losses and leaving Iraq now . 
This is a dangerous illusion , refuted with a simple question : Would the United States and other free nations be more safe , or less safe , with Zarqawi and Bin Laden in control of Iraq , its people , and its resources ? '' 
"
2005-10-09,"Liberals will blame anybody else for atrocities rather than accuse murderous Islamic terrorists There are plenty of signs that Paris could be next . 
French intelligence agents found a message on an Arabic website from the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat , a demented Algerian outfit which is close to al-Qaeda . 
France was ` our first enemy ' , the terrorists said . 
The ` only way to discipline France is jihad , martyrdom and Islam ' . 
At the end of last month , French police arrested nine alleged Islamists in a suburb of Paris and claimed they were planning to bomb the Metro . 
Nicolas Sarkozy , the French Interior minister , said the risk of an attack was currently ` at a very high level ' . 
Marc Hecker , from the French Institute for International Relations , said it was ' a real error ' to believe that France would be left in peace because President Chirac opposed the Iraq War . 
But as it 's impossible to blame Iraq , what or who will get the blame if the rucksacks start exploding at the Gare du Nord ? 
Will the liberal world look Islamism in the face and see a cult of slaughter and self-slaughter powered by messianic faith , the Jewish conspiracy theory of European fascism , imperialist dreams of world domination and a loathing of democracy , pluralism , religious tolerance and the emancipation of women ? 
I live in hope , but the record suggests everyone but the perpetrators will be held responsible . 
If the French ca n't be blamed for their part in the downfall of Chirac 's old friend , Saddam Hussein , then maybe their support for the Algerian government will be used to explain the killings . 
How about the ban of headscarves in French schools ? 
My money is on the headscarves but , frankly , the favored ` root cause ' could be the effect of the Common Agricultural Policy on poor world farmers or the provocation given by bikini-wearing holidaymakers at Club Med resorts in North Africa or the behavior of French paratroopers during the Algerian War of Independence in the 1950s . 
If you think I 'm exaggerating , consider the attempts to show that the bombs in Bali were the fault of liberal democracies . 
Before a single fact on the motives of the killers was available , the Independent on Sunday declared : ` There can be little doubt that the bombs in Bali are linked to issues surrounding the war . 
It is no coincidence that Australia , whose citizens are likely to be the majority of the victims , is fully committed in Iraq . ' 
Actually , there could be a great deal of doubt , not least because the majority of the dead were Indonesian Hindus , who I assume the Islamists were happy to designate as pagans before murdering them . 
Pamela Nowicka of Tourism Concern , which campaigns for eco-friendly holidays , had doubts of her own . 
She decided that what mattered was that the dead tourists were tourists rather than Australians . 
` Many in the global south regard tourism as a new form of colonialism and cultural imperialism , ' she wrote in the Guardian . 
` While that may be hard for the suntanned holidaymaker to take on board , for the millions of ordinary people servicing their needs - the waiting staff , room cleaners , receptionists , shop workers , guides , massage ladies and taxi drivers - the linkage is clearer . ' 
Except that the bombers were n't disgruntled room cleaners and taxi drivers . 
They were members of a totalitarian movement which is against every principle Ms Nowicka professes to support . 
The first economic consequence of their killings will be to put cleaners and taxi drivers out of work . 
I could go on - Mark Curtis , a historian from the Noam Chomsky school , wrote a piece which blamed the bombs on British support for General Suharto 's coup a mere 40 years ago - but what needs saying is that no mainstream commentator mentioned that we have the grievance of Indonesian Islamists on the record . 
It has nothing to do with the foreign policy of the first Wilson administration or stingy tipping in Bali 's restaurants . 
After the 2002 explosions in Bali killed 200 , Osama bin Laden declared : ` Australia is the one that we have warned before not to participate in Afghanistan , not to mention its continued awful chapter in East Timor . 
They ignored our warning and they woke up to the sound of explosions in Bali . ' 
My guess is that people do n't want to look at al-Qaeda 's condemnations of Australia 's role in saving -LRB- largely Catholic -RRB- East Timor from destruction by the militias of -LRB- largely Muslim -RRB- Indonesia . 
It 's too frightening to contemplate ; it takes you into the darkness to confront Islamism 's impossible and therefore unappeasable demand for a caliphate and reminds you of its imperial urge to dominate Muslims and subjugate all others . 
Avoidance of what al-Qaeda stands for began in 9\/11 and has become endemic since . 
My favorite piece of victim blaming was after the Madrid bombings . 
For a few hours , there was a rumor that they were the work of ETA and Eddie Mair , the presenter of Radio 4 's PM news show , duly had a go at a representative of the Spanish government , alleging that Madrid 's refusal to talk to Basque nationalists was the root cause of the atrocity . 
By the next day , it was clear that Islamists , not Basques , had attacked Madrid . 
Without pausing for breath , Mair duly wanted to know if the presence of Spanish troops in Iraq was the root cause of the atrocity . 
The identity of the bombers was irrelevant . 
The Spanish had to be the cause of their own suffering . 
Perhaps it is too easy to mock . 
When confronted with an ideology which mandates indiscriminate killing on an industrial scale , it is natural to seek rational explanations of the irrational ; to pretend that Islamism is merely a reasonable , if bloody , response to legitimate concerns which could be remedied if we elected wiser leaders . 
Yet the masochism - ` Kill us , we deserve it ! ' 
- the subliminal dislike of democracy and the willingness to turn al-Qaeda into the armed wing of every fashionable campaign from sustainable tourism to the anti-war movement will in the end disgrace the liberals by making them ridiculous . 
Charles Clarke should learn that clarity does n't begin at Home The Home Office is attempting the revolutionary tactic of treating the British public as adults . 
This may be foolish . 
The only adult thing about millions of British voters is that they are over 18 . 
None the less , it was cheering to see Charles Clarke publish vast amounts of supporting evidence last week to explain why he wanted to hold suspects without charge for three months . 
For years now , the government has felt no need to justify its assaults on civil liberties . 
It has simply dismissed its critics as ` BMW-driving , civil-liberties lawyers ' and other decadent dilettantes . 
The act of writing out a justification destroys self-delusion by forcing you to be clear . 
I 'm not sure if it will help sell other Home Office policies . 
How would an honest description of its ban on the incitement to religious hatred read ? 
` We are so worried about religious extremists that we want to give them the chance to send their critics to prison . ' 
A bit windy , perhaps . 
Let 's try : ` We 'll fight religious bigotry by protecting religious bigotry . ' 
Nearer the mark , I think , and more succinct . 
On identity cards , intellectual clarity would demand that Mr Clarke begins : ` We 're so worried by crime , terrorism and illegal immigration that we want to impose a new law-and-order tax on the public . 
Our estimate is it will raise # 6 billion . 
Others say # 18bn . 
Let 's split the difference and call it # 12bn . 
Now we wo n't spend it on capturing criminals , terrorists and illegal immigrants . 
That would be mad . 
Rather than wasting money on new police officers , we will force people who are n't criminals , terrorists and illegal immigrants to carry an expensive piece of plastic . ' 
Does it work for you ? 
I do n't think the new openness will last . 
As a true friend of the Home Office , I advise it to go back to its traditional policy of always complain , never explain . 
"
2005-10-11,"' I was a woman in a warrior 's world ' General Janis Karpinski was commander of Abu Ghraib prison when the abuse scandal erupted . 
In a memoir out this week she reveals her fury at being made the scapegoat I rarely fell asleep in Baghdad . 
I would collapse on my bunk , pass out from the heat for a few hours , then drag myself out for a pre-dawn run , while it was still only 27C-32C . 
Army leaders did not seem to want me to run , but I ran anyway . 
The senior warriors seeing this reserve general , a woman , running at 4.30 am decided to do something - or maybe it was just a coincidence that they kept changing the rules . 
When they announced that personnel - women especially - were no longer to run by themselves , I had to stifle a laugh . 
Eventually they decided women could run , but not before 6 . 
What was the army protecting me from in this secure base ? 
I continued my pre-dawn runs . 
The 800th Military Police Brigade , which I commanded , was one of a patchwork of reserve units that had come to Iraq to hold prisoners of war . 
But we were now being sent to Baghdad to help restore the Iraqi civilian prison system - a mission the brigade never had prepared for . 
Working in decimated facilities with inadequate supplies and incarcerating robbers , murderers and suspected terrorists was not in our playbook . 
But it was our job . 
We would operate under the auspices of the task force commanded by General Ricardo Sanchez . 
Some commanders , no matter their appearance , radiate dynamism and leadership . 
Sanchez , a dour-looking individual , did not . 
When I went to meet him , the message I got was : over my dead body this female is going to be in charge of all the police operations in this country . 
It turned out that there was one other female general on the ground : a one-star who ran the intelligence staff for Sanchez . 
But I was commanding troops in a combat zone - and that was tough for the combat generals to take . 
Our `` interim '' facility at Abu Ghraib was morphing into our maximum prison for all of Iraq . 
In the summer of 2003 , we had 700-800 prisoners . 
By September , nearly 3,000 . 
By the autumn , 7,000 . 
In short , Abu Ghraib was working well . 
Within a month after taking our first prisoners there , the leader of the military intelligence -LRB- MI -RRB- brigade at the prison , Colonel Thomas Pappas , came to see me . 
His MI specialists were interrogating security detainees 24\/7 . 
His teams harangued the prisoners , and he in turn was harangued by Sanchez to get better information . 
The creeping MI takeover of Abu Ghraib culminated in November , when Sanchez issued an order for the 205th MI brigade , under Pappas , to take tactical control of Abu Ghraib . 
The chain of command was murky . 
I was still in charge of the MP -LRB- military policemen -RRB- guards , but from then on Pappas controlled the life of what had become an intelligence and interrogation center . 
It is still hard to believe that , within a month , the seasoned soldiers of the 372nd MP company , with a previous deployment to Bosnia under their belts , would perpetrate prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib that would shock the world and severely damage America 's standing in the Middle East . 
I can only speculate about what might have happened . 
The MPs of the 372nd found themselves supervising security detainees . 
While these MPs had never handled such prisoners before , the civilian MI interrogators came to the job with worlds of experience and a mandate to crack down . 
The interrogators enlisted the MPs in their cause , a trick imported from Guantnamo . 
Soldiers who had been trained to treat prisoners humanely now heard praise for softening up the interrogation subjects . 
Good job keeping the lights on all night ; good job blasting music incessantly . 
Good job because they 're really talking now . 
No MPs would have known anything about the more sophisticated techniques employed by the intelligence specialists . 
These were aimed at Middle-Eastern Muslim prisoners in particular : the shame of being seen naked , of having a woman see them without clothes , the humiliation of wearing women 's underwear , the fear of dogs . 
Only experienced intelligence operatives could have told the MPs to use such techniques . 
Unfortunately , in Specialist Charles Graner , they found an enthusiastic disciple . 
Graner enlisted his girlfriend , Lynndie England , whom he knew would readily join in the sexual humiliation . 
His supervisor , Staff Sergeant Ivan Frederick , joined in , and the company 's more senior NCOs and officers , who should have seen what was happening , did n't . 
I never had the slightest idea that anything out of the ordinary was happening . 
Neither soldiers nor prisoners reported any infractions , or raised any concerns . 
In retrospect , I have asked myself whether I was tough enough with these subordinates and in my whole approach to leadership in Abu Ghraib . 
Did I spend too much effort trying to take care of my soldiers and devote too little attention to training and disciplining them ? 
When interrogators encouraged these young MPs to `` soften up '' suspected terrorists , they had no relevant training to fall back on . 
Neither Pappas nor I knew what had been happening in cellblock 1A . 
One night in December , an MP named Specialist Joseph Darby was sent there to drop off a document . 
Darby saw a couple of naked detainees and made a hasty exit . 
Then , as he was looking through a disk of images Graner had given him for a record of the unit 's service in Iraq , Darby came upon some of the shocking photos . 
He later slipped a disk under the door of the criminal investigation field office at Abu Ghraib . 
When an agent examined it , he was floored , and the scandal unfolded . 
What could I have done to stop the abuse before it started ? 
Why did I not see something like this coming ? 
When I formally reported to General Sanchez , the commander said not a word . 
I said , `` Sir , when I saw the pictures I was absolutely sickened by them . 
I thought I was going to throw up . '' 
He put his hand up to stop me . 
`` Do you have any idea what this will do to my army ? '' 
`` Sir , I ca n't even begin to understand what these soldiers were thinking . '' 
Again he put up his hand . 
`` This is unacceptable , '' he said . 
He had to be worrying about protecting himself . 
Two months earlier , he had taken away authority over Abu Ghraib -LRB- but not the other prisons -RRB- from me , and handed it to his own intelligence officer , who acted through Colonel Pappas , the intelligence man on the scene . 
Under pressure from Washington to increase the flow of `` actionable intelligence '' against a growing Iraqi insurgency , he had , in effect , cut me out and taken direct control . 
But now things were going sour , he was staking down a sacrificial lamb . 
I did n't leave my meeting with Sanchez chastened . 
All of my career , I had wanted nothing but to serve as a soldier , yet time and again I found myself singled out not as a rising officer , but as a woman . 
Here I was back in that role I could not shake : the woman in a warrior 's world . 
There had to be a prominent scapegoat , and how could I have not seen who it would be ? 
Following Major General Taguba 's investigation , I was formally relieved of my command . 
But President Bush delivered a blow I had not expected at all - vacating my promotion to general and demoting me to colonel . 
It is immensely difficult to accept these verdicts of dishonor from my government and my army , when I know in my heart I do not deserve them . 
Yet I remain immensely proud of my service . 
I was made for a life in the military , and I hope my experiences will ease the way for the women who will follow me in that career .

2005-10-13,"` Either you are with us , or you are with the terrorists , '' President George Bush told the world after September 11 2001 , and he has made it clear ever since that he means it . 
But in that black and white universe , where do you put Josh Rushing ? 
Rushing is a blue-eyed son of Texas , a marine for all his adult life whose clean-cut friendly charm made him the ideal public face for the US military during the Iraq invasion . 
But he has now joined the Arab television channel al-Jazeera as an `` on-screen personality '' , a move which , in the eyes of many Americans , is one step short of signing up with al-Qaida . 
The US defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , has accused the Qatar-based satellite channel of lying to the world and spouting terrorist propaganda . 
Its journalists have been boycotted by American officials and thrown out of Iraq . 
One of its reporters has recently been jailed for seven years by a Spanish court for collaborating with al-Qaida . 
In joining al-Jazeera 's forthcoming English-language service , Rushing points out that he is in good journalistic company . 
He will be surrounded by former BBC employees , including Sir David Frost . 
But they are Europeans and journalists , two species generally associated with perfidy in the minds of the American right . 
Rushing is an American and a marine . 
For many conservatives here , he has joined a pantheon of turncoats alongside Benedict Arnold -LRB- who switched to the British side halfway through the war of independence -RRB- and `` Tokyo Rose '' -LRB- who broadcast for the Japanese in the second world war -RRB- . 
The conservative blogs hum with bile . 
The comments on freerepublic.com include : `` He was crap to begin with - he stinks even worse now . 
He is no longer an American '' . 
Another writes : `` He is a leftist , terrorist sympathiser who infiltrated the US marines . 
Now he is home '' . 
A third adds : `` I sure hope he do n't have some kinda accident or sumtin -LRB- sic -RRB- ... '' There have been quite a few along the lines of that last remark , enough for the former marine captain to take a few security precautions at his new Washington home , and he admits to feeling the strain . 
`` It 's kind of hard for a guy who 's dedicated his entire adult life to the health and wellbeing of this country to be called a traitor by people who , I feel , have probably sacrificed a lot less than I have , '' he said . 
He was talking in an elegant and quiet corner of Washington 's Army and Navy Club , where he still enjoys privileges , despite his choice of employer . 
He dresses in the manner of many former officers on both sides of the Atlantic - a tweed jacket over a boldly striped shirt - and has the crispness in his talk and the direct gaze drilled into him at marine charm school . 
Those qualities , plus his degree in classic civilisations and ancient history , got him the job of presenting the Pentagon 's side of the Iraq war to the local media in Qatar 's capital , Doha . 
It made him an unwitting star . 
An Egyptian-American film-maker , Jehane Noujaim , was hanging around the media center with a video camera , and most of the officers , including the then Lieutenant Rushing , thought she was making a student film about media coverage of the war . 
But her documentary , Control Room , became one of last year 's surprise hits . 
The film is a largely sympathetic portrayal of al-Jazeera , but it also shines a bright light on the multi-million dollar publicity machine the Pentagon built in Doha . 
Among all the gung-ho on-message military information officers , Lt Rushing stuck out . 
He listened to what some of the Arab journalists were saying about the war and appeared to reconsider some of his assumptions . 
In one memorable scene , he declared himself sickened by al-Jazeera 's decision to screen pictures of dead Americans , but then realized he was not as outraged to see Iraqi bodies on the same network the following evening . 
`` It upset me on a profound level that I was n't bothered as much as the night before , '' he said in the film . 
`` It makes me hate war . '' 
The film caused an uproar , and abuse from military and militaristic types began to flood in . 
His favorite was : `` Six months in the desert does n't make you fucking Lawrence of Arabia . '' 
Rushing recalls : `` I saved that one , because I do n't claim to be Lawrence of Arabia - just a guy who says it may be worth us trying to understand their perspective . '' 
Displaying an apparently genuine innocence , he still can not understand why the defense department was annoyed by the film , and why he was subsequently forbidden to talk to the press . 
`` The Pentagon missed an opportunity with my case in that movie , '' he says . 
`` I would have liked to have come out and said that there are a lot of people in the military that would have reacted in the same way in that film , trying to understand the other side and wanting to do the right thing . '' 
He left the marines last August and spent some miserable months , unemployed and eating into his modest savings , before he accepted al-Jazeera 's offer . 
The danger Rushing now faces is that he may be accused of going from one one-sided media operation to another . 
After all , he is shown in Control Room criticising al-Jazeera 's bias , comparing it to Fox News `` at the other end of the spectrum '' . 
He admits that he is unaware whether al-Jazeera 's Arabic broadcasts have got any better . 
`` I do n't know where they 're at right now . 
I do n't get a chance to watch it , and if I could I do n't understand it , '' he says . 
`` I think there 's going to be a difficult time overcoming the brand in America . '' 
It may turn out to be impossible . 
The new English-language al-Jazeera International has yet to find a US cable outlet prepared to carry its broadcasts .

2005-10-18,"Are we going to war with Iran ? 
Dan Plesch evaluates the evidence pointing towards a new conflict in the Middle East Tuesday 18 October 2005 12.01 BST The Sunday Telegraph warned last weekend that the UN had a last chance to avert war with Iran and , at a meeting in London last week , the US ambassador to the UN , John Bolton , expressed his regret that any failure by the UN security council to deal with Iran would damage the security council 's relevance , implying that the US would solve the problem on its own . 
Only days before , the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , had dismissed military action as `` inconceivable '' while both the American president and his secretary of state had insisted war talk was not on the agenda . 
The UN 's International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors have found that Iran has not , so far , broken its commitments under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty , although it has concealed activities before . 
It appears that the UK and US have decided to raise the stakes in the confrontation with Iran . 
The two countries persuaded the IAEA board - including India - to overrule its inspectors , declare Iran in breach of the non-proliferation treaty -LRB- NPT -RRB- and say that Iran 's activities could be examined by the UN security council . 
Critics of this political process point to the fact that India itself has developed nuclear weapons and refused to join the NPT , but has still voted that Iran is acting illegitimately . 
On the Iranian side there is also much belligerent talk and pop music now proudly speaks of the nuclear contribution to Iranian security . 
The timing of the recent allegations about Iranian intervention in Iraq also appears to be significant . 
Ever since the US refused to control Iraq 's borders in April 2003 , Iranian backed militia have dominated the south and , with under 10,000 soldiers amongst a population of millions , the British army had little option but to go along . 
No fuss was made until now . 
As for the bombings of British soldiers , some sources familiar with the US army engineers report that these supposedly sophisticated devices have been manufactured inside Iraq for many months and do not need to be imported . 
But is the war talk for real or is it just sabre rattling ? 
The conventional wisdom is that for both military and political reasons it would be impossible for Israel and the UK\/US to attack and that , in any event , after the politically damaging Iraq war , neither Tony Blair nor George Bush would be able to gather political support for another attack . 
But in Washington , Tel Aviv and Downing Street , if not the Foreign Office , Iran is regarded as a critical threat . 
The regime in Tehran continues to demand the destruction of the state of Israel and to support anti-Israeli forces . 
In what appeared to be coordinated releases of intelligence assessments , Israeli and US intelligence briefed earlier this year that , while Iran was years from a nuclear weapons capability , the technological point of no return was now imminent . 
Shortly after the US elections , the vice-president , Dick Cheney , warned that Israel might attack Iran . 
Israel has the capability to attack Iranian targets with aircraft and long-range cruise missiles launched from submarines , while Iranian air defences are still mostly based on 25-year-old equipment purchased in the time of the Shah . 
A US attack might be portrayed as a more reasonable option than a renewed Israeli-Islamic confrontation . 
The US army and marines are heavily committed in Iraq , but soldiers could be found if the Bush administration were intent on invasion . 
Donald Rumsfeld has been reorganising the army to increase front-line forces by a third . 
More importantly , naval and air force firepower has barely been used in Iraq . 
Just 120 B52 and stealth bombers could target 5,000 points in Iran with satellite-guided bombs in just one mission . 
It is for this reason that John Pike of globalsecurity.org thinks that a US attack could come with no warning at all . 
US action is often portrayed as impossible , not only because of the alleged lack of firepower , but because Iranian facilities are too hard to target . 
In a strategic logic not lost on Washington , the conclusion then is that if you can not guarantee to destroy all the alleged weapons , then it must be necessary to remove the regime that wants them , and regime change has been the official policy in Washington for many years . 
For political-military planners , precision strikes on a few facilities have drawbacks beyond leaving the regime intact . 
They allow the regime too many retaliatory options . 
Certainly , Iran 's neighbors in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf who are worried about the growth of Iranian Shia influence in Iraq would want any attack to be decisive . 
From this logic grows the idea of destroying the political-military infrastructure of the clerical regime and perhaps encouraging separatist Kurdish and Azeri risings in the north-west . 
Some Washington planners have hopes of the Sunnis of oil-rich Khuzestan breaking away too . 
A new war may not be as politically disastrous in Washington as many believe . 
Scott Ritter , the whistleblowing former UN weapons inspector , points out that few in the Democratic party will stand in the way of the destruction of those who conducted the infamous Tehran embassy siege that ended Jimmy Carter 's presidency . 
Mr Ritter is one of the US analysts , along with Seymour Hersh , who have led the allegations that Washington is going to war with Iran . 
For an embattled President Bush , combating the mullahs of Tehran may be a useful means of diverting attention from Iraq and reestablishing control of the Republican party prior to next year 's congressional elections . 
From this perspective , even an escalating conflict would rally the nation behind a war president . 
As for the succession to President Bush , Bob Woodward has named Mr Cheney as a likely candidate , a step that would be easier in a wartime atmosphere . 
Mr Cheney would doubtless point out that US military spending , while huge compared to other nations , is at a far lower percentage of gross domestic product than during the Reagan years . 
With regard to Mr Blair 's position , it would be helpful to know whether he has committed Britain to preventing an Iranian bomb `` come what may '' as he did with Iraq .

2005-10-18,"UK attacks presence at conference on hunger PM and Bush likened to Axis leaders over Iraq war Britain expressed outrage yesterday after Robert Mugabe took advantage of a United Nations ceremony in Rome to compare Tony Blair to Italy 's wartime dictator , Benito Mussolini . 
Departing from his prepared text at the 60th anniversary celebrations of the UN 's biggest agency , the Food and Agriculture Organisation , the Zimbabwean leader described the prime minister and the US president , George Bush , as `` international terrorists '' . 
He also denounced their invasion of Iraq , saying they were `` the two unholy men of our millennium who , in the same way as Hitler and Mussolini formed -LRB- an -RRB- unholy alliance , formed an alliance to attack an innocent country '' . 
Matthew Wyatt , Britain 's representative at the FAO , said Mr Mugabe 's presence at a conference on food and hunger was a `` sick irony '' . 
He told the Guardian : `` It is extremely unfortunate that Mugabe was at this occasion . 
He has created hunger and poverty in his own country . '' 
Aid groups have estimated that five million of Zimbabwe 's 12 million people may need food aid this year . 
Mr Mugabe 's policies , including the forcible redistribution of white-owned farms , have been widely criticised for plunging the country into its deepest economic crisis since independence . 
Mr Mugabe said that his land reforms had been needed to redress `` gross imbalances '' left by colonialism . 
Mr Wyatt said that he and other delegates had gone to the anniversary celebrations `` to remind ourselves that there are , by the FAO 's estimate , 852 million hungry people , and that we face a huge challenge meeting the millennium development goals . 
Having somebody like Mugabe present was entirely inappropriate . 
It would have been better for all of us - the FAO included - if he had not come . '' 
His outrage was echoed by that of his US counterpart , Tony Hall , who described the Zimbabwean president as someone who `` chews up his own people and spits them out '' . 
That was clearly not the view of some of the other delegates who repeatedly applauded Mr Mugabe 's fiery anti-western diatribe . 
Flanked by bodyguards , the Zimbabwean leader declared : `` The voice of Mr Bush and the voice of Mr Blair ca n't decide who shall rule in Zimbabwe , who shall rule in Africa , who shall rule in Asia , who shall rule in Venezuela , who shall rule in Iran , who shall rule in Iraq . '' 
His reference to Venezuela was well received by Hugo Chvez , who told Italy 's Ansa news agency : `` I pay tribute to Mugabe . '' 
The Venezuelan president added : `` The president of Zimbabwe is made out to be a villain - because he takes land from those who do n't need it to give it to those who need it to live . '' 
British and US officials acknowledged that customarily the FAO invites the heads of state of all its member nations to such events . 
But yesterday 's rumpus is bound to fuel growing disquiet in London and Washington over the course being taken by the agency under the leadership of its Senegalese director general , Jacques Diouf , who has been in place since 1994 ; next month he will stand unopposed for a third term of office . 
President Mugabe yesterday thanked the director general for having invited him despite objections made by the US . 
American officials said last month that they were preparing to place travel restrictions on Mr Mugabe , his government and family . 
The ban is expected to be similar to one imposed by the EU following claims that the Zimbabwean government was involved in vote-rigging in the 2000 and 2002 elections . 
Under an agreement with the FAO , Italy does not impose any restrictions on delegates visiting the agency . 
However , the head of the Italian parliament 's agriculture committee , Sergio Agoni , said it was `` scandalous that Robert Mugabe should be coming to speak about food at a time when his compatriots are dying in the streets for lack of foodstuffs and human rights '' . 
Mr Mugabe also enjoys immunity for visits to the Vatican ; earlier this year , he exploited to the full his attendance at the funeral of Pope John Paul II . 
Placed close to the Prince of Wales , he leaned over and shook the prince 's hand during the service . 
The prince 's household said afterwards that he had been taken by surprise .

2005-10-19,"Wednesday 19 October 2005 18.57 BST Former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein goes on trial in Baghdad today charged with killing 148 people in Dujail following an assassination attempt on him during a visit to the village . 
He may also face charges in relation to other alleged atrocities committed in the country , as detailed in the following reports from the Guardian archive . 
1974 : At least five Shia religious leaders are killed and possibly dozens more . 
1970s - 2003 : 270 mass graves are found , leading to charges of the killing of tens of thousands of people . 
1983 : 8,000 male members of the Kurdish Barzani tribe in the northern province of Arbil are arrested and deported to southern Iraq . 
No trace of them has ever been found . 
1988 : The Anfal -LRB- ` Spoils ' -RRB- campaign is designed to depopulate the Kurdish regions in northern Iraq . 
Up to 182,000 people are killed or die from cold and hunger and entire villages are razed . 
"
2005-10-19,"October 19 2005 , Eyewitness : The first Saddam trial will focus on the 143 villagers of Dujail , killed in 1982 after a failed assassination attempt -LRB- scroll down to read more -RRB- . 
Dujail was bombed from the air , its palm trees and orange groves razed and thousands of men , women and children were arrested . 
At least 143 men were executed . 
Amid a grinding , bloodsoaked war with Iran , in which Iraq was tacitly backed by the west , few outside the town knew or cared about the price it paid for defying Saddam . 
Today , more than two decades later , the former president and seven officials will be tried for allegedly ordering and overseeing the killings at Abu Ghraib prison . 
If convicted they could be hanged . 
Saddam faces another 11 trials , including charges related to the gassing and mass executions of the Kurds in the late 1980s and the suppression of a Shia uprising in 1991 . 
Prosecutors have started with Dujail in the hope it will be a simpler , tighter case with a paper trail allegedly linking the killings to the Ba'athist regime leadership . 
Survivors have given witness statements and some may testify in person . 
A curtain has been erected around the witness box for those wishing to hide their identity . 
Dujail is divided over its sudden prominence . 
Some residents express pride but others are fearful - insurgents have kidnapped and killed inhabitants in apparent revenge for the trial . 
The town is Shia but the surrounding area is Sunni Arab , the rival sect which dominated Iraq under Saddam and now forms the core of the insurgency . 
The would-be assassins in 1982 supported the Dawa party , a Shia group with ties to Iran , now one of the leading parties in Iraq 's ruling coalition . 
It would be one of the great ironies if the gunmen who missed the president on that hot day in July posthumously achieved their objective . 
"
2005-10-20,"The Guardian 's Iraq correspondent , Rory Carroll , was last night missing after being kidnapped by gunmen in Baghdad . 
Carroll , 33 , an experienced foreign correspondent , had been conducting an interview in the city with a victim of Saddam Hussein 's regime . 
He had been preparing an article for today 's paper on the opening of the former dictator 's trial yesterday . 
Carroll , who was accompanied by two drivers and a translator , was confronted by the gunmen as he left the house where he had been carrying out the interview . 
He and one of the drivers were bundled into cars . 
The driver was released about 20 minutes later . 
Carroll has been in Iraq since January . 
He volunteered for the assignment and his coverage has been critical of the US-led coalition . 
Before Iraq , he had been the paper 's correspondent in Africa , based in Johannesburg , since 2002 . 
In the previous three years he had been based in Rome , where he covered the aftermath of the Kosovo war . 
He was born in Dublin , attended university there and worked for various Irish papers before moving to London . 
He has an Irish passport . 
The Irish government was last night in contact with its embassies throughout the Middle East to try to secure help in finding him . 
Alan Rusbridger , the Guardian 's editor , said : `` We 're deeply concerned at Rory 's disappearance . 
He is in Iraq as a professional journalist - and he 's a very good , straight journalist whose only concern is to report fairly and truthfully about the country . 
We urge those holding him to release him swiftly - for the sake of his family and for the sake of anyone who believes the world needs to be kept fully informed about events in Iraq today . ''

2005-10-21,"The Guardian profile : Lord Steyn He 's woven the Human Rights Act into our legal system . 
He has a terrier-like tenacity and the courage of a lion Free from judicial shackles , the retired law lord is speaking his mind as the new chairman of Justice In his 10 years as a law lord , Johan Steyn never opened his mouth in the chamber of the House of Lords . 
He thinks judges should play no part in parliament . 
Throughout his years on the bench , his strongly held views on democracy , basic human rights , free speech and the rule of law made themselves heard , but only through his court judgments , lectures to lawyers and fellow judges , and articles in academic journals . 
This week , at the age of 73 , he cast off his judicial shackles and , as the newly installed chairman of the human rights group Justice , branded as `` a fairy tale '' Tony Bair 's insistence that the war in Iraq has not made London and the world more dangerous . 
He recalled the prime minister 's pronouncement - heralding new terrorism laws - that after July 7 , `` the rules of the game are changing '' : Steyn 's response was `` to state without equivocation that the maintenance of the rule of law is not a game . 
It is about access to justice , fundamental human rights and democratic values . '' 
He went on to attack the `` flood '' of criminal justice legislation . 
`` Year after year , half-baked ideas are adopted in haste , puffed up to be the ideal solution and routinely abandoned a year later . '' 
He agreed with his predecessor as Justice chairman , Lord Alexander of Weedon , that the Iraq war was unlawful and `` in its search for a justification in law for war the government was driven to scrape the bottom of the legal barrel '' . 
And , finally , the coup de grce : `` After the dreadful bombings in London we were asked to believe that the Iraq war did not make the world a more dangerous place . 
Surely , on top of everything else , we do not have to listen to a fairy tale . '' 
Retirement frees judges to speak their mind , but few have been so outspoken . 
And Steyn made headlines even as a serving judge . 
Take November 2003 , when the media picked up a lecture to lawyers in which he branded the US regime at Guantnamo Bay `` a monstrous failure of justice '' , and the system of trial by military tribunal `` a kangaroo court which makes a mockery of justice '' . 
His words went round the world . 
Two years before that , when Britain introduced executive detention without trial , his response was to deliver another of his trenchant lectures to lawyers and judges . 
He expressed the view that the UK opt-out from the European convention on human rights , which the government had to do to bring in the legislation , was `` not , in the present circumstances , justified '' . 
It was enough to get him removed , at the government 's insistence , from the panel of law lords hearing a challenge by Belmarsh detainees to the lawfulness of the opt-out . 
Steyn is a leading advocate of the principle that judges should not defer to parliament and ministers simply because politicians are accountable to the electorate . 
Judges too have a duty to the public , he argues , and should not simply take ministers ' word for it , but should probe and seek evidence . 
His judgments had the same flavor . 
Of the extension of `` special advocates '' - who can see secret evidence but not discuss it with the `` client '' they represent , from terrorism to parole cases - he said : `` The special advocate procedure strikes at the root of the prisoner 's fundamental right to a basically fair procedure . '' 
His reverence for the rule of law and basic human rights springs from his experience of growing up and practising as a lawyer in apartheid South Africa . 
The son of an eminent law professor at Stellenbosch , he grew up a bookish child and went to Oxford as a Rhodes scholar . 
He returned to South Africa and established a practice at the bar in 1958 , leaving in 1973 because of his opposition to apartheid . 
He was surprised to be appointed a high court judge in 1985 by the Tory lord chancellor Lord Hailsham . 
He wonders whether Hailsham got the wrong chap , because when they met later he repeatedly called him Charles . 
Jeffrey Jowell , professor of public law at University College London , says that in the appeal court and Lords , Steyn 's judgments in cases involving prisoners and asylum seekers `` were paradigm shifts in thinking at the time '' . 
Anthony Lester , the human rights QC and Liberal Democrat peer , agrees . 
`` He has woven the Human Rights Act into the fabric of our legal system . 
He has a terrier-like tenacity , deeply-held convictions and the courage of a lion . 
He 's going to be extraordinarily difficult to replace . '' 
Born Cape Town , August 15 1932 Family Married Susan Leonore in 1977 , with whom he has a stepson and stepdaughter .

2005-10-21,"Friday 21 October 2005 15.24 BST A bill proposed by former cabinet minister Clare Short to force a vote in parliament before sending troops to war hit the parliamentary buffers today . 
Downing Street earlier said the legislation would have been impractical . 
After four hours of debate , the bill was `` talked out '' by Commons leader Geoff Hoon , meaning there will not be a vote on whether to refer it to the committee stage , the next step in a bill 's progress . 
This in effect means the bill now stands no chance of becoming law . 
The Liberal Democrat foreign affairs spokesman , Sir Menzies Campbell , said : `` Parliament missed a rare opportunity to assert its authority over the executive . 
`` To send British troops into battle is the ultimate responsibility and it should be one for members of parliament . '' 
Ms Short , who resigned shortly after the start of the Iraq war , today brought in a private member 's bill that would have curtailed the power of the prime minister to declare war without the backing of the House of Commons . 
Under the bill , both the Commons and the Lords would have had to be shown the case for war and its legal justification before voting on whether to give the go-ahead . 
But before MPs even finished debating the bill , No 10 said such a law could stop the government acting quickly and rob it of the crucial element of surprise . 
The prime minister 's official spokesman also made clear there had been a vote ahead of action in Iraq . 
`` As the prime minister and the foreign secretary have both said on the record in the past , what you do not want to do is put yourself in a position where , for some reason you ca n't foresee at the moment , action has to take place very quickly , '' he said . 
`` Therefore you may not want to commit yourself to a position where you rob yourself of the element of surprise and give the enemy advance notice . '' 
But in the chamber Ms Short insisted under her bill the PM would still have been allowed to take urgent action without approval but would be forced to pull the troops back if parliament then rejected the move . 
She said her move had the backing of a large number of MPs from all parties as well as the families of soldiers killed in the conflict . 
Ms Short said it was ridiculous that the power to wage war still officially lay with the monarchy as a royal prerogative - today exercised by the prime minister of the day . 
The MP for Birmingham Ladywood pointed out that even if a prime minister decided to allow parliament a vote - as Tony Blair did over Iraq - he was free to ignore its decision . 
Ms Short said her bill would have prevented the `` machinations and shenanigans '' over the withholding of the attorney general 's legal advice about the Iraq war . 
She suggested that the powers in the hands of the prime minister could be used to justify moves to `` exaggerate '' a threat . 
`` Given the powers he has , the prime minister could argue that he was entitled to secretly commit us to war in April 2002 by giving his word to president Bush as has now been revealed by the leaking of the Downing Street memo . 
`` Similarly he could insist that he was entitled to exaggerate the intelligence and the threat of WMD , manipulate the legal advice and misreport the French position on the possible use of their veto in the security council because if the power to make war belongs to him and requires no approval from parliament , then he was entitled to do what he thought was right and then set out to persuade , in the way he found best , the cabinet , parliament and country to support the decision he had already made . '' 
The bill 's sponsors included former Tory leader William Hague and Tory former chancellor Ken Clarke - although neither was in the chamber to hear the debate . 
Backing the bill , the Liberal Democrat David Heath said : `` It is our right as a parliament to disagree with the executive . 
`` If the executive can not command the support of the house then it has no business sending forces into conflict . '' 
Gordon Prentice , a Labor MP , claimed the chancellor , Gordon Brown , was in favor of the bill . 
The Tory MP Roger Gale also spoke up in favor of the bill , reminding MPs that the prime minister of the day was neither commander-in-chief nor head of state , as is the case with the US president . 
But the Tory former shadow defense minister James Gray - who opposed the Iraq war - said he did not support the bill because `` only popular wars will be waged '' rather than `` unpopular but necessary '' wars .

2005-10-22,"This age of fanaticism is no time for non-believers to make enemies Humanists need to be less fussy about working with the religious who share our commitment to social justice The old story of Voltaire on his death bed is surely familiar . 
A priest bursts in on him crying , `` Renounce the devil and all his works ! '' 
Voltaire affably replies , `` This is no time to make enemies . '' 
This time of terrorist and terror , real and imagined , is no time for non-believers to make enemies . 
Fundamentalism and fanaticism are rife , but are being rejected or resisted within their own religions by most Christians and Muslims . 
If we humanists are fully secure in our non-belief , scepticism and secularism , we can work together with those of all beliefs who fight against new or born-again enemies to freedom . 
We should not confuse the pinpricks of religiosity -LRB- religious broadcasting on the BBC -RRB- or the specific body blows of even the modern Catholic church with the real threats to democracy , freedom and international law now posed by both Christian and Muslim fundamentalists . 
Archbishop Rowan Williams began a recent lecture on `` Law , Power and Peace '' with the scornful irony : `` The Iraq war was fought for the sake of freedom and democracy , so we are incessantly told . 
And ... whatever else may have resulted from that ill-fated enterprise , the present situation is not exactly freedom and democracy . '' 
There was that huge , memorable anti-war demonstration , but also Rowan Williams speaking out in powerful and reasoned terms . 
I felt that he `` spoke for England '' then , just as Robin Cook spoke for real Labor . 
Part of the motivation of the religious who spoke against the war and the mad lack of foresight and preparation for pacification may indeed have been their religious beliefs ; but the substantive arguments were rational , prudential and moral in universal terms . 
Let me make a confession . 
An admirably troublemaking body called the Citizen Organising Foundation is strong in the East End of London . 
They campaign on issues of poverty , discrimination and empowerment . 
They are an inter-faith body - Christians of many denominations , Jews , Muslims and Hindus . 
I met them through a common concern with citizenship education . 
They stretched their ecumenicity by electing me , a vice-president of the British Humanist Association , as an honorary fellow at a ceremony at St Martin-in-the-Fields ; I risked a humanist blasphemy trial gladly , because all their practical actions were motivated by a morality of social justice . 
That is what they had in common . 
Oh yes , they speak , as do Rowan Williams and the Chief Rabbi , of morality needing a grounding in faith . 
But their real religious differences , if insisted on at every turn , would render impossible their common commitment to concrete objectives of justice and human rights . 
The great German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer , killed by the Gestapo , famously argued in his prison letters for a religionless form of Christianity appropriate for the new secular world . 
Such thinking was also that of Paul Tillich , and John Robinson 's book Honest to God was a pop version that so offended the pious tabloid editors . 
The phrase `` secular Christianity '' , current for a while among Protestant theologians , led not surprisingly to some confusion . 
The South African theologian and anti-apartheid activist John de Gruchy has revived the 16th-century usage of More and Erasmus to speak of `` Christian humanism '' . 
This is not merely a commitment to social justice among all of us , religious and irreligious alike , but recognition that , through shared natural reason , politics is a secular activity . 
For politics is inherently concerned with arbitration and compromise between differing values and interests , whereas the fundamentalist believes in a clear and literal truth in an ancient text and in a duty to impose truth on others . 
There are bizarre similarities of belief between the fundamentalists of Protestantism and Islam . 
They each believe we are in `` the last days '' and that Armageddon , the final victory or the `` Rapture '' is near at hand - so little need for the slow and tolerant processes of legal arbitration and political compromise . 
We humanists do not need to mute our intellectual criticism of religion , but for social and political purposes we should work with those who can be the most effective combatants against fanaticism . 
To work with those of other beliefs implies , of course , tact and courtesy to mute immediate criticism of what for the time and purpose at hand are irrelevancies . 
It is historically and psychologically foolish for secularists to believe that criticism of all religious belief is an effective way of combating violent fanaticism . 
We too can spend too much time preaching to the converted . 
And we do , up to a point , have a lot in common with most believers . 
Rowan Williams earlier this year talked to the Citizen Organising Foundation on `` Who 's Bringing Up Our Children ? '' 
`` What are the characteristics you would regard as marks of maturity , or having grown up as a human being ? 
... A human adult is someone who believes that change is possible in their own lives and the lives of those around them . 
A human adult is someone who ... knows they are not right about everything , and that they wo n't live for ever . 
An adult is someone sensitive to the cost of the choices they make for themselves and the people around them . 
An adult is someone who is not afraid of difference ... who is aware of being answerable to something more than a cultural consensus - someone whose values and priorities are shaped by something other than majority votes ; which is why I add -LRB- but you would expect me to -RRB- that an awareness of the Holy is an important aspect of being an adult . '' 
Well , we would expect him to , would n't we ? 
But his basic argument , like that of Bonhoeffer and John de Gruchy , is that political justice is a secular imperative . 
Our motivations may differ ; but surely we can respect differing motivations if they point to common action ? 
For Rowan Williams asked : `` What if we live in an environment where apathy and cynicism are the default positions for most people on issues of public concern ? 
... What if our environment is passive to the culture of the global market , simply receiving that constant stream of messages which flows out from producers and marketeers ? '' 
Those questions used to be answered with moral authority by Labor governments , but now there is only New Labor 's moral vacuum . 
Rowan Williams speaks with an impressive interrogating authority . 
Philosophically he is a pluralist who can quote both the churchman Neville Figgis and the Jewish atheist Harold Laski . 
Humanists must assert the secularity and plurality of politics and citizenship ; but in doing this we should not assume all believers differ from us . 
Christian humanists also believe politics is part of the secular sphere -LRB- the natural law , not the divine law -RRB- . 
Religious fanaticism thrives domestically where there is either physical poverty or poverty of political and social ideals , and internationally where there is gross injustice . 
Humanists need to be more active in social policies and less fussy about the company we keep .

2005-10-25,"The MP George Galloway angrily rejected fresh allegations last night from a US senate investigation that he lied under oath about Saddam Hussein 's multimillion-pound oil-for-food program . 
The inquiry , headed by the Republican Norm Coleman , claimed he had `` knowingly made false or misleading statements under oath '' when he appeared before a committee hearing in Washington in May . 
The MP for Bethnal Green and Bow won widespread acclaim , especially from anti-Iraq war campaigners , when he flew to the US capital to confront Mr Coleman . 
An assistant to Mr Galloway , Ron McKay , who sat beside him at the Senate hearing , said last night that the MP was prepared to fly to Washington again to face the new allegations . 
`` If such an allegation has been made , George denies it absolutely and is ready to fly to the US tomorrow if Coleman brings these charges and it will all be sorted in court , '' he said . 
Mr Galloway , who was forced out of the Labor party because of anti-war comments , and the senator have been at loggerheads since the Senate began its inquiry into oil-for-food , a UN humanitarian program intended to alleviate Iraqi suffering from sanctions . 
Saddam abused the program . 
The latest report from the committee claims : `` Galloway personally solicited and was granted oil allocations from the government of Iraq during the reign of Saddam Hussein . 
The Hussein regime granted Galloway and the Mariam Appeal -LRB- an organization he set up to help Iraqis suffering from sanctions -RRB- eight allocations totalling 23m barrels from 1999 through to 2003 . '' 
`` Galloway 's wife , Dr Amineh Abu-Zayyad , received approximately $ 150,000 in connection with one of those oil allocations . '' 
`` Galloway 's political campaign , the Mariam Appeal , received at least $ 446,000 in connection with the oil allocations granted to Galloway and the Mariam Appeal under the oil-for-food program . '' 
`` The Hussein regime received improper ` surcharge ' payments amounting to $ 1,642,000 in connection with the oil allocations granted to Galloway and the Mariam Appeal . '' 
`` Galloway knowingly made false or misleading statements under oath before the sub-committee . '' 
Mr Galloway said last night : `` There is not a shred of truth in any of these allegations . 
There has been no impropriety and I have not received even one thin dime from the oil-for-food program . '' 
Tariq Aziz , the former deputy prime minister who has been in jail since the US invasion of Iraq , allegedly told the investigation the oil had been allocated in the name of two of Mr Galloway 's agents , one of whom was Fawaz Zureikat . 
However , he added : `` These oil allocations were for the benefit of George Galloway and for Mariam 's Appeal . 
The proceeds from the sale benefited the cause and Mr Galloway . '' 
Mr Aziz is one of the primary witnesses mentioned in the new Senate investigation . 
It quotes him as authenticating a letter supposedly sent by the head of Iraqi intelligence detailing a meeting between Mr Galloway , Mr Zureikat and an unnamed intelligence officer during which the MP is said to have asked for an increased oil allocation . 
The letter was published in the Daily Telegraph in 2003 . 
Mr Galloway successfully sued the newspaper , which is currently appealing against the ruling . 
According to the new report , Mr Aziz `` stated that he recognized the ... letter and recalled seeing it in the past '' . 
Mr Aziz also allegedly told investigators that Mr Galloway had expressed concern to him about `` the appearance of taking money directly from the Iraqi government '' , and asked for his and his wife 's name to be omitted from official documents . 
However , the report found that several documents , authenticated by former regime officials , did mention Mr Galloway by name . 
The report quoted the former Iraqi vice-president Taha Yasin Ramadan saying Mr Galloway , who is now an MP for the Respect party , was a `` friend of Iraq '' who `` needed to be compensated for his support '' . 
`` Galloway needed money to pay for his actions , '' Mr Ramadan allegedly told investigators , adding `` we gave him oil to sell to make the money '' . 
According to the report , the claim was confirmed by the former minister of oil , Amer Rashid . 
Mr Galloway 's wife , Dr Abu Zayyad , from whom he is estranged , could not be contacted last night . 
But she is quoted in the report as denying having received any money . 
Mr McKay challenged the validity of the statements made by Mr Aziz and Mr Ramadan . 
`` Tariq Aziz has been in custody and we know from his lawyer this senate committee offered him a deal - just what I do not know , whether reduced charges or freedom - and it is ironic that Tariq Aziz , Yasin and Saddam are being accused , on the one hand , of being homicidal maniacs and on the other of being relied upon to give a true and accurate statements uncoerced .

2005-10-26,"Elaina Morton is not listed as one of the 2,000 Americans now confirmed killed in Iraq since the start of the war , but she might as well be . 
In US military parlance the 23-year-old lab technician from Kansas would have been referred to as a `` surviving spouse '' . 
But three months after her husband , Staff Sergeant Benjamin Morton , was killed by insurgents in Mosul , Elaina picked up a gun and shot herself . 
The fact that the military did not issue a press release to announce the death of the former college student who loved her cat , Stinky , and enjoyed hiking , photography and camping , does not make her any less a casualty of the war . 
Hers is thought to be the first confirmed case of a war widow committing suicide , and as the US toll in Iraq yesterday hit the grim 2,000 landmark her death is proof of the immeasurable emotional toll that the conflict has put on families of servicemen and women . 
George Bush yesterday spoke to wives of servicemen at Bollings air force base in Washington , as part of a strategy to confront the death toll head on by portraying the sacrifice in the Iraq war as the best way to keep terrorists from striking the US again . 
But for many bereaved families the bigger picture the president highlighted has been consumed by the day-to-day struggle of coping with their grief . 
Deedy Salie knows the feelings of isolation and desperation that Elaina Morton must have gone through before she took her life . 
Deedy 's husband , David , was killed on Valentine 's Day last year when his Humvee was blown up by an improvised explosive device in the restive city of Baquba , north-east of Baghdad . 
`` I was an army wife for nine years , and the army way is ` suck it up and drive on ' , '' she says . 
But no matter how hard she tried she could n't just suck it up , and she could n't just drive on . 
The pressures put on a family by a very public death , she says , are extreme . 
`` I do n't want to say that any death is normal , but my husband 's death was all over the television and in the papers , '' she says . 
`` People recognized my children in the store . 
It has been a rollercoaster . 
One day we all seem OK , but the next one of us just bottoms out . 
Everybody keeps saying it is going to get easier , but when that happens I 'll call and let you know , because it is actually getting harder and harder . '' 
Deedy says her daughter , Chyna , 12 , was so angry with her father for going to Iraq and getting killed that she has only just begun to grieve . 
Lucas , six , had nightmares about insurgents hiding in the flowerbeds . 
She does n't know what Hunter , three , is thinking . 
When the family was living near the army base , support groups were available . 
But Deedy , like Elaina Morton and countless other bereaved spouses , moved away to be closer to friends and family . 
And that was the last she heard from the army . 
`` I do n't expect the army to coddle me for the rest of my life , but at the same time we should not be thrown to the wind , '' she says . 
`` There should be somebody who calls , a professional who can pick up on things . 
I keep thinking about that poor girl who killed herself . 
Who is to say that if a grief counsellor had been calling her just once a month they would n't have picked up on those subtle little hints ? '' 
Deedy sought out grief counselling for herself and her family but , still a proud army wife , it took her months to do so . 
`` I do n't want this to be about being for or against the war , '' she tells the Guardian . 
`` My husband still has lots of friends and colleagues over there . 
But I do n't want what happened to that girl to happen to anyone else . '' 
Inge Colton is another widow who wishes she could escape Iraq , but every day when she turns on the television , listens to the radio , picks up a newspaper , it is right there in her face . 
`` It is not like he died of cancer or something , I see it every day and I am confronted with it every day . '' 
Her husband , Chief Warrant Officer Lawrence Colton , was killed on Easter Day last year when his Apache helicopter was shot down by a surface-to-air missile while responding to a distress call from a fuel convoy under attack . 
Inge had heard from a friend that an Apache from Fort Hood , Texas , had been downed in Baghdad , and when she opened the door of their home to find the uniformed men on the doorstep she knew instantly why they were there . 
`` But I still closed the door on them ; I did not want to hear what they were going to tell me . 
When they knocked again I just said , ` Can you give me a second ? ' '' 
For Inge , 41 , life will never be the same . 
`` Our country wants you to move on , but that is impossible because I live with it every day of my life . 
I get up in the morning and I put on makeup and make myself presentable , and people think I am getting back to normal . 
But it 's a different kind of normal . 
I still cry every day . '' 
According to Karen Spears Zacharias , who has set up a grassroots network linked to the website heromama.org for widows and the 1,200 children who have lost parents in Iraq , there is better support from the military than there was during the Vietnam era , when her father was killed . 
But too many widows unable or unwilling to ask for help are falling through the cracks . 
`` What 23-year-old girl is going to feel comfortable walking into a veterans center or military hospital for counselling ? 
That 's like telling someone who lives 10 miles outside of town and who does n't own a car that there 's milk at the store - if they just go get it . 
`` People have said that suicide was Elaina 's choice and we should respect that . 
But I do n't buy that . 
When you 're 23 years old and commit suicide it is not about choice but about being in an unhealthy place . 
We have a responsibility to go beyond just saying that we will be there for them and really be there for them . '' 
She adds : `` No one wants to talk about suicide because there is a feeling that we failed that person . 
But we need to talk about it , we ca n't wait to have 10 more widows kill themselves before we address it . 
Because right now it does n't feel like we are anywhere near the end of this war . ''

2005-10-27,"Abu Theeb is the leader of a band of Sunni insurgents that preys on US targets north of Baghdad . 
Last week he openly defied al-Qaida in Iraq by actively supporting the referendum . 
Ghaith Abdul-Ahad spent five days with him - and uncovered evidence of a growing split in the insurgency Abu Theeb is a tall , handsome , well-built man with a thin beard and thick eyebrows . 
His name is a nom de guerre : it means Father of the Wolf . 
He is a farmer during daylight and a commander of a mujahideen cell , a group of holy warriors , at night . 
He and his men roam the farmland north of Baghdad in search of prey - a US armored Humvee , perhaps , or an Iraqi army unit . 
On the eve of last week 's constitutional referendum , Abu Theeb , the leader of a group of Sunni insurgents , was to be found in the middle of a schoolyard in a village north of Baghdad . 
The school was to be a polling center the next day . 
He stood flanked by 10 bearded fighters in white robes and chequered headscarves . 
There were a few posters on the walls , and plastic ribbons marking out lanes where voters would queue , but other than Abu Theeb and his men , the building was deserted . 
The security guards hired by the referendum committee in Baghdad had failed to show up - not all that surprising an event in one of the most dangerous areas in Iraq . 
The local tribe , ie Abu Theeb and co , are notorious for kidnappings and executions . 
Abu Theeb looked around him , a commander inspecting the field before battle . 
He moved with his men around the school , inspecting the adjacent streets and the back gate , looking for weak points , looking for easy access for a car bomb or an armed onslaught . 
The school guard sheepishly followed the entourage around , a Kalashnikov on one shoulder . 
At one point , Abu Theeb grabbed a piece of paper and drew a sketch of the school , marking out where his men should be posted the next day . 
He turned to a short , chubby ginger-haired guy in his 30s with a big jihadi beard . 
`` You will be the commander tomorrow , '' he said . 
`` Distribute some of our weapons to the men . '' 
The stakes were high for Abu Theeb and his men . 
Al-Qaida forces in Iraq - forces that are , at least on paper , allies of the Sunni insurgents - had vowed to kill anyone who took part in the referendum . 
But in the Sunni areas of Iraq , the people and the local Iraqi insurgents among them had a different view : they were eager to vote . 
There was a widespread sense of regret about the boycotting of the last elections , which left the parliament in Baghdad dominated by Shia and Kurdish parties - and left the Sunnis , who held the power in Saddam 's Iraq , out in the cold . 
The Sunnis wanted to take part in last week 's referendum ; they wanted a `` no '' vote on the draft constitution . 
This left Abu Theeb , a man who has devoted himself and his resources to fighting the Americans , in a curious position . 
His battle on polling day would be to secure a safe and smooth voting for his people - in a referendum organised by the enemy . 
In doing so he would be going up against the al-Qaida forces , and risking a split in the insurgency in Iraq . 
I spent five days with Abu Theeb and his people last week , and I witnessed a very curious thing : a bunch of mujahideens talking politics and urging restraint . 
`` Politics for us is like filthy dead meat , '' Abu Theeb told me . 
`` We are not allowed to eat it , but if you are passing through the desert and your life depends on it , God says it 's OK . '' 
This is a profound shift in thinking for these insurgents , a shift that might just change the way things develop in Iraq . 
While we were at the school , Abu Theeb pulled one of his young men aside and rebuked him for an IED - improvised explosive device - bombing the night before : `` I thought we agreed that nothing will happen for the next few days . '' 
The short young man mumbled that it was n't his group - someone else must have done it . 
Abu Theeb 's village , where the polling station was based , is a small hamlet that lies on the banks of the Tigris river north of Baghdad . 
A serpent-like road passes through the village . 
The palm groves on either side of the road are pockmarked by bomb craters . 
A couple of thousand Sunni Arabs from one tribe live here . 
Everyone is related ; they say they can trace their history back to the prophet Muhammad . 
Women are rarely seen in public and almost everyone is a fundamentalist Salafi Muslim . 
The men sport big bushy beards and wear ankle-length dishdashas -LRB- robes -RRB- . 
Mosques are scattered everywhere and at prayer time the place grinds to a halt . 
There are two ways into the village . 
The official way in takes you through a 100m-long checkpoint of blast walls , concrete barriers and barbed wire . 
It is manned by masked Shia Iraqi soldiers from the south of the country and commanded by US soldiers . 
Cars and cards are checked regularly and the roads are closed down , forcing people to drive for hours through the farmlands around the village before hitting the main road again . 
Driving in and out through this checkpoint reminds one of a second world war movie of an eastern European town under German occupation . 
The locals call the checkpoint the Rafah crossing , in reference to the notorious checkpoint in Gaza . 
Then there is the unofficial way in . 
A narrow , bumpy farm road provides the mujahideens with safe access into the village away from the weary eyes of the Iraqi soldiers . 
This is the road Abu Theeb took in last week . 
I went with him on condition that I did nothing to reveal his identity or the location of the village . 
For the purposes of the assignment , I was advised to pray , fast and dress like the men of the village , although I am not religious . 
Abu Theeb was born in this village four decades ago . 
He was one of five brothers and several sisters and his father was an illiterate farmer who went everywhere with his short-wave radio and loved to talk politics . 
In the 80s , Abu Theeb 's eldest brother was killed fighting in the Iran-Iraq war . 
Abu Theeb studied law at university in Baghdad before joining the Institute of National Security , an elite academy reserved mostly for Sunni Arabs . 
It was the graduates of this academy who were used to staff Saddam 's secret services ; Abu Theeb was a loyal citizen , and he went on to a job in the security services . 
But his nationalism evaporated after Saddam 's invasion of Kuwait . 
`` I hated the government , '' he says . 
`` I realized that all that they were telling us about the nation and the leader was false . 
They had no pride , no honor . 
I wanted to leave , to take a long break , so I left the service to do religious studies . '' 
He joined an Islamic Sharia school to train as a cleric . 
There he fell in love with two subjects : the teachings of Ibn Taimia , the father of the fundamentalist Salafi school of thinking , and religious politics . 
Later , however , he was obliged to return to his old job at the Amn al-Aam , the General Security , one of Saddam 's feared security apparatuses , and there he stayed until the American occupation toppled the regime . 
`` When the fall happened , I went to a cleric I knew who was preaching jihad and asked him for weapons , '' he says . 
`` I was weeping . 
He said , ` Go away , things are too dangerous . ' 
I roamed the streets with a dagger in my pocket . 
I was too ashamed to come back home and see my family while Baghdad was under the occupation , dead bodies and bullet shells everywhere . '' 
He finally met up with a group of Syrian volunteers in Baghdad . 
They , like him , were looking for a fight with the Americans . 
He brought them back to his home , he says , and formed one of the first jihadi cells . 
They got to work . 
`` When the infidel conquers your home , it 's like seeing your women raped in front of your eyes and like your religion being insulted every day , '' says Abu Theeb . 
He joined others and started first with direct rocket-propelled grenade hits and small arms attacks on US convoys around his area , until a fellow Salafi fighter taught him how to set an IED using primitive techniques , a TV remote control and some artillery shells . 
A visiting Iraqi army general laid the ground rules for the group : IEDs were the most successful weapon , but should always be laid at least two kilometres outside the village to spare the people the wrath of the Americans . 
`` Everyone was fighting , men who under Saddam spent years as military deserters became zealous fighters , '' says Abu Theeb . 
`` Something like fire was inside us . 
We would go out to fight for days , leaving our families and wives behind . '' 
He and other Salafi fighters became known as the Anger Brigade , an insurgent group that has claimed responsibility for numerous attacks on US and Iraqi targets and is involved in kidnapping those who are perceived as collaborating with the much-hated occupation . 
This is truly a holy war for Abu Theeb . 
He tells me how once he was driving to Baghdad carrying a sack filled with anti-tank rocket heads for an operation in Baghdad . 
He was stopped at a checkpoint and American soldiers ordered him to step out and begun a car search . 
`` I prayed to God , '' he says . 
`` I told him , ` God , if I am doing what I am doing for your sake then spare me this . 
If it 's not , let them get me . ' 
The American soldier opened the boot where I had the sack filled with rocket heads . 
He moved it aside and started to search . 
When he finished and asked me to leave , I knew then I was blessed by God . '' 
God has not been so merciful with the rest of his family . 
One of his brothers and a nephew have died fighting the Americans ; another brother was killed a month ago as he was setting an IED on the side of the road . 
But Abu Theeb 's faith remains strong . 
For more than two years , Abu Theeb had been taking part in insurgent attacks on US and Iraqi targets , laying IEDs , carrying out ambushes and kidnappings . 
Then , about eight months ago , a group of Syrian men visited him . 
They identified themselves as part of the al-Qaida group in Iraq , and they asked for his cooperation in establishing a foothold for their organization in his area . 
`` They told me that they had support and money and wanted to open a new front here , '' says Abu Theeb . 
`` I said to them , ` What about the village - do you want this to become a new Fallujah ? ' '' 
Abu Theeb did n't want al-Qaida , even if their aims were ostensibly the same . 
`` When al-Qaida came here I was the first to fight it , '' he says . 
`` They went to the clerics and said , ` Denounce this man . 
If not , your blood will be spilled . ' 
They can kill and slaughter easily . '' 
Abu Theeb and other Salafi clerics and leaders of the insurgency north and south of Baghdad are now talking about a rift - a split between Iraqi Islamist and nationalistic insurgent groups , and the mainly foreign led and supported al-Qaida forces . 
They say that al-Qaida initially gained support among the Sunnis because of its ferocity and meticulous planning , and because it had money pouring in from jihadis all over the Arab world . 
Made up mostly of foreign Arabs , it quickly became the most feared insurgent group in Iraq , claiming responsibility for the bloodiest attacks against not only US and Iraqi forces but also civilians . 
`` If it was n't al-Qaida fighting with the Sunnis in Iraq the whole battle would have had a different outcome , '' says Abu Hafsa , another mujahideen commander based north of Baghdad . 
Abu Qutada , a mujahideen leader based in south Baghdad , agrees . 
`` Lots of the mujahideen groups are in need of money and weapons so they join the umbrella of al-Qaida for support , '' he says . 
But he adds : `` They differ with them in ideology . '' 
The tipping point came when al-Qaida , known then as the Tawhid al-Jihad , decided to target the Iraqi police and army and other Iraqi ministries and institutions . 
Its goal was to prevent the Americans establishing an Iraqi state that could lead the fight against the insurgency - and allow the Americans to take a back seat . 
`` They have experience in fighting and they did very clever stuff , '' says Abu Theeb . 
`` They attacked all the centres of the Iraqi state and prevented the Americans from creating a puppet state that they could hand everything to . 
The Iraqi resistance was occupied by fighting the Americans and could n't see that strategic goal . '' 
Perhaps inevitably , though , the insurgents turned out not to have the same stomach for Iraqi blood . 
`` Al-Qaida believes that anyone who does n't follow the Qur ` an literally is a Kaffir - apostate - and should be killed , '' says Abu Theeb . 
`` This is wrong . '' 
Al-Qaida marked down not only those who cooperated with the American occupation , but everyone who worked with the Iraqi government , police or army , as Kaffirs . 
Then they said that the entire Shia community were Kaffirs . 
For Sunnis like Abu Theeb , this was a step too far . 
The second serious stumbling block has been al-Qaida 's call for the establishment of an Islamic state -LRB- caliphate -RRB- based on the Taliban model in Afghanistan . 
This has already started taking place in towns and villages where al-Qaida is dominant . 
`` The resistance now is made up of nationalist and religious elements , '' says Abu Theeb . 
`` By calling for a caliphate you will alienate not only the resistance but the support we get from Syria and the gulf countries . '' 
The last thing these countries want is a Taliban state as a neighbor . 
Al-Qaida 's policies have drawn a furious response from the Iraqi security forces and the Shia militias , and it is Sunnis who have suffered . 
Scores have been executed after being kidnapped by paramilitary units . 
In Abu Theeb 's area alone , more than 300 Sunni families have taken refuge after fleeing Shia areas in Baghdad . 
`` Every time al-Qaida attacks a Shia mosque we are making all the Shias our enemies , '' he says . 
`` We are cementing them against us . '' 
Later he says : `` We have lost more men to the Shias than we have lost to the Americans . '' 
This rift in the insurgency has already gone far beyond angry words . 
Clashes erupted between al-Qaida fighters and Iraqi mujahideen cells after al-Qaida killed a group of Iraqi insurgents who they claimed were spying for the Americans . 
Back in the village , politics has become a hot issue . 
Everywhere - in the mosques after prayers , at weddings , in the main market and in private mujahideen circles - the talk is of politics . 
Abu Theeb says his move into politics has come at a price : he has had to shave off his beard so that he can visit Baghdad . 
For weeks he has been traveling , visiting houses , urging people to register to vote . 
`` It 's a new jihad , '' he says . 
`` There is time for fighting and a time for politics . '' 
I went back to the school with Abu Theeb on polling day . 
There was a festival atmosphere . 
Two of his guards were already at their positions , but the rest were more relaxed - their weapons lay against the wall and on tables . 
`` No one will attack , '' said Abu Theeb . 
Inside the classroom that had become the polling station , an old sheik sat on a wooden bench . 
`` The judge and the monitors did n't come from Baghdad - they said this is a hot area - so the sheik of the village is going be the monitor , '' said Abu Theeb . 
People began to trickle in . 
The officials present soon decided that it was not realistic to expect the women to come in , so each man who came in with an ID card was given a whole stack of ballot papers . 
`` Nine papers to Haji Abu Hussein , '' shouted a registration official . 
Another official sitting on another table handed Haji Abu Hussein the nine ballots . 
The man took his ballots , but instead of voting in private in the ballot box , he publicly ticked the `` no '' boxes , folded the papers , and then chucked them in the box . 
By midday people had stopped coming and the officials started ticking the boxes on ballot papers themselves . 
The next day , America and the authorities were crowing about how well the referendum had gone ; yesterday - after a `` yes '' vote had been returned - leading Sunni politicians accused the Shia in the south of stuffing ballot boxes . 
Well , some of the Sunnis in the north are certainly guilty of it . 
Two days after the balloting , Abu Theeb and two other clerics sat on the floor of a mosque debating the political future of their group and the Sunnis in general . 
`` We should keep all the options open , '' Abu Theeb told them . 
Even a coalition with the enemy .

2005-11-01,"Relatives of some of those who died in the July 7 suicide bombings are expected to boycott today 's multi-faith service of remembrance at St Paul 's Cathedral . 
Families of a handful of the 52 men and women who died are understood to be planning to stay away because they feel overwhelmed by anger . 
Some are bitter about what they say is a failure of support from the government in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks . 
Others blame Tony Blair 's decision to go to war in Iraq for making London more vulnerable to suicide bombings . 
Sean Cassidy , whose son , Ciaran , 24 , was killed in the Russell Square bomb , said he would attend the service today with his wife , Veronica , and daughter , Lisa , because he hoped to be able to speak to Mr Blair to express his anger . 
`` As far as I am concerned there would be no memorial service if it was n't for the war in Iraq , '' he said . 
`` I never thought of not going because I want to speak to Mr Blair to have a little chat about the war . 
I am not sure what the protocol will be but I would like to speak to him . 
Everyone knows the war made us more vulnerable to attack , but Mr Blair wo n't say it . 
There are some families who say they are n't going because they are angry at the lack of support from the government . 
I am still very angry , it just does n't go away , it just comes to you every couple of hours . 
You just ca n't get away from it . '' 
Many relatives have communicated their feelings over a special secure website set up for families to share their experiences . 
Issues around the government 's much-criticised compensation scheme , the war in Iraq and the feeling that not enough practical support has been provided by ministers have been discussed on the site . 
For the 2,300 strong congregation expected today , however , the focus will be on healing . 
`` I think they have done the honorable thing by holding a proper memorial like this , '' said Graham Russell , whose son Philip , 29 , died in the Tavistock Square bus bombing . 
`` I hope they do those that died proud and I suspect they will . '' 
Most of the relatives will attend today 's service , with some traveling from as far afield as New Zealand , Australia and Bangladesh . 
Conducted by the Dean of St Paul 's , the Very Reverend John Moses and attended by Mr Blair , the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh , the 55-minute service is designed to reflect the religious and cultural diversity of London and those who died or were injured . 
Of the 52 people who were killed , 36 were British citizens and families of the other 16 , who came from countries as diverse as Mauritania , Ireland , Italy , Nigeria , Grenada , Poland , France , New Zealand , Ghana and Bangladesh , have flown into London to be at the service today . 
In an opening bidding , the dean will speak of the resolve of countless men and women of different faiths and cultures to live together in peace . 
Four candles , representing each of the locations where the suicide bombers struck - Aldgate , Edgware Road , King 's Cross and Tavistock Square - will form the focal point of the service as they are carried to the Dome altar by emergency and transport staff . 
They will be followed by bereaved families of individuals who died in the three tube attacks and the bomb on the No 30 bus . 
The driver of the bus , George Psaradakis , had been due to carry the Tavistock Square candle but he is suffering severe post-traumatic stress and understood to be too ill to attend . 
After meetings with the culture secretary , Tessa Jowell , last week several families were asked if they would like to meet the Queen following the service . 
It was an invitation which divided one family . 
Louise Gray , whose husband Richard , 41 , was killed in the Aldgate blast , told the London Evening Standard that her son Adam , 11 , was refusing to go to the service but his sister , Ruby , seven , would be presenting a posy to the Queen . 
Mrs Gray said Adam blamed Mr Blair for making London vulnerable to the terrorist attack which killed his father as he traveled to work from his home in Ipswich . 
`` He -LRB- Adam -RRB- is very angry . 
He fully understands what happened . 
He is very angry with the bombers but he also blames the war and he blames the government . 
He does n't want to be part of anything that has Tony Blair there . '' 
But she said Ruby decided to come after being asked by the organisers to present a posy to the Queen . 
Other families who will meet the Queen include Graham and Janet Foulkes , the parents of David Foulkes , 22 , a Guardian employee and one of the youngest to die in the bombings . 
-LRB- The service begins at 3pm -RRB- Processional hymn Praise to the Lord , the Almighty , the King of Creation The bidding given by the Dean of St Paul 's , Dr John Moses , followed by The Lord 's Prayer Anthem O Vos Omnes qui Transitis per viam -LRB- All ye that pass by behold -RRB- Reading Isaiah 51.1-6 , read by Ken Livingstone , the mayor of London Hymn Judge Eternal , Throned in Splendour Sermon given by the Archbishop of Canterbury , Dr Rowan Williams Hymn Father Hear The Prayer We Offer In remembrance and thanksgiving led by Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor , Archbishop of Westminster , and the Rev Esme Beswick , co-president of Churches Together in England Kyrie Eleison by Maurice Durufl , sung by the choir .

2005-11-04,"Case will delve deeply into argument for Iraq war Vice president likely to be called as witness Lewis `` Scooter '' Libby , the vice presidential adviser who helped build the US case for the Iraq war , stood before a judge yesterday , then had his fingerprints and mugshot taken as a long-simmering intelligence leak scandal arrived in court . 
Mr Libby pleaded not guilty to five counts in total , including lying to a grand jury , making false statements to federal investigators , and obstruction of justice . 
Later his lawyers vowed he would not strike a plea deal but would fight to clear his name . 
However , the appearance in court of a top neo-conservative who only a few days ago was one of the most powerful men in the White House marked an ominous milestone for the embattled Bush administration . 
Mr Libby was the first White House official to be indicted while in office since Orville Babcock , President Ulysses Grant 's secretary , who was charged 130 years ago for a whisky tax scam . 
High-placed miscreants since then , including the Watergate defendants , have chosen to resign before being charged . 
Mr Libby stuck to his post as vice president Dick Cheney 's chief of staff until last week 's indictment , for lying about his role in the 2003 outing of a CIA agent , Valerie Plame , the wife of a critic of the Iraq war . 
Yesterday , he stood in the same spot in the same Washington courtroom as Colonel Oliver North , the central figure in the Iran-Contra scandal that overshadowed the last years of the Reagan administration . 
This affair is threatening to take as great a toll on the Bush White House . 
Karl Rove , President Bush 's closest adviser , is still under active investigation by the special prosecutor in the case , Patrick Fitzgerald , and there were signs yesterday that the strain was beginning to show . 
`` Top White House aides '' quoted in the Washington Post said Mr Rove 's future was being privately discussed , and argued he may have become too heavy a burden on an already distracted administration . 
Mr Cheney is almost certain to be a witness in Mr Libby 's case and could be in legal jeopardy himself if he turns out to be one of the unnamed officials mentioned in the indictment who discussed Ms Plame on Air Force Two in June 2003 . 
The case will also delve deeply into the building of the White House case for war in Iraq , based largely on alleged weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist . 
It was an argument Mr Libby , a former lawyer himself , took a lead role in assembling on his boss 's behalf . 
The sensitivity of the coming trial was clear in yesterday 's proceedings as lawyers discussed the declassifying of thousands of documents and seeking security clearance for defense lawyers to hear secret evidence , which will take up to six weeks . 
The next hearing will not be until February 3 . 
In a sign of its nervousness the White House has issued a memo to its staff ordering them not to communicate with Mr Libby . 
He limped into court on crutches -LRB- having broken his foot running up stairs at home -RRB- accompanied only by his lawyers and his wife , Harriet . 
She slipped her hand round his waist and gave him an encouraging pat on the backside before the hearing began . 
When his turn to answer to the charges came , Mr Libby levered himself up , set his crutches against the court lectern at the center of the wood panel and marble court , and said : `` With respect , your honor , I plead not guilty . '' 
It was all over in minutes . 
He was released without bail , `` under his own cognisance '' , and left his legal team and his wife waiting in a corridor while he was photographed and fingerprinted in the marshal 's office in the basement . 
The entourage then walked out into a pack of journalists and television cameras waiting at a side entrance , where Mr Libby 's newly hired defense lawyer , Ted Wells , a frequent player in past administration scandals , voiced the fallen official 's defiance . 
`` Mr Libby has pleaded not guilty to each and every count in the indictment , '' Mr Wells said . 
`` In pleading not guilty he has declared to the world that he is innocent . 
He has declared he intends to fight the charges in the indictment , and he has declared that he wants to clear his good name , and he wants a jury trial . '' 
The Libbys were bundled into a black limousine , and began the long wait for the trial . 
It is not clear what Mr Libby plans to do now . 
He once voiced a longing to get away from it all in Crete to drink `` odd-named wines '' and pursue his other vocation as a novelist . 
He published an exotic and erotic tale called The Apprentice , set in Japan a century ago and featuring young girls being raped by bears .

2005-11-07,"Blair 's litany of failures on Iraq - ambassador 's damning verdict Meyer says PM failed to exert any leverage on Bush and was seduced by US power President Bush with Tony Blair in the Blue Room at the White House a few hours before addressing Congress and the nation on September 20 2001 . 
Sir Christopher , highly critical of Mr Blair 's performance in the run-up to the war , argues the prime minister and his team were `` seduced '' by the proximity and glamour of US power and reluctant to negotiate conditions with George Bush for Britain 's support for the war . 
He says Mr Blair failed to exploit his enormous leverage with Mr Bush not only to secure a precious delay but to plan for postwar Iraq . 
`` We may have been the junior partner in the enterprise but the ace up our sleeve was that America did not want to go it alone . 
Had Britain so insisted , Iraq after Saddam might have avoided the violence that may yet prove fatal to the entire enterprise . '' 
But Mr Blair did not have any appetite for bargaining with Mr Bush , according to Sir Christopher : `` Tony Blair chose to take his stand against Saddam and alongside President Bush from the highest of high moral ground . 
It is the definitive riposte to Blair the Poodle , seduced though he and his team always appeared to be by the proximity and glamour of American power . 
`` But the high moral ground , and the pure white flame of unconditional support to an ally in service of an idea , have their disadvantages . 
They place your destiny in the hands of an ally . 
They fly above the tangled history of Sunni , Shia , Kurd , Turkomen and Assyrian . 
They discourage descent into the dull detail of tough and necessary bargaining : meat and drink to Margaret Thatcher but , so it seemed , uncongenial to Tony Blair . '' 
The former diplomat accuses Mr Blair of weakness in failing to engage Mr Bush in the `` plain-speaking conversation '' that needed to take place . 
`` Had Blair told Bush in clear and explicit terms that he would be unable to support a war unless British wishes were met ? 
I doubted it . '' 
The Washington embassy repeatedly advised Downing Street to use its leverage , but was ignored . 
Delaying the invasion from March to the autumn would have allowed the United Nations weapons inspectors extra months to establish whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction , enabled the US and Britain to reach an understanding with France and Russia , two of the biggest sceptics about war , and increased international support , instead of going to war `` in the company of a motley ad hoc coalition of allies '' . 
The former diplomat , who enjoyed unparalleled access to all the key members of Mr Bush 's administration and supported the war , provides the most detailed account yet of the thinking inside the White House and Downing Street in the 18 months running up to the invasion in March 2003 . 
He says of the war now : `` History 's verdict looks likely to be that it was terminally flawed both in conception and execution . '' 
Publication comes at a time when Mr Blair is vulnerable domestically , and the indictment of Lewis `` Scooter '' Libby , the chief of staff of Vice-President Dick Cheney , has reopened the debate in the US about why the country went to war . 
Sir Christopher records a conversation with Mr Libby who told him `` we were the only ally that mattered . 
That was a powerful lever '' . 
But the former ambassador says London `` was not fertile ground for the notion of leverage or the tough negotiating position that must sometimes be taken even with the closest allies - as Churchill did with Roosevelt and Thatcher did with Reagan '' . 
He regrets that at precisely the moment that Mr Blair should have been bargaining , in the early autumn of 2002 , `` political energy in London had become consumed by a titanic struggle to keep public opinion , parliament and the Labor party onside for war . 
There was little energy left in No 10 to think about the aftermath . 
Since Downing Street drove Iraq policy , efforts made by the Foreign Office to engage with the Americans on the subject came to nothing . '' 
He questions whether No 10 relied too heavily on British military and intelligence advisers fatalistic about the inevitability of war and `` as a consequence underestimated its political leverage and ability to affect the course of events '' . 
He takes a swipe at John Scarlett , chairman of the joint intelligence committee , which was responsible for assessing intelligence , and one of the main authors of the controversial British dossier making a case against Saddam . 
Sir Christopher , who at one time was lined up to be head of the JIC , said he understood why Alastair Campbell , Mr Blair 's press secretary , wanted as categorical a public depiction of Saddam 's threat as possible . 
`` Equally , I would have expected the JIC to be rigorous in telling me how far I could go . '' 
One of Sir Christopher 's main charges is that Mr Blair failed to puncture the US administration 's belief that it would be `` sweetness and light in Iraq '' after the war , and the descent of Iraq into chaos today is , in part , a result of this . 
Sir Christopher recounts how Mr Bush told the inner circle at a US-British summit at Camp David in 2002 that the prime minister had `` cojones '' -LRB- balls -RRB- . 
The former ambassador says Britain should have taken advantage of such praise , making its participation in the war dependent on a fully worked-out plan for postwar Iraq , which he describes as `` defective '' and `` rudimentary '' . 
`` This would have been the appropriate quid pro quo for Blair 's display of cojones at this Camp David meeting with Bush . '' 
He is adamant Mr Bush was amenable to pressure almost to the end . 
`` Indeed , if it all went wrong at the UN , and the US was faced with going to war alone , it seemed to me that Bush might blink . 
Or , to put it another way : what Britain decided to do could be the decisive factor in the White House . '' 
The former ambassador says a delay from March to autumn 2003 could have made a significant difference : `` Even if the most optimistic predictions are finally realized for Iraq , the question will still be asked : why did the Americans and British make it so hard for themselves and even harder for Iraqis ? 
The US and the UK would have stood a better chance of going to war in good order , and of doing the aftermath right , had they planned on an autumn , not a spring , campaign . '' 
He reveals that Karl Rove , the political adviser to the president , told him there would have been no problem for Mr Bush in waiting until the end of 2003 or even early 2004 and this would not have risked entanglement in the US presidential campaign .

2005-11-08,"The media are minimizing US and British war crimes in Iraq The reporting of the Iraqi death toll - both in its scale and account of who is doing the killing - is profoundly dishonest We were told that the Iraqis do n't count . 
Before the invasion began , the head of US central command , General Thomas Franks , boasted that `` we do n't do body counts '' . 
His claim was repeated by Donald Rumsfeld in November 2003 -LRB- `` We do n't do body counts on other people '' -RRB- and the Pentagon last January -LRB- `` The only thing we keep track of is casualties for US troops and civilians '' -RRB- . 
But it 's not true . 
Almost every week the Pentagon claims to have killed 50 or 70 or 100 insurgents in its latest assault on the latest stronghold of the ubiquitous monster Zarqawi . 
In May the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said that his soldiers had killed 250 of Zarqawi 's `` closest lieutenants '' -LRB- or so 500 of his best friends had told him -RRB- . 
But last week , the Pentagon did something new . 
Buried in its latest security report to Congress is a bar chart labeled `` average daily casualties - Iraqi and coalition . 
1 Jan 04-16 Sep 05 '' . 
The claim that it kept no track of Iraqi deaths was false . 
The report does not explain what it means by casualty , or if its figures represent all casualties , only insurgents , or , as the foregoing paragraph appears to hint , only civilians killed by insurgents . 
There is no explanation of how the figures were gathered or compiled . 
The only accompanying text consists of the words `` Source : MNC-I '' , which means Multi-National Corps - Iraq . 
We 'll just have to trust them . 
What the chart shows is that these unexplained casualties have more than doubled since the beginning of the Pentagon 's survey . 
From January to March 2004 , 26 units of something or other were happening every day , while in September 2005 the something or other rose to 64 . 
But whatever it is that 's been rising , the weird morality of this war dictates that it is reported as good news . 
Journalists have been multiplying the daily average of mystery units by the number of days , discovering that the figure is lower than previous estimates of Iraqi deaths , and using it to cast doubts on them . 
As ever , the study in the line of fire is the report published by the Lancet in October last year . 
It was a household survey - of 988 homes in 33 randomly selected districts - and it suggested , on the basis of the mortality those households reported before and after the invasion , that the risk of death in Iraq had risen by a factor of 1.5 ; somewhere between 8,000 and 194,000 extra people had died , with the most probable figure being 98,000 . 
Around half the deaths , if Falluja was included , or 15 % if it was not , were caused by violence , and the majority of those by attacks on the part of US forces . 
In the US and the UK , the study was either ignored or torn to bits . 
The media described it as `` inflated '' , `` overstated '' , `` politicised '' and `` out of proportion '' . 
Just about every possible misunderstanding and distortion of its statistics was published , of which the most remarkable was the Observer 's claim that : `` The report 's authors admit it drew heavily on the rebel stronghold of Falluja , which has been plagued by fierce fighting . 
Strip out Falluja , as the study itself acknowledged , and the mortality rate is reduced dramatically . '' 
In fact , as they made clear on page one , the authors had stripped out Falluja ; their estimate of 98,000 deaths would otherwise have been much higher . 
But the attacks in the press succeeded in sinking the study . 
Now , whenever a newspaper or broadcaster produces an estimate of civilian deaths , the Lancet report is passed over in favor of lesser figures . 
For the past three months , the editors and subscribers of the website Medialens have been writing to papers and broadcasters to try to find out why . 
The standard response , exemplified by a letter from the BBC 's online news service last week , is that the study 's `` technique of sampling and extrapolating from samples has been criticised '' . 
That 's true , and by the same reasoning we could dismiss the fact that 6 million people were killed in the Holocaust , on the grounds that this figure has also been criticised , albeit by skinheads . 
The issue is not whether the study has been criticised , but whether the criticism is valid . 
As Medialens has pointed out , it was the same lead author , using the same techniques , who reported that 1.7 million people had died as a result of conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo -LRB- DRC -RRB- . 
That finding has been cited by Tony Blair , Colin Powell and almost every major newspaper on both sides of the Atlantic , and none has challenged either the method or the result . 
Using the Congo study as justification , the UN security council called for all foreign armies to leave the DRC and doubled the country 's UN aid budget . 
The other reason the press gives for burying the Lancet study is that it is out of line with competing estimates . 
Like Jack Straw , wriggling his way around the figures in a written ministerial statement , they compare it to the statistics compiled by the Iraqi health ministry and the website Iraq Body Count . 
In December 2003 , Associated Press reported that `` Iraq 's health ministry has ordered a halt to a count of civilians killed during the war '' . 
According to the head of the ministry 's statistics department , both the puppet government and the Coalition Provisional Authority demanded that it be stopped . 
As Naomi Klein has shown on these pages , when US soldiers stormed Falluja -LRB- a year ago today -RRB- , their first action was to seize the general hospital and arrest the doctors . 
The New York Times reported that `` the hospital was selected as an early target because the American military believed that it was the source of rumors about heavy casualties '' . 
After the coalition had used these novel statistical methods to improve the results , Blair told parliament that `` figures from the Iraqi ministry of health , which are a survey from the hospitals there , are in our view the most accurate survey there is '' . 
Iraq Body Count , whose tally has reached 26,000-30 ,000 , measures only civilian deaths which can be unambiguously attributed to the invasion and which have been reported by two independent news agencies . 
As the compilers point out , `` it is likely that many if not most civilian casualties will go unreported by the media ... our own total is certain to be an underestimate of the true position , because of gaps in reporting or recording '' . 
Of the seven mortality reports surveyed by the Overseas Development Institute , the estimate in the Lancet 's paper was only the third highest . 
It remains the most thorough study published so far . 
Extraordinary as its numbers seem , they are the most likely to be true . 
And what of the idea that most of the violent deaths in Iraq are caused by coalition troops ? 
Well according to the Houston Chronicle , even Blair 's favorite data source , the Iraqi health ministry , reports that twice as many Iraqis - and most of them civilians - are being killed by US and UK forces as by insurgents . 
When the Pentagon claims that it has just killed 50 or 70 or 100 rebel fighters , we have no means of knowing who those people really were . 
Everyone it blows to pieces becomes a terrorist . 
In July Jack Keane , the former vice chief of staff of the US army , claimed that coalition troops had killed or captured more than 50,000 `` insurgents '' since the start of the rebellion . 
Perhaps they were all Zarqawi 's closest lieutenants . 
We can expect the US and UK governments to seek to minimize the extent of their war crimes . 
But it 's time the media stopped collaborating .

2005-11-09,"Steffen Andersch , who has jumped to his death at the age of 21 , was a singer , guitarist , activist in the fight against fascism in his German homeland and a passionate photographer of the underside of London . 
The youngest son in a family with a communist background , he was often seriously ill as a child , but always struggled back using his musical skills to overcome difficulties . 
Together with his older brother Nils , he was a driving figure in the youth ANTIFA in his home town of Essen , organising numerous rallies against neo-Nazis and trying to protect asylum seekers from deportation . 
He was arrested for his activities but acquitted of public order offences . 
He also joined the anti-Iraq war rallies in London and Amsterdam as a peace activist . 
In 2004 , together with friends , my son turned an unoccupied house in Essen into an arts and events center . 
They invited locals to meet and interact with painters , sculptors , musicians and street artists . 
Their initiative led to negotiations between the city council and the young artists that resulted in the establishment earlier this year of a permanent center , providing studios for artists to work , a performance space , cafe and art lessons for local children . 
While a cultural studies student at Duisburg University , Steffen was a restless singer , songwriter and composer , playing and performing with three bands . 
A CD recorded by one group , known as Snow for Society , is about to be released in Germany . 
After numerous visits to London with his parents , starting during his childhood , Steffen began in his teens to photograph the city -LRB- mainly Brixton and Southwark -RRB- and the tube system . 
His London photographs were selected for several exhibitions in Germany . 
His last photo session , on August 7 , shows Giancarlo Neri 's sculpture , The Writer , at sunrise on Hampstead Heath . 
Steffen planned to exhibit this series in music sessions in Germany and in a book . 
Most of his music compositions and his extensive photographic work about London await publication . 
He is survived by his girlfriend Alice , his mother Annette , brother Nils and sister Kerstin in Germany , and by myself in London .

2005-11-10,"A name that lives in infamy The destruction of Falluja was an act of barbarism that ranks alongside My Lai , Guernica and Halabja One year ago this week , US-led occupying forces launched a devastating assault on the Iraqi city of Falluja . 
The mood was set by Lt Col Gary Brandl : `` The enemy has got a face . 
He 's called Satan . 
He 's in Falluja . 
And we 're going to destroy him . '' 
The assault was preceded by eight weeks of aerial bombardment . 
US troops cut off the city 's water , power and food supplies , condemned as a violation of the Geneva convention by a UN special rapporteur , who accused occupying forces of `` using hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population '' . 
Two-thirds of the city 's 300,000 residents fled , many to squatters ' camps without basic facilities . 
As the siege tightened , the Red Cross , Red Crescent and the media were kept out , while males between the ages of 15 and 55 were kept in . 
US sources claimed between 600 and 6,000 insurgents were holed up inside the city - which means that the vast majority of the remaining inhabitants were non-combatants . 
On November 8 , 10,000 US troops , supported by 2,000 Iraqi recruits , equipped with artillery and tanks , supported from the air by bombers and helicopter gunships , blasted their way into a city the size of Leicester . 
It took a week to establish control of the main roads ; another two before victory was claimed . 
The city 's main hospital was selected as the first target , the New York Times reported , `` because the US military believed it was the source of rumors about heavy casualties '' . 
An AP photographer described US helicopters killing a family of five trying to ford a river to safety . 
`` There were American snipers on top of the hospital shooting everyone , '' said Burhan Fasa'am , a photographer with the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation . 
`` With no medical supplies , people died from their wounds . 
Everyone in the street was a target for the Americans . '' 
The US also deployed incendiary weapons , including white phosphorous . 
`` Usually we keep the gloves on , '' Captain Erik Krivda said , but `` for this operation , we took the gloves off '' . 
By the end of operations , the city lay in ruins . 
Falluja 's compensation commissioner has reported that 36,000 of the city 's 50,000 homes were destroyed , along with 60 schools and 65 mosques and shrines . 
The US claims that 2,000 died , most of them fighters . 
When medical teams arrived in January they collected more than 700 bodies in only one third of the city . 
Iraqi NGOs and medical workers estimate between 4,000 and 6,000 dead , mostly civilians - a proportionately higher death rate than in Coventry and London during the blitz . 
The collective punishment inflicted on Falluja - with logistical and political support from Britain - was largely masked by the US and British media , which relied on reporters embedded with US troops . 
The BBC , in particular , offered a sanitised version of the assault : civilian suffering was minimized and the ethics and strategic logic of the attack largely unscrutinised . 
Falluja proved to be yet another of the war 's phantom turning points . 
Violent resistance spread to other cities . 
In the last two months , Tal-Afar , Haditha , Husaybah - all alleged terrorist havens heavily populated by civilians - have come under the hammer . 
Falluja is still so heavily patrolled that visitors have described it as `` a giant prison '' . 
Only a fraction of the promised reconstruction and compensation has materialised . 
Like Jallianwallah Bagh , Guernica , My Lai , Halabja and Grozny , Falluja is a place name that has become a symbol of unconscionable brutality . 
As the war in Iraq claims more lives , we need to ensure that this atrocity - so recent , so easily erased from public memory - is recognized as an example of the barbarism of nations that call themselves civilised .

2005-11-11,"Judging by Jarhead , Sam Mendes 's film about the first Gulf war , the American war movie is n't growing up much . 
But it is adapting to the times You can tell Sam Mendes 's Jarhead is self-conscious by the number of nervous references it makes to several of older and better war movies . 
Mendes is as slick and meretricious here in Desert Storm as he was in the suburbs of American Beauty and among the reach-me-down neo-noir cliches of Road to Perdition , but I congratulate him for taking on his big-budget predecessors like a new fish in the jailhouse preemptively stomping the wing daddies . 
First up is Apocalypse Now , whose Ride of the Valkyries sequence is viewed by a packed audience of ecstatically war-hungry Marines , fresh out of boot camp , all screaming `` Bu - Bu-Buh-Bom-Bom ! '' 
as the rockets fly and the bodies burn . 
Which , ironists may note , was probably not the effect intended by Francis Ford Coppola , who by many accounts let his own anti-war movie turn him into an on-set General Patton , a man whose biopic he 'd co-written a decade earlier . 
The Deerhunter , fraudulent then and now , fares worse . 
One Marine 's wife mails a video copy for him to watch with his platoon , but after the credits - including , cheekily , `` directed by Michael Cimino '' - the footage has been taped over by the grunt 's wife back home with footage of herself getting bonked by the neighbor . 
After congress is concluded she gives the lens the finger and dumps her Clean Marine . 
I like to think that 's also Mendes 's rigid digit to Cimino . 
Elsewhere , he 's not nearly so clever . 
His boot camp scenes are pure Full Metal Jacket , and in places the tone veers from M \* A \* S \* H \* - style service comedy to Catch-22 absurdism , propelled by the sun-dazed musings of sensitive soldier-writer Jake Gyllenhaal , himself a cliche harking back to self-conscious scribbling infantrymen such as James Jones and Norman Mailer . 
Jarhead seems unable to decide exactly what kind of war movie it wants to be . 
Judging by Jarhead , the American war movie is n't growing up much , but it is adapting to the times . 
Once upon a time , back in the Good War and after , it was John Wayne , lock-and-load , no doubts , no blood , and lashings of the Andrews Sisters . 
Then came Vietnam , fought on the myths those earlier movies promulgated , and everything went all `` frag the lieutenant ! '' 
, ears for souvenirs , the smell of napalm in the morning , and nothing but blood and doubt , all pumped up by Creedence and Stax . 
Everything was green and brown , an iconography of jungle and rice paddy , monsoon and mosquitoes . 
Of course , before Americans saw all this in the movies , they had to watch it on the news every night for a decade . 
No less green and wet were the recent second world war do-over movies like Saving Private Ryan , which let directors shed gallons of plasma that were n't permissible in the 1940s and 50s , and yet wave the flag as if John Wayne was still among us . 
Band of Brothers was broadcast literally on the eve of war , almost as if the Ministry of Truth had willed it : the handiest war-nostalgia boom ever . 
Still , they went easy on the Andrews Sisters , so there was an upside . 
Which brings us to Jarhead . 
Typically , the first Iraq movie made during the Iraq war proper turns out to be about the other Iraq war , the one that lasted 100 hours and offered no battle time , no money-shot , for most of the troops expecting to fight in it . 
If Jarhead had any discernible politics , it might give the infinitely savvier Three Kings a run for its money , but no : Mendes seems content to use one Marine 's comment as his own alibi : `` Fuck politics . 
The rest is bullshit . '' 
This is a fraudulent disavowal of reality heard pretty much daily from senators and pundits - and , I suspect , from movie execs eyeing potential receipts in the Red States - during our own Iraq war , the one with all the bodies . 
Still , just the accident of its release at this moment almost makes it feel more political than it is .

2005-11-12,"Amman Support for US brings a booming economy Bombings wreck image of safe haven from Iraq The bars are filled with tattooed ex-soldiers , young former officers and eastern European prostitutes . 
The men talk of the Iraq where they work for private security firms , and the women try to offer them an expensive escape . 
Amman has become the service center for western efforts to pacify and rebuild Iraq and Jordan 's once faltering economy is booming to the point of overheating . 
While many hotel guests are Jordanians , a large proportion are journalists , diplomats , soldiers , security guards and others who work in Iraq but use Amman as a base . 
While most of the victims of Wednesday 's suicide bombings were Jordanians , mainly at a wedding celebration , large numbers of Europeans and Americans were close to the explosion at the Grand Hyatt hotel . 
An al-Qaida statement posted on the internet described the three hotels that were attacked as `` filthy entertainment centres for the traitors and apostates of the umma -LRB- the Muslim world -RRB- and a safe haven for the infidel intelligence services '' . 
The decision of King Abdullah II to support the war in Iraq and the continued American presence there has led to many economic benefits but it has placed the country squarely in the enemy camp in the eyes of Islamic fundamentalists and particularly Abu Musab al Zarqawi , the Jordanian-born al-Qaida leader . 
The presence in Jordan of American special forces troops , employees of private security companies and western contractors for recuperation has made it an attractive target for militants fighting in Iraq . 
Jordan has a long porous border with Iraq , which is mostly uninhabited desert , and there is a large amount of traffic between the countries in which militants could hide . 
War in Iraq has brought an influx of western visitors and investment to Jordan . 
Prostitution has become more common , although it remains discreet . 
Amman even has a lap-dancing bar , although the dancers remain fully clothed and there is no physical contact with clients . 
One of the few establishments where eastern European prostitutes could be seen in public was the basement nightclub of the Grand Hyatt hotel . 
But the city is not just about rest and recuperation , it was also a safe haven for aid agencies and private companies to plan their work in Iraq . 
The United Nations , Red Cross and other organizations pulled out of Iraq after they became the targets of suicide bombs . 
Jordanian companies have been given contracts to provide services to the Iraqi administration such as refurbishing helicopters and training soldiers . 
To add to the boom , Jordan has become a bolthole for around half a million Iraqis and their assets , some of which have connections to the deposed Ba'athist regime and the insurgency . 
Before this week 's terrorist attack , the economy was growing by more than 7 % a year , property prices had more than doubled and the value of the Jordanian stock exchange had grown sixfold . 
It is a great success for a country which is mostly desert with few resources and hostile neighbors . 
On the eve of the war in Iraq , Jordanians were concerned they would suffer from its effects . 
The country was about to lose a $ 500m subsidy in free and cheap oil from Saddam Hussein and there was public anger at the government 's support for the United States . 
There were similar concerns in 1991 , when King Hussein remained neutral during the Gulf war . 
His son decided to do the opposite , which has led to an economic boom and terrorist attacks . 
Mohammad Abu Hammour , the head of the privatisation commission and a former finance minister , said the war in Iraq had positive and negative effects on Jordan . 
`` There are many investors who want to have joint ventures with Jordanian companies but at the same time there is little foreign interest in the privatisation of state companies as western investors see the risk as too great , '' he said . 
But the economic benefits have not filtered through to the majority of the population . 
The average wage is # 175 a month and most Jordanians would not be able to afford a meal at the Four Seasons or Sheraton hotels . 
Mr Hammour said the price of a modest apartment in Amman had risen from # 21,000 to # 49,000 in three years , making it very difficult for someone on an average salary to buy a home . 
A major danger facing Jordan is that its prosperity could remain unevenly distributed and the disparity in wealth could fuel social unrest that might find a focus in radical Islam . 
An ancient and modern city The city is built on seven hills on the eastern boundary of the Ajlun mountains . 
One of the oldest cities in the world , excavations have uncovered homes believed to have been built during the Chalcolithic period -LRB- circa 4500 - 3000 BC -RRB- . 
Later Amman became the capital of the Ammonites , a semitic people frequently mentioned in the Bible , and was known as Ammon . 
Egypt 's King Ptolemy II Philadelphus conquered the city in the third century BC and renamed it Philadelphia after himself ; the name was retained through Byzantine and Roman times . 
At the rise of Islam , the city 's name returned to its semitic origin of Ammon or Amman , after being taken by the Arab general Yazid ibn Abu Sufyan in AD 635 . 
By about 1300 the city had entirely disappeared for unknown causes . 
In 1878 the Ottoman Turks resettled the site with Circassian refugees from Russia ; it remained a small village until after the first world war . 
Transjordan became part of the Palestine mandate , but Britain severed it from western Palestine -LRB- 1921 -RRB- and established a protected emirate of Transjordan , under the rule of Abdullah bin al-Hussein . 
Amman became capital of this new country ; the city 's growth was accelerated at Jordan 's independence -LRB- 1946 -RRB- . 
The city is a thriving metropolis with a population of more than 1 million people . 
Its growth has been driven largely by political events in the region , especially the Arab-Israeli conflict which has drawn waves of Palestinian refugees to the city .

2005-11-13,"Lessons from the history man Robert Fisk charts the modern history of the Middle East as he examines the causes of current chaos in The Great War for Civilisation , says Rebecca Seal In 1905 , when the Middle East 's most modern crisis was in its infancy , American philosopher George Santayana wrote : ` Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . ' 
That remark came to mind when reading Robert Fisk 's latest book , which is so much more than a modern history of the Middle East . 
It starts with Fisk 's hair-raising 1997 meeting with Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan , then takes us via many of the trouble spots of the last three decades to conclude in Iraq . 
Fisk , the Independent 's veteran foreign correspondent , also examines the 1920 occupation of Iraq by British forces , the roots of the Arab-Israeli conflict and other events which lead us to the ludicrous present where soldiers from the most sophisticated armies in the world have to be protected by private security firms in Iraq and where the threat of terrorism is a fact of daily life from Bali to London . 
Fisk repeatedly emphasises messages that he feels should have been learned from history , as well as the arrogance of the decision-makers who ignored the past , or were ignorant of it . 
Did anyone heed the fact that in 1920 the well-armed British occupiers of Iraq were battered by a local insurgency which arose , among other places , in Basra ? 
Did anyone notice there has never , ever , been an easy occupation of this area ? 
Or that the mujahideen , who fought the Soviet occupiers of Afghanistan in the Eighties and have re-emerged in Iraq , would find a fertile recruiting ground in such towns as Fallujah among Iraqis who have been beaten or tortured or merely heard of atrocities by their occupiers ? 
` Torture works , ' boasted an American Special Forces friend of Fisk 's , a claim disproved by one man who claimed to have been tortured . ' 
I have a one-year-old daughter and I would happily put a bomb in her clothes and send her to the Americans to kill them ' , he said . 
Fisk claims the insurgency in Iraq could have been avoided if America and Britain had heeded bin Laden five weeks before the 2003 invasion , when he made it clear that if it went ahead , he would encourage all Muslims to co-operate with Saddam 's Baath party against the Americans and British . 
For Fisk : ` This was the moment the future guerrilla army fused with the future suicide bombers ... and we did n't even notice ' . 
But when the battle is about oil and power , decision-makers are n't looking at history for mistakes to avoid . 
They are too busy trying to get away with what they are doing . 
And there is a vast gap between knowing and caring . 
Robert Fisk , who has been dodging bullets for nearly 30 years , examines what motivates him , and others like him , to do this extraordinary job . 
He is n't above occasionally glamorising the tale , but there is a strong sense that this is , beyond his need to understand these wars , a chance for him to try to understand his other need to be present at all of them .

2005-11-14,"This picture from Jordanian state-run TV shows Sajida al-Rishawi confessing to her failed attempt to set off an explosives belt inside one of the three Amman hotels . 
Photograph : Marco di Lauro\/Getty In her black coat and white headscarf , Sajida al-Rishawi looked like many other Arab women . 
But the shapeless garment made it easy for her to conceal a belt of explosives and a belt of ball bearings - and her mission , along with her husband , to blow up a hotel full of wedding guests . 
Appearing on Jordanian television last night the woman , 35 , described how she had traveled from Iraq to Jordan to play her part in last Wednesday 's triple suicide attack on three Amman hotels that left 57 dead and more than 90 wounded . 
Wearing the disarmed explosive belt over her coat , she turned around as if modelling it and demonstrated how she had planned to pull the red cord that would have detonated the explosives . 
Once her belt had failed to detonate as she stood among a crowd of wedding guests , however , she fled to an apartment in Amman , where she was arrested yesterday morning . 
Wringing her hands but sounding calm and confident , she described to an interviewer on live television how she and her husband , Ali Hussein Shamari , had traveled from Iraq to the Jordanian capital . 
There they rented an apartment and her husband taught her how to use the bomb . 
`` He said it was for the attack on hotels in Jordan , '' she said . 
`` We rented a car and entered the hotel on November 5 . 
My husband and I went inside and he went to one corner and I went to another . 
`` There was a wedding at the hotel with children , women and men inside . 
My husband detonated -LRB- his bomb -RRB- and I tried to explode my belt but it would n't . 
People fled running and I left running with them , '' she said . 
At a press conference earlier in the day , Marwan Muasher , the deputy prime minister of Jordan , said that when the husband noticed his wife was having trouble detonating her bomb by pulling its primer cord , he `` pushed her out of the ballroom '' . 
`` Once she was out , he blew himself up , '' he told reporters . 
The bomb strapped to the man 's body was packed with the powerful explosive RDX and ball bearings , and was designed to kill many people . 
If his wife had succeeded in her attempt , the carnage would have been much worse . 
Shamari killed the majority of the 57 bombing victims at the Radisson hotel . 
All were Jordanians or Palestinians . 
The fathers of the bride and groom were killed and the mother of the bride is in a coma . 
Although those holding their hands were killed , the married couple escaped unhurt . 
Mr Muasher said the three successful suicide bombers who attacked the Grand Hyatt , Radisson and Days Inn hotels were Iraqis from Anbar , the Iraqi province bordering Jordan . 
They were named as Shamari , 35 ; Rawad Jassem Mohammed Abed , 23 ; and Safaa Mohammed Ali , 23 . 
Ms Rishawi was identified as the sister of Mubarak Atrous al-Rishawi , a leader of al-Qaida in Iraq in Anbar province . 
He was believed to have been killed by US forces in Falluja last year . 
He was reported to have been the deputy of Abu Musab Zarqawi , the Jordanian-born leader of al-Qaida in Iraq who has been sentenced to death in absentia by a Jordanian court . 
The four bombers drove into Jordan from Iraq on November 4 , five days before the attacks , and rented an apartment in western Amman . 
They left their apartment on Wednesday and took taxis to the hotels , including the Radisson , where almost 300 people were attending a wedding reception in one of the hotel 's ballrooms . 
Mr Muasher said : `` It is clear from the way she was dressed and the explosive belts with ball bearings that they wanted to target innocent civilians , and also wanted to inflict the biggest number of casualties and victims . '' 
The arrest of Ms Rishawi appears to confirm the authenticity of a series of statements posted on the internet by al-Qaida in Iraq . 
The group said it had sent four Iraqis , including a husband and wife , to carry out the bombings but Jordanian police said they found the bodies of only three male bombers . 
The al-Qaida statements attempted to justify the attacks on the hotels because they were frequented by prostitutes , spies and `` apostates '' . 
King Abdullah II of Jordan told American television that the Iraqis had deliberately tried to kill Jordanians rather than westerners . 
`` This was nothing to do with the west . 
This targeted Jordanian citizens - innocent men , women and children , '' he said . 
`` The majority of the country poured out to denounce what Zarqawi and al-Qaida did , calling for Zarqawi to be brought to justice , for him to burn in hell . '' 
He said that Jordan was `` suffering from the effects '' of the US-led Iraq war , `` but we are all hoping , I think as is everybody in the world , that at the end of the day Iraq will be part of the international community '' . 
Amman 's western hotels are populated by guests from all over the world . 
Most are engaged in work in Jordan and Iraq . 
However , Jordanians regularly use the banqueting rooms , restaurants , health clubs and lobbies for business and personal reasons .

2005-11-14,"The Mail on Sunday 's fulminator-in-chief , tells James Silver why polemicists are so important , what he really thinks about David Cameron - and how he is proud of his foes but does not like being called bonkers Britain , as depicted by the Mail on Sunday 's fulminator-in-chief , Peter Hitchens , appears at times to stand on the brink of apocalypse . 
According to his columns - which are molten Old Testament fury shot through with visceral wit - we live in a land of `` burglaries , muggings , swearing , pools of vomit , MRSA , rave parties and traveller encampments . '' 
Those on council estates are `` surrounded by the tattooed , with their pit bulls and serial partners , crack dens , joy-riders , open-all-hours pubs and the rest ... '' For their part , the police are dismissed as `` wooden , officious twerps in dayglo jackets '' who have sided with the yobs and given up on crime . 
Of single mothers , he wrote : `` It can not be long before Britain has its first 24-year-old granny . 
When you abolish husbands and fathers that is what you get . 
As the rules of civilised life are swept away and the only people interested in getting married are lesbian clergywomen , there will soon be thousands of them . '' 
Hitchens lays the blame squarely at the door of the `` permissive society '' . 
`` Like several governments before it , Labor has actively encouraged promiscuity by undermining marriage , promoting ` alternative lifestyles ' and preaching immorality in schools - and , of course , by continuing to subsidise the results . '' 
Other weeping Hitchens sores include : immigration , which is `` limitless '' and `` unmonitored '' ; New Labor - `` a horrible rabble of fakes , wreckers and frauds '' who are beyond the pale for `` dismantling Britain as a free country '' ; the Tories - invariably dismissed as `` the Useless party '' ; the EU - `` horrible '' , `` a monster '' and `` anti-British '' . 
And leftwing intellectuals - hell-bent on turning the UK into `` a meaningless , history-free and cultureless wilderness '' . 
He may view himself as one of the last sane voices in an increasingly boisterous asylum , but there is little fire and brimstone about Hitchens in person . 
He is friendly , if a touch gauche , courteous and dapperly dressed . 
We sit at a small table in a smoky Italian cafe around the corner from Associated Newspapers ' Kensington offices . 
His baritone voice booms over the clatter of crockery and the snorts of the espresso machine . 
People on nearby tables find themselves eavesdropping as they stir their cappuccinos . 
I am fascinated by his use of language , the `` pools of vomit '' , the `` pit bulls '' and the `` abolished '' fathers . 
Does he really think that `` lesbian clergywomen '' are `` the only people interested in marriage '' ? 
He replies : `` Caricaturists are among the finest artists because they alert you to the real characteristics of the people they draw . '' 
I try another one . 
Is Britain literally being `` dismantled '' ? 
If you take the characteristics of the country as being a working system of law , institutions , morality , custom , that sort of invisible web of internalised beliefs and knowledge which makes it possible for society to function - then it is being very rapidly dismantled , yes . '' 
Hitchens , 54 , is well aware that many on the left see him as a swivel-eyed obsessive and , to a certain extent , he revels in his enemy-of-the-chattering-classes persona . 
He is , he proclaims , `` proud of his foes '' , even if over the years he has had to develop something of a thick skin . 
`` I know a lot of people consider me to be disreputable or foaming at the mouth , but you have to learn not to care , or at least not to mind . 
I do n't like being called ` bonkers ' and I think to some extent it demeans people who use phrases like that . 
But I take comfort from the fact that most totalitarian regimes tend to classify their opponents as mentally disordered . '' 
Hitchens ' political zealotry may be explained , in part , by his journey across the political landscape from former student agitator and `` Trot '' to doom-merchant rightwinger . 
He reveals he was `` much further to the left '' than many of his contemporaries at York university in the early 1970s . 
`` I got my jabs against -LRB- being a Lefty -RRB- in a way that they did n't . 
I got the full raging contagion , they just got a mild version . 
I get asked tediously how come you 're on ` the right ' when you used to be on ` the left ' , to the extent that these categories mean anything . 
What is much more interesting is that so many people who were leftwing in their student years are still leftwing . 
Why do n't middle-aged people who are at the height of their professions , well-off , paying large amounts of tax , generally part of the establishment , become Conservatives any more ? '' 
It may be hard to picture now , but he continued to deliver `` small bundles of the Socialist Worker to embarrassed people who 'd filled in a form '' , throughout his first job as a reporter on the Swindon Advertiser . 
However , he concedes : `` By then I was having doubts about the project . 
I joined the Labor party in 1977 and remember campaigning for Ken Livingstone 's parliamentary candidature for Hampstead in 1979 - with some reluctance as I 'd not voted for his selection . 
But I knew he would n't win . 
It was fairly guilt-free . '' 
Soon afterwards , Hitchens became a political reporter at the Daily Express and thought it `` no longer appropriate to carry a party card '' . 
His 24-year tenure at the Express , which included stints as correspondent in Moscow and Washington , came to an end soon after Richard Desmond took over the group . 
Desmond 's `` adult '' business interests prompted a bout of soul-searching in Hitchens , eventually leading him to quit for the Mail on Sunday . 
Does he disapprove of Desmond ? 
`` I do disapprove of him . 
How could I not ? 
It would be ridiculous if I did n't . 
I met him once and to my great shame and regret I shook hands with him . 
Good manners , I 'm afraid , prevented me from refusing to shake his hand . '' 
Another hand he has recently clasped belongs to his brother , Christopher , the Washington-based essayist and commentator . 
They fell out after an unfathomable row over a joke about Stalinism . 
They did not speak to each other for four years until they were reconciled publicly at a Guardian event at the Hay festival earlier this year . 
They have exchanged no more than a `` couple of emails '' since . 
`` We were never particularly close , '' says Hitchens . 
It has been suggested that there is a sense of rivalry between Christopher - the left-of-centre firebrand who famously backed the Iraq war , drawing the ire of many on the left who accused him of switching sides , and Peter - the moral conservative who speaks up for the silent , decent majority who cower behind their clipped hedges and memories of a better England . 
Peter 's slightly disingenuous response is that they are not in competition as they began in different journalistic fields . 
`` Christopher 's point of entry was commentary and essays . 
And I became a pundit by accident . 
I could always see it was an attractive billet . 
But the process of becoming one was a series of accidents . '' 
Unlike his brother , Peter Hitchens was , and continues to be , a vociferous opponent of the Iraq war . 
He never bought the WMD argument and felt `` his intelligence was being insulted '' by the Bush-Blair `` baby-talk '' . 
Did he admire his brother 's stance on Iraq - a position which has lost him many friends ? 
Hitchens grudgingly concedes : `` Sure , any principled position is admirable even if it 's wrong . 
It 's rigid positions taken for corrupt and disreputable reasons or because you are a coward which are to be scorned . '' 
It is notable that he refuses to offer his brother so much as a whisper of defense over the George Galloway affair , despite the Respect MP describing Christopher as a `` slug '' leaving behind `` a trail of slime '' . 
He says : `` I am not in that argument . 
The great New York debate -LRB- in which the MP and the columnist recently clashed over the Iraq war -RRB- seemed to me to be about two positions I have nothing to do with . 
One , if you support the war you are an imperialist , racist fascist . 
Two , if you are against the war , you are a toady of dictators . 
I do n't think either holds any water . 
As for Galloway , I 'll wait for the proof . 
He is much alleged against but I 'm a believer in the presumption of innocence . '' 
Hitchens believes the Tory party to be `` institutionally dead '' , frequently targeting the party for excoriation in his columns . 
`` The conventional wisdom is that Labor have stolen Tory policies , '' he says . 
`` The truth is over the past 50 years , the Tories have stolen Labor policies . 
The Tory party has never fought a single battle . 
It did n't fight for marriage , for grammar schools or a proper criminal justice system . 
In fact you will find many of the worst reforms of the criminal justice system were put in place by Conservative governments . 
And it fell victim to the belief that the market could replace morality or Christianity . '' 
Unsurprisingly , he is no fan of leadership hopeful David Cameron either . 
`` All he wants to do is be like Labor . 
He just wants ministerial cars . '' 
What does he make of the drugs row that has dogged Cameron 's campaign ? 
`` What matters is not whether someone has taken drugs , but what their attitude is subsequently . 
I do n't know whether Cameron has or not . 
But if he did -LRB- take drugs -RRB- and then said ' I strongly disapprove of it and it was a seriously wrong thing to do ' , then I would n't care if he 'd taken drugs . '' 
A question pops into my head . 
`` Have you ever taken drugs ? '' 
`` Yes '' , he replies , refusing to elaborate . 
Richard Littlejohn said that the true job of the columnist is to chuck beer bottles from the back of the room at those in authority . 
For Hitchens it is rather more than that . 
`` There is a part of the tradition of liberty which requires hecklers , but if that were all it was it would n't really be enough . 
The main thing I want to do is to introduce ideas into the public discourse which then people who are deemed to be respectable can take up in a slightly quieter fashion . '' 
Then the writer , who was once told to `` Sit down and stop being bad ! '' 
by Blair , adds : `` But then again hitting the prime minister in the face with a ripe tomato from time to time is good for liberty . '' 
And , one imagines , for the Hitchens soul .

2005-11-14,"Corporal Roger Eustis , 47 , a civilian working for the MoD , was compulsorily mobilised for Operation Telic 1 , the invasion of Iraq in January 2003 , and demobilised in September that year . 
His specialist unit provided port operators and vessel crew . 
I left because my missus did n't want me to be in the TA any more . 
I was just doing a back-office job in Iraq , based mostly in Umm Qasr . 
I was n't doing a war-fighting role so I was n't in incredible danger . 
You could have put a 19-year-old guy out of school doing it . 
I came back and stayed in the TA for two years . 
I eventually left because my wife did not want me to be mobilised again - but it was my decision to leave . 
All the way down the line I have said family first , job second , reserves third . 
The key thing for people who were in the early deployment is that TA families do n't have anywhere near the support that the regulars take for granted . 
She did n't know anybody else who was in the same boat . 
Regular army wives all know each other and have a support network . 
Also , I was losing # 500 a month . 
I was quite prepared to go to Iraq . 
I remain proud of the minimal contribution I made . 
The only sour note has been that , two years down the line , I have yet to receive my medal . 
In contrast , the TA unit based in Tony Blair 's constituency , who were deployed a year after us , were issued with their medals in a fine photo opportunity by the prime minister about a month after they returned . 
Mr Eustis 's medal eventually arrived in the post last Thursday Gary Haran Doyle , 34 , from Earlsfield in London , was a Lance Corporal working as a mechanic in the TA . 
In civilian life he is an investment banking consultant and earns # 200,000 a year . 
I joined the TA in 1988 when I was 17 , during the height of the `` red threat '' . 
I served in Bosnia on Operations Resolute and Lode Star -LRB- 1996-97 -RRB- . 
When Operation Telic came about I was firmly in the camp that felt taking out Saddam and imposing a democratic government was a good thing . 
I knew that 45-minute missile readiness was an exaggeration . 
But I was n't called up for the invasion . 
I had the opportunity to volunteer or be called up later and I personally decided it was n't for me . 
Although I backed the government with its new foreign policy objective , I decided that somebody else could do it . 
I understand why the government has issues with paying high-earners . 
If they were going to pay me # 100,000 for driving a truck I understand why they would have trouble justifying it . 
I do miss it . 
I would much rather spend a weekend running around with the lads in the TA once a month than being on the slopes in Austria which is what I do now . 
The TA is much more rewarding , the opportunities to serve in an operational role are wonderful but because of the threat of being called up and having to go through the rigmarole of what you earn , I decided to leave . 
A sergeant major , 39 , who had been in the TA for more than 20 years and resigned after serving in Iraq . 
He does not want to be identified because of his mental health problems . 
I was mobilised with just three days ' notice on Operation Telic 1 . 
I received the letter on the Tuesday and had to attend Chilwell -LRB- the TA training and mobilisation center in Nottingham -RRB- on the Friday . 
I came back from Iraq in July 2003 and due to a monumental cock-up in the army pay office in Glasgow , found that my ex-wife 's payments through the CSA had been collected by the army but were never paid to her . 
My employers were instructed to take 85 % of my salary in deductions . 
I was left with # 280 a month to feed my girlfriend and young family . 
By the time I got back from Iraq I was credit blacklisted . 
It 's just gone from a bad situation to worse . 
I do n't think it 's a unique experience . 
Financially , it 's been a nightmare . 
Then there was the training and kit aspect . 
Most people that went out there had cursory training . 
When we mobilised , supplies at Chilwell were short . 
The war left me damaged in a number of ways . 
I came back in late July , just when David Kelly took his own life . 
People were then being very questioning about the military operation that I had just been on . 
I would be interested to see how a regular soldier coped with this type of thing . 
I bet he does n't have people in his work coming up and saying I bet you feel bad about being involved in that war . 
I boarded an aircraft at 1am in Basra , landed in the UK at 8.30 am British time and got chucked up to Chilwell . 
The medical checking was a joke in terms of depleted uranium . 
By 6pm they said , `` that 's it lads , you can go '' . 
We had only had a 10-20 minute presentation on post-traumatic stress disorder at Basra airport . 
It was given at 11.30 pm at night when we were absolutely fragged and had been through a real nightmare . 
I was sent home with no counselling or decompression talk . 
I eventually had a mental breakdown . 
I went to speak to my doctor because I was having great problems sleeping . 
It took him six weeks to get hold of my medical records from the army . 
In the end it was their opinion that I had PTSD . 
I was signed off for a course of counselling and spent a week in a psychiatric unit because I felt my head was going to explode . 
I was considering taking my own life . 
And while I am having the breakdown it is my civilian employer that is taking the hit . 
The army has screwed me up and spat me out at the other end . 
A major , 39 , was a nurse in the regular army for three years before joining the TA . 
He was mobilised for the Iraq war and left upon his return after six years ' service . 
Significant numbers of TA medical personnel were mobilised in early February 2003 , including many from my unit . 
I was not and assumed I was not required . 
It was a shock when about a month later my mobilisation papers arrived . 
I had to quickly make a will and ensure that money was not an issue . 
My wife does not drive and we have no family within 200 miles and with her job and our small baby son to cope with it was going to be tough . 
However , I felt compelled to go . 
The army has paid for me to go sailing and skiing and I saw this as payback time . 
I had , for all my personal misgivings about the war , a duty to the army and most especially as an army nurse , a duty to those soldiers fighting it . 
We were told our training had been cut short as a result of our late mobilisation . 
I suspect the late mobilisations were a result of the government 's reluctance to be seen to be preparing for war . 
We had no in-theatre training or any time to acclimatise to the desert . 
We were dumped in a war at very short notice . 
No desert kit was issued , though we did get body armor . 
We should have had three Combopens which are used to combat the effects of nerve agents . 
There were not enough to go around . 
The canisters for our respirators were out of date . 
In theater , casualty bags used in the event of a soldier not being able to wear his respirator were in desperately short supply . 
Instead of one per bed we had only two in the whole hospital . 
We were 198 short . 
Some clinical equipment was also in short supply , such as urine bottles and hand soap . 
The body armor issued in the UK had to be handed in to equip the frontline soldiers . 
It seemed unbelievable that we had been sent to war because our enemy might have WMDs , yet our soldiers were under-equipped to defend themselves from that very threat . 
Once the war was over , the two regular field hospitals were sent home before ours . 
The effect on our morale was devastating and when I spoke to my wife on the phone she was so choked she could n't speak . 
I think it was at that point I knew my future in the TA was untenable . 
When I got home my wife was certainly pleased to see me but I knew she resented my absence and my son did not recognize me . 
It hurt like hell . 
Geraint Hughes joined the TA `` out of curiosity '' in 1999 at 24 and was a Lance Corporal with the London Irish Rifles -LRB- the London Regiment -RRB- before requesting his discharge this year . 
He volunteered to go to Iraq in March 2004 . 
My task was to command a four-man team in Basra , and I 'm happy to say that all those I was responsible for -LRB- as well as the platoon as a whole -RRB- came back from Iraq alive . 
After we were demobilised in December 2004 I found adjusting to civilian life a little tricky , but now I 've become adjusted to civvy street . 
My platoon still sticks together , its members stay in touch , and every now and again we meet up for a few beers and for memory 's sake . 
I have a lot of time for my former platoon buddies , and feel glad to have experienced the camaraderie that military veterans speak so much of . 
I left the TA in April this year , mainly because I finally managed to get myself a full-time lecturing post . 
This meant moving to Swindon which made it impossible to train with the London Regiment . 
I could have joined a TA unit in Swindon - there 's a barracks 15 minutes walk from my flat - but I have decided to focus on my academic career . 
I have also , throughout my military career , only worn the headdress and cap-badge of the London Irish , and have no intention of joining another regiment . 
As they say , once you have worn the caubeen -LRB- the Irish soldier 's headdress -RRB- no other hat fits . 
Also , at 30 , I am no spring chicken , and the times when I could happily tab with a heavy bergen on my back , and a rifle in my hand , for kilometres on end has well and truly gone . 
I have absolutely no regrets about serving on Telic - in fact , I 'm pretty sure that I would have regretted not going . 
For all the hard training , the separation from family and friends , the dangers and the days when I was tired , bored , hungry , hot and stressed , it was worth it . 
For all the cock-ups in postwar reconstruction , and the blunders in Washington and London , I still think that the war was necessary , and that leaving Saddam unrestrained and in power would have had disastrous consequences for the Iraqi people , if not for the region as a whole . 
In the end I felt that the work we did on the ground did help ordinary Iraqis . 
"
2005-11-15,"The US used chemical weapons in Iraq - and then lied about it Now we know napalm and phosphorus bombs have been dropped on Iraqis , why have the hawks failed to speak out ? 
Did US troops use chemical weapons in Falluja ? 
The answer is yes . 
The proof is not to be found in the documentary broadcast on Italian TV last week , which has generated gigabytes of hype on the internet . 
It 's a turkey , whose evidence that white phosphorus was fired at Iraqi troops is flimsy and circumstantial . 
But the bloggers debating it found the smoking gun . 
The first account they unearthed in a magazine published by the US army . 
In the March 2005 edition of Field Artillery , officers from the 2nd Infantry 's fire support element boast about their role in the attack on Falluja in November last year : `` White Phosphorous . 
WP proved to be an effective and versatile munition . 
We used it for screening missions at two breeches and , later in the fight , as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes when we could not get effects on them with HE -LRB- high explosive -RRB- . 
We fired ` shake and bake ' missions at the insurgents , using WP to flush them out and HE to take them out . '' 
The second , in California 's North County Times , was by a reporter embedded with the marines in the April 2004 siege of Falluja . '' 
` Gun up ! ' 
Millikin yelled ... grabbing a white phosphorus round from a nearby ammo can and holding it over the tube . 
Bogert yelled , as Millikin dropped it . 
The boom kicked dust around the pit as they ran through the drill again and again , sending a mixture of burning white phosphorus and high explosives they call ` shake 'n' bake ' into ... buildings where insurgents have been spotted all week . '' 
White phosphorus is not listed in the schedules of the Chemical Weapons Convention . 
It can be legally used as a flare to illuminate the battlefield , or to produce smoke to hide troop movements from the enemy . 
Like other unlisted substances , it may be deployed for `` Military purposes ... not dependent on the use of the toxic properties of chemicals as a method of warfare '' . 
But it becomes a chemical weapon as soon as it is used directly against people . 
A chemical weapon can be `` any chemical which through its chemical action on life processes can cause death , temporary incapacitation or permanent harm '' . 
White phosphorus is fat-soluble and burns spontaneously on contact with the air . 
According to globalsecurity.org : `` The burns usually are multiple , deep , and variable in size . 
The solid in the eye produces severe injury . 
The particles continue to burn unless deprived of atmospheric oxygen ... If service members are hit by pieces of white phosphorus , it could burn right down to the bone . '' 
As it oxidises , it produces smoke composed of phosphorus pentoxide . 
According to the standard US industrial safety sheet , the smoke `` releases heat on contact with moisture and will burn mucous surfaces ... Contact ... can cause severe eye burns and permanent damage . '' 
Until last week , the US state department maintained that US forces used white phosphorus shells `` very sparingly in Fallujah , for illumination purposes '' . 
They were fired `` to illuminate enemy positions at night , not at enemy fighters '' . 
Confronted with the new evidence , on Thursday it changed its position . 
`` We have learned that some of the information we were provided ... is incorrect . 
White phosphorous shells , which produce smoke , were used in Fallujah not for illumination but for screening purposes , ie obscuring troop movements and , according to ... Field Artillery magazine , ` as a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines and spider holes ... ' The article states that US forces used white phosphorus rounds to flush out enemy fighters so that they could then be killed with high explosive rounds . '' 
The US government , in other words , appears to admit that white phosphorus was used in Falluja as a chemical weapon . 
The invaders have been forced into a similar climbdown over the use of napalm in Iraq . 
In December 2004 , the Labor MP Alice Mahon asked the British armed forces minister Adam Ingram `` whether napalm or a similar substance has been used by the coalition in Iraq -LRB- a -RRB- during and -LRB- b -RRB- since the war '' . 
`` No napalm , '' the minister replied , `` has been used by coalition forces in Iraq either during the war-fighting phase or since . '' 
This seemed odd to those who had been paying attention . 
There were widespread reports that in March 2003 US marines had dropped incendiary bombs around the bridges over the Tigris and the Saddam Canal on the way to Baghdad . 
The commander of Marine Air Group 11 admitted that `` We napalmed both those approaches '' . 
Embedded journalists reported that napalm was dropped at Safwan Hill on the border with Kuwait . 
In August 2003 the Pentagon confirmed that the marines had dropped `` mark 77 firebombs '' . 
Though the substance these contained was not napalm , its function , the Pentagon 's information sheet said , was `` remarkably similar '' . 
While napalm is made from petrol and polystyrene , the gel in the mark 77 is made from kerosene and polystyrene . 
I doubt it makes much difference to the people it lands on . 
So in January this year , the MP Harry Cohen refined Mahon 's question . 
He asked `` whether mark 77 firebombs have been used by coalition forces '' . 
The US , the minister replied , has `` confirmed to us that they have not used mark 77 firebombs , which are essentially napalm canisters , in Iraq at any time '' . 
The US government had lied to him . 
Mr Ingram had to retract his statements in a private letter to the MPs in June . 
We were told that the war with Iraq was necessary for two reasons . 
Saddam Hussein possessed biological and chemical weapons and might one day use them against another nation . 
And the Iraqi people needed to be liberated from his oppressive regime , which had , among its other crimes , used chemical weapons to kill them . 
Tony Blair , Colin Powell , William Shawcross , David Aaronovitch , Nick Cohen , Ann Clwyd and many others referred , in making their case , to Saddam 's gassing of the Kurds in Halabja in 1988 . 
They accused those who opposed the war of caring nothing for the welfare of the Iraqis . 
Given that they care so much , why has none of these hawks spoken out against the use of unconventional weapons by coalition forces ? 
Ann Clwyd , the Labor MP who turned from peace campaigner to chief apologist for an illegal war , is , as far as I can discover , the only one of these armchair warriors to engage with the issue . 
In May this year , she wrote to the Guardian to assure us that reports that a `` modern form of napalm '' has been used by US forces `` are completely without foundation . 
Coalition forces have not used napalm - either during operations in Falluja , or at any other time '' . 
How did she know ? 
The foreign office minister told her . 
Before the invasion , Clwyd traveled through Iraq to investigate Saddam 's crimes against his people . 
She told the Commons that what she found moved her to tears . 
After the invasion , she took the minister 's word at face value , when a 30-second search on the internet could have told her it was bunkum . 
It makes you wonder whether she really gave a damn about the people for whom she claimed to be campaigning . 
Saddam , facing a possible death sentence , is accused of mass murder , torture , false imprisonment and the use of chemical weapons . 
He is certainly guilty on all counts . 
So , it now seems , are those who overthrew him . 
"
2005-11-17,"A new wave of political bloggers is challenging Britain 's old media pundits . 
But who are they , and which ones matter ?

In the days after September 11 2001 , a Londoner in his 30s who prefers to be known only as David T made two grim discoveries . 
The first , and most upsetting , was that a close friend from school had died in the collapse of the World Trade Centre towers . 
The second discovery - in a way the more disorienting of the two - was what had happened to another former friend . 
In the years since the two had known each other well , he had become a spokesman for a prominent Islamic fundamentalist organization , and now , in statements to the media , he was openly applauding the attacks . 
David T 's experience was hardly typical , of course . 
`` It was the kind of moment where you think : OK , hang on - how do I even begin to make sense of that ? '' 
David says today , over bottles of beer in a north London bar . 
`` And that 's what I 've been doing for the last three years , really . '' 
Harry 's Place , the `` blog '' to which he is now a prolific contributor , has become one focus of Britain 's culture of political blogging - regularly updated online journals of opinion and debate - which has burgeoned in the years since 9\/11 . 
Samizdata , by some measures the nation 's most successful independent blog , claims around 15,000 different visitors a day ; Harry 's Place gets perhaps 9,000 . 
The phenomenon may not yet have reached the wild heights of the US , where bloggers have claimed credit for several real-world political upsets , including the resignations of the news anchor Dan Rather and the Senate Republican leader Trent Lott . 
But what has emerged here is a fully fledged alternative wing of the opinion industry , challenging the primacy of newspaper commentators . 
All political viewpoints thrive within it , but one has become notably prevalent : the stance generally identified as `` pro-war left '' , of which Harry 's Place is an example . 
It is a line of argument that seems not to have diminished , in stridency or popularity , as the Iraq debacle has worsened . 
Exerting influence as a member of this new commentariat is not just a matter of how many readers one attracts ; it 's a question of which ones . 
`` The freakiest thing is when you hear -LRB- a prominent commentator or politician -RRB- quote back a line or a phrase that you 've written , or something from a text you 've brought to light , '' notes Mick Fealty , who runs the non-partisan blog Slugger O'Toole , covering Northern Irish politics . 
`` Just last weekend , I read a whole sentence , in an editorial in one of the Irish Sundays , that I 'd used the Friday before . '' 
Samizdata , arguably the grandfather of British political blogs , is operated from a large and dimly lit flat in a pristine mansion block in south-west London . 
There are a few computers at the back of the main room , but the dominant feature is a leather-lined drinks bar - installed , according to Samizdata 's founder , Perry de Havilland , by a double agent , who knew the flat 's former owner and who paid for it with money from both MI5 and the KGB . 
-LRB- The flat is also now the headquarters of the Big Blog Company , a consultancy run by some of the Samizdata bloggers , which advises businesses on how to exploit the phenomenon . -RRB- 
A vintage pistol lying on a side-table gives a hint of the Samizdata attitude ; a more modern gun appears in a photograph on the blog 's front page , on top of a copy of The Open Society and Its Enemies , Karl Popper 's anti-totalitarian polemic . 
`` The Samizdata people are a bunch of sinister and heavily armed globalist Illuminati , who seek to infect the entire world with the values of personal liberty and -LRB- private -RRB- property , '' the site says . 
It was originally named Libertarian Samizdata , but too many of those involved became unhappy with the label : characteristically for libertarians , it seems , they were uncomfortable subscribing to a group ideology . 
`` We are ... a varied group made up of social individualists , libertarians , extropians , futurists , ` Porcupines ' , Karl Popper fetishists , recovering neo-conservatives , crazed Ayn Rand worshippers ... cypherpunks , minarchists , kritarchists and wild-eyed anarcho-capitalists from Britain , North America , Australia and Europe , '' the site now explains , unhelpfully . 
As I arrive , De Havilland is laughing , nearly hysterically , at a blog by Oliver Kamm , a London hedge-fund manager and member of the `` pro-war left '' who now also writes a column for the Times . 
`` Just marvellous , '' says De Havilland . 
`` I was thinking of making it Samizdata quote of the day . 
It 's something to the effect that , well , there 's no point in denying that our involvement in Iraq has inflamed -LRB- Islamist totalitarian -RRB- opinion . 
Why should we deny it ? 
It 's something we should be proud of ! '' 
September 11 caused many ideological fissures , of course . 
But it 's a fair bet that the split in British libertarianism - hardly a prominent movement in the first place - is probably one of the least well known . 
Some libertarians opposed any military response to the attacks , on the grounds that armies are tools of governments , and government is largely a bad thing . 
Others supported the war in Afghanistan , and later the war in Iraq , as attempts to spread or safeguard liberty . 
`` It was between those who said it was just another big-government thing , '' says De Havilland , `` and those who said , ` Excuse me , guys , but these nutjobs are trying to fucking kill us ! ' '' 
Samizdata published its first entry on November 2 2001 . 
`` I look forward to hearing from all those out there in ` establishment punditland ' who sneered at the effect of the US bombing , '' De Havilland wrote in an early posting as he watched the Taliban fall . 
`` Establishment punditland '' was Samizdata 's target from the start . 
In the US , the birthplace of blog culture , it was easy to see how almost any viewpoints expressed online were going to count as a breath of fresh air . 
All they needed to do to distinguish themselves was to diverge from the New York Times 's establishment liberalism and from the ranting of rightwing talk radio . 
Britain 's press , by contrast , has long been more politically diverse and unashamedly partisan , which may explain the blogs ' lesser impact here . 
De Havilland 's collaborator Adriana Cronin , who developed her vociferous views as a reaction to growing up in communist Czechoslovakia , laughs off suggestions that blogs might literally replace the mainstream media , but there is no disguising her passion . 
`` If we had a slogan , it would be , ` We ca n't change the way news is written , but we can change the way people read the news . ' 
So what we 're saying is - '' `` We 're not competing with newspapers , '' De Havilland interrupts . 
-LRB- This is a habit of his , though it may also be a beneficial quality in a blogger : he is n't willing to wait before sounding off . -RRB- 
`` But I tell you who we are in competition with , 100 % direct competition , and that 's your op-ed writers . 
We do n't have a reporter in Kandahar , and you might , it 's true - although in time we might have a blogger in Kandahar . 
But for the moment , sure : if your guy in Kandahar says X blew up Y , then X blew up Y. But when your editorial guy says , ` This is what it means , ' that 's when we say , ` Excuse me ! 
You 're completely wrong ! ' '' 
According to Wikipedia , the communally edited online encyclopedia , the term `` weblog '' was probably coined by the pioneering computer programmer John Barger . 
As early as December 1997 , Barger began posting brief daily updates to his website , Robot Wisdom , with particular reference to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict - thereby initiating one particular argument that still dominates weblogs today . 
It was these brief , frequent , personal and opinionated updates that came to define the form . 
`` Blog '' , the shortened version of the word - which also serves as a verb , meaning `` to run a blog '' or `` to add news postings to your blog '' - probably came from one early practitioner , Peter Merholz , who meant it as a joke . 
`` For what it 's worth , I 've decided to pronounce the word ` weblog ' as ` wee-blog ' . 
Or ` blog ' for short , '' he wrote on his site in 1999 . 
`` I did n't think much of it , '' he explained later . 
`` I was just being silly , shifting the syllabic break one letter to the left . 
I started using the word in my posts , and some folks , when emailing me , would use it too . 
I enjoyed its crudeness , its dissonance . '' 
There was something about the concept that lent itself to strident opinions on current affairs , and quickly , a few figures - the gay conservative British expatriate Andrew Sullivan , for example , and Josh Marshall , of the liberal Talking Points Memo - rose to prominence . 
Broadcasting your opinions is not the only way to blog about politics ; several major UK sites , such as Guido Fawkes and PoliticalBetting , focus either on rumour-mongering or cooler analysis . 
But the appeal of the form to those with something to get off their chests was clear . 
Posts could be made instantly , within minutes of news events taking place , and could be two or three lines long . 
There was no need to wait until one had enough material , and time , to assemble a newspaper column - although , for most of the bloggers I spoke to for this article , maintaining their sites seemed to absorb many hours . 
-LRB- The time had to be found where it could ; Oliver Kamm originally blogged in the middle of the night , when he found himself sitting up with his new children , and needed something to do . -RRB- 
There were other advantages . 
The old barriers to access - the need to get a job at a newspaper , or a slot on television - did n't exist . 
You did n't even need to put a name to your views . 
-LRB- David T and `` Harry '' , of Harry 's Place , insist on preserving their anonymity because they do not want to aggravate their employers . -RRB- 
Bloggers could link to other bloggers ' postings , to demonstrate their agreement or provide examples of views they despised . 
Later , many sites added the facility for readers to leave comments , often spawning debates that continued long after the bloggers themselves had moved on to other topics . 
-LRB- Amid the flourishing of all this online diversity , certain uniformities emerged . 
Opinionated political blogging frequently resembles a pub rant , and , as such , remains an overwhelmingly male pastime in the UK : Cronin , at Samizdata , and her much-read fellow libertarian Natalie Solent , are rare exceptions . -RRB- 
`` Mainstream media is operating in what I call a channel world , '' says Cronin , whose faith in the transformative power of blogs can sometimes resemble religious zeal . 
`` You 've got certain pipelines that are owned by somebody , and you 've got the content , which is packaged and delivered to the final eyeball . 
Blogs , though , are part of a network world . '' 
The power of blogs , according to this theory , lies not so much in the persuasive force of any one specific rhetorician , but in the opportunities for connections to be made . 
Hundreds of people can quickly `` swarm '' around a particular issue , adapting it to their own purposes . 
Harry 's Place was an important recruiter of canvassers on behalf of Oona King , and against George Galloway , at the last election , while the anti-war site Bloggerheads was instrumental in Backing Blair , a satirical campaign designed to reduce Labor 's 2005 majority via tactical voting . 
Online , power is the power of crowds ; celebrity becomes dissipated . 
`` On the internet , '' Cronin likes to say , `` everyone is famous for 15 people . '' 
As you step into Norman Geras 's home , in Manchester 's leafy suburbs , the words `` cutting-edge cyberphenomenon '' do n't immediately spring to mind ; in fact , they never really do , despite his being one of the country 's most influential political bloggers . 
The retired Manchester university professor of government lives with his wife , a children 's author , in a neatly furnished home , one room of which is densely shelved with books about cricket . 
`` There must be 2,500 of them , '' says Geras , who speaks quietly , with a southern African accent . 
`` Actually , who am I kidding ? 
I 'm quite particular about these things , and I 've counted them : I know there are 2,500 . '' 
Another bookshelf , by the front door , is filled with nothing but copies of the New Left Review ; Geras is a lifelong marxist who still describes himself as such . 
But he has also been a key online voice of the `` pro-war left '' - a position born , as for David T , of trying to resolve a serious case of psychological conflict in the months after 9\/11 . 
His site , Normblog , arose from a feeling of alienation `` from people I perceived as being in my neck of the woods '' , he says - academic colleagues , friends , and -LRB- a point made frequently by bloggers of Geras 's political persuasion -RRB- writers of articles in the comment pages of the liberal press , including this newspaper . 
`` The next day -LRB- after 9\/11 -RRB- , or the day after , I open the newspaper and see - within hours - people talking about ` blowback ' , ` comeuppance ' . 
They did n't even have the sense of horror , of shock , to wait . 
I was just appalled . 
I thought , ` That 's it . ' '' 
He has blogged every day since July 2003 , with only about seven exceptions , including two Christmases and a spell when he was traveling and could n't get to a computer . 
In fact , there were plentiful expressions of horror - but it is true that many columnists did not leave the matter there . 
`` It 's not that they do n't say , in a couple of lines at the beginning , that they 're outraged , '' Geras says . 
`` It 's a matter of balance and judgment . 
You can only judge on the overall balance of what 's said . '' 
However justified their sense that their views were being squeezed from mainstream liberal debate , the hawkish left began to flourish online . 
Its members diagnosed what they saw as an unholy alliance between the extremist fringe of Islam and elements of the `` hard left '' . 
A key function of sites such as Normblog became the forensic examination of the work of commentators who claimed to be explaining the reasons for the attacks , but who found themselves accused of trying to justify them . 
Other blogs set out to demolish offending articles by quoting them and then attacking them line by line - a practice that became known as `` fisking '' , a derogatory reference to the Independent writer Robert Fisk , a regular victim of the approach . 
`` Why is it , '' says Geras , `` that the people in our culture are genuine agents , who take criticism for what they do , whereas the terrorists , who come from wherever else , are always somehow effects of somebody else 's actions ? '' 
As the talk in Washington and London turned from Afghanistan to Iraq , many natural leftwingers who could not resolve mixed feelings about the coming war found themselves visiting Normblog . 
`` It was like a secret handshake - ` Do you read Norm ? ' '' 
is how one journalist puts it . 
How all these feelings metamorphosed into support for the war is harder to discern : it sometimes seemed as if the leftwing hawks , out of distaste for some aspects of the anti-war lobby , were propelled by magnetic repulsion to a default position of support for the war that did n't always ring true . 
Geras , for his part , supported it on the logic of humanitarian intervention . 
But does n't the catastrophic state of Baghdad prove that , in this instance at least , they made an error ? 
`` Even if I come to a point where I have to say it was a mistake - and I hope it does n't come to that , but it could happen , say if the whole thing degenerates into a terrible civil war , and even what we 've seen so far is overshadowed - that would be a different thing from saying that the reasons for supporting the war when it happened were wrong , '' Geras says . 
`` I genuinely thought intervention was unlikely to make things worse . 
A lot of antiwar critics say , ` You 're an idiot . 
It was obvious that it would . ' '' 
So - has it ? 
`` As of now , I would n't say that . 
As of now , there 's still a chance for a democratic future for Iraq . '' 
The July 7 bombings newly energised the `` pro-war left '' , leading to accusations - notably from Madeleine Bunting in this paper - that these `` muscular liberals '' are retreading the `` clash of civilisations '' thesis , giving voice to a kind of liberal fundamentalism as zealous as the religious fundamentalism it sets itself against . 
`` You can hear the creak of the drawbridge being pulled up , '' Bunting wrote . 
`` They believe they are surrounded by enemies - Muslims , and their dastardly non-Muslim apologists - and must defend to the last man the checklist of universal Enlightenment values that sustain their mission . 
Their most ferocious firepower is directed at former allies whom they regard as yet to see the light . '' 
Not everyone who becomes a political blogger means their blog to start out that way , but the urge frequently proves irresistible . 
`` It took less than a year , '' says Tim Ireland , who works in marketing and runs Bloggerheads , founded in 2002 . 
-LRB- He has designed blogs for the Labor MP Tom Watson and the Tory Boris Johnson . -RRB- 
By 2003 , Ireland was engaged in a half-serious campaign to force the prime minister to deliver on a promise to set up a publicly accessible email address . 
In brief , it involved an email address that looked similar to what Blair 's might be , which soon started receiving email intended for the PM . 
He also used the address to email MPs . 
Ten responded to his missive , which , among other things , invited suggestions for names for Blair 's new baby . 
`` I can say with complete confidence that I am the only reason Blair 's email facility was -LRB- eventually -RRB- developed , '' he says . 
The build-up to the Iraq war , though , added a steelier and angrier edge to Ireland 's campaigning . 
Partly because of the internet , he says , he was exposed to a far wider range of media sources than he might have been had he read a single newspaper , and he concluded that `` I had the facts on my side . 
Blair had to be held accountable , to be shown that to manipulate and exploit the ` war on terror ' for political gain was the wrong thing to do , morally and pragmatically ... eventually I just said , ` Fuck work . ' '' 
He made sure he looked after his existing clients , `` but the reason I 've been in politics more than marketing , really , is because there are people dying , and that outrages me . '' 
He channelled his outrage into Backing Blair , which used its ironically pro-Blair stance - its slogan was `` No Alternative '' - to urge tactical anti-Labour voting . 
Half a million people visited the site , he says , where they found themselves being urged to vote Tory if necessary . 
Was n't that an irresponsible thing to advocate , from a leftwing point of view ? 
`` No way were the Tories going to win , '' Ireland says . 
`` I would have bet my left testicle on it . '' 
Similar anti-Blair sentiments , meanwhile , were being wittily expressed by Justin McKeating of the Hove-based site Chicken Yoghurt . 
McKeating spent the run-up to the 2005 general election closely following , and blogging about , the campaign in his constituency , reporting on encounters with candidates and canvassers . 
It was a version of the `` citizen journalism '' increasingly prevalent in the US that only threw into relief how little of the same seemed to be going on among the British blogs . 
There are , of course , a thousand other shades of political viewpoint throughout the `` blogo-sphere '' - a word every blogger I spoke to in person grimaced when using , though nobody seemed to have an alternative . 
Conservatives can get their fix at two prominent blogs , Conservative Commentary and Blithering Bunny , while the UK Evangelical Blog , run by Adrian Warnock , also figures high in the charts . 
How much does it all really matter , though ? 
Britain 's bloggers are divided not just by ideology , it turns out , but by their perception of their own importance : while Samizdata proclaims that blogs are the future , for example , Oliver Kamm insists they are an essentially parasitic medium , that can only exist insofar as it feasts on the output of traditional media . 
But on the subject of motivation , the near-physical urge all the bloggers I spoke to felt - to join the debate , to make waves - seems to have been surprisingly uniform . 
`` I got sick of breaking televisions by throwing things at them , '' is how De Havilland puts it . 
`` If we lived in a world where actual facts could be discussed rationally , I 'd happily disappear back into my cage and sell tat for a living , '' says Tim Ireland . 
But the drive that he feels , he says , `` will not allow me to shut down until Blair is held accountable '' . 
`` Harry '' , of the eponymous Place , recently announced he would be giving up blogging , for work and family reasons , but David T says he does n't believe him . 
`` He says he 's given up , but he 'll be back , because blogs are like crack and you ca n't quite ever give it up , '' says David . 
Or not like crack , but pornography : `` The internet grew , as so many industries did , because of people 's desire furtively to find pornography , '' he points out . 
`` I sometimes think blogging is the political equivalent to that . '' 
He spends only a brief time writing his own blog entries , he says - but hours reading through readers ' comments . 
`` That sort of thing can ruin your marriage . 
You 're never cured - you 're only in remission .

2005-11-19,"Oliver Miles enjoys Robert Fisk 's flawed but fascinating survey of the Middle East in our time , The Great War for Civilisation Robert Fisk has lived as a journalist in the Middle East for nearly 30 years , half his lifetime . 
For 16 of those years he has chronicled `` the betrayals and treachery and deceit of Middle East history '' , nurturing this excessively long book - a real War and Peace , but with precious little peace . 
His philosophy is `` to challenge authority - all authority - especially so when governments and politicians take us to war '' . 
He quotes with approval the Israeli journalist Amira Hass : `` There is a misconception that journalists can be objective ... What journalism is really about is to monitor power and the centres of power . '' 
Fisk is perceived as anti-American , but scarcely any political leader escapes his lash . 
Praise is reserved for fellow-journalists - I counted 14 who are first-rate , brilliant , daring , meticulous , `` a blessing for journalism '' . 
His forte is straight reporting , such as his three interviews with Osama bin Laden . 
At least as good are his meetings with Saddam Hussein , Khomeini and Sadeq Khalkhali , the hanging judge of the Iranian revolution , and his close-ups of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , the launch of Saddam 's war against Iran , an ambush by Islamists of an Algerian police patrol , and a lift into trouble in an Apache attack helicopter on the Iraq\/Turkey border . 
Recounting his resignation from the Times , he hesitates : `` what is Fisk doing , I can hear hostile reviewers of this book ask - writing about the violent death of 290 innocent human beings and then taking up five pages to explain his petty rows with the Times ? '' 
For this reviewer , at least , the problem is the opposite : sharp-focus reporting is submerged as horror is piled on horror - massacres and torture , atrocities by Turks , Iranians and Iraqis , Palestinians slaughtered by Israelis and Israelis slaughtered by Palestinians , Americans by Arabs and Arabs by Americans . 
One example : five pages by Hussein Shahristani on being tortured in Iraq , reproduced verbatim because `` his story ... deserves to be told in full , in his own words '' . 
-LRB- He does not mention that in 2004 Shahristani was backed as prime minister of Iraq by the UN representative Lakhdar Brahimi , but sidelined by the Americans in favor of the US-based exile Iyad Allawi . -RRB- 
Fisk compares his themes to those of Goya and Hieronymus Bosch , but Goya painted the Naked Maja as well as his black paintings , and Bosch painted earthly delights as well as the nightmare of hell . 
That 's not Fisk . 
`` A fetid river -LRB- the Tigris -RRB- flowed slowly between treeless banks of gray sand beneath a dun-coloured sky . '' 
The Persian Gulf , nowadays a tourist destination , `` looks not unlike Mars '' . 
True enough , but Thesiger he is n't . 
Much more effective than reams of technicalities about the arms trade is the tale of tracing a missile used by the Israeli air force to murder civilians in Lebanon right back to the men in suits in Gainesville , Georgia , who manufactured it . 
At the final confrontation , after producing the missile fragment bearing the tell-tale code number , he pushes across the table photographs of the children who died , images of blood and torn limbs . 
`` The executive on my left looked through them with distaste . 
Then he said : ' I do n't want these . ' '' 
And even Fisk felt `` oddly sad '' for him . 
It 's worth quoting some penetrating insights . 
The word `` settlements '' for the illegal Israeli presence in the occupied territories is `` almost comforting '' - the right word , as Fisk says , is `` colonising '' . 
Every Palestinian knew that the four principal US officials handling the peace process for Washington in 1993 were Jews , and the Israeli press said so ; but the western press did not . 
Fisk does n't mention Tony Blair 's appointment of Lord Levy as his personal Middle East envoy ; some of the Arab leaders who meet Levy appear to be under the impression that he represents Sharon rather than Blair . 
Fisk describes how the French in the Algerian war of independence taught the Israelis their tactics . 
Forty years later `` the Pentagon sent a delegation to Israel to study Israeli army tactics during the Palestinian intifada , so they could adopt these lessons in their own battle with Iraqi insurgents ... In some derivative and unconscious way , the Americans in Iraq may thus have been copying - at second hand - France 's equally deplorable tactics in the Algerian war of independence . '' 
In the Kuwait war the allies ignored the Geneva Convention rules about enemy dead . 
General Schwarzkopf said he was `` not in the business of body counts '' . 
But as Fisk points out , `` even Hitler 's SS soldiers who were killed fighting the Americans around Bastogne in 1944 were identified and buried in marked graves '' . 
General Tommy Franks was to repeat Schwarzkopf 's one-liner about body counts in the Iraq war of 2003 , with Blair giving the unfortunate impression that he does n't care . 
`` Guantnamo was a mirror of the treatment that every Middle East dictatorship meted out to its opponents . 
Shackled , hooded , threatened with death by ` courts ' that would give no leeway to defense or innocence : this was how every Arab secret police force dealt with enemies of the regime . '' 
Many of the problems of the Middle East have their roots in the first world war , to which the book 's title is an allusion . 
Fisk tries to knit the whole book together round a chapter on his father and his experiences in the war , but it does n't really work . 
Worse , it leads to oversimplification of history : the `` extraordinary lenity '' shown by the Allies to Turkey after the war , or the Northern Ireland conflict , `` that legacy of British colonial rule '' . 
The book 's second title remains a mystery ; who has conquered the Middle East ? 
The book contains a deplorable number of mistakes . 
Some are amusing : my favorite is when King Hussein 's stallion unexpectedly `` reared up on her hind legs '' . 
Christ was born in Bethlehem , not Jerusalem . 
Napoleon 's army did not burn Moscow , the Russians did . 
French : meurt means dies , not blooms . 
Russian : goodbye is do svidanya , not dos vidanya . 
Farsi : laleh means tulip , not rose . 
Arabic : catastrophe is nakba not nakhba -LRB- which means elite -RRB- , and many more . 
Other mistakes undermine the reader 's confidence . 
Muhammad 's nephew Ali was murdered in the 7th century , not the 8th century . 
Baghdad was never an Ummayad city . 
The Hashemites are not a Gulf tribe but a Hijaz tribe , as far as you can get from the Gulf and still be in Arabia . 
The US forward base for the Kuwait war , Dhahran , is not `` scarcely 400 miles '' from Medina and the Muslim holy places , it is about 700 miles . 
Britain during the Palestine mandate did not support a Jewish state . 
The 1939 white paper on Palestine did not `` abandon Balfour 's promise '' -LRB- and he was not `` Lord Balfour '' when he made it -RRB- . 
The Iraq revolution of 1958 was not Baathist . 
Britain did not pour military hardware into Saddam 's Iraq for 15 years , or call for an uprising against Saddam in 1991 . 
These last two `` mistakes '' occasion lengthy Philippics against British policy ; others may deserve them , we do not . 
There are no illustrations in the text , but there is an end paper portrait of Bin Laden , looking benign but , oddly , a bit drunk . 
A great book is a great evil , wrote Callimachus . 
Vigilant editing and ruthless pruning could perhaps have made two or three good short books out of this one .

2005-11-21,"The hunt for Iraq 's lost treasure When thousands of antiquities were looted from Baghdad 's Iraq museum , US marine Matthew Bogdanos pledged to get them back . 
After two years of sleuthing , he has become a national hero . 
Julian Borger reports On April 15 , 2003 , in the Iraqi city of Basra , an enraged British journalist whose name has been lost to history stormed up to a US marine colonel and his men and denounced them as `` macho assholes '' . 
The colonel had been looking for weapons and cash left behind by the ousted Iraqi regime , but this reporter believed fiercely that he should be more concerned that `` the finest museum in the world has just been looted '' . 
By a peculiar turn of fate , she had stumbled on the one person in the whole of modern Mesopotamia who both cared deeply about the cultural calamity at Baghdad 's Iraq museum and possessed the expertise , determination and clout to do something about it . 
His name was Matthew Bogdanos - a Greek-American classics scholar and a New York prosecutor , whose toughness and tenacity had earned him the nickname `` pit bull '' even before he went off to fight the `` war on terror '' . 
Colonel Bogdanos can not remember the name of the reporter who vented her frustration at him , but she appears to have set off an extraordinary train of events . 
Five days after the encounter , he had overcome the objections of his superior officers and was at the gates of the Baghdad museum , heading a mixed bag of volunteer soldiers and investigators , ready to hunt down Iraq 's lost legacy . 
What followed over the next two years was an epic feat of wartime sleuthing which took Bogdanos along a trail from pitch-black underground chambers and submerged bank vaults in Baghdad to the sleek antiquity dealerships of Madison Avenue , in pursuit of lost treasures with Harry Potterish names , such as the Sacred Vase of Warka . 
Along the way , more than 5,000 artworks , including unique pieces from the first fluttering of civilisation , were recovered . 
Bogdanos left active duty in the marines last month , but he is still on the hunt for the thousands of objects still unaccounted for . 
When he returns to the Manhattan district attorney 's office , where he worked before the September 11 attacks , he has permission , he says , to set up a new arts and antiquities unit . 
The story so far is told in his new book , Thieves of Baghdad , the royalties from which will go back to the Iraq museum . 
It traces his path from poring over the Iliad while helping out at his father 's Greek restaurant as a boy , to prosecuting Puff Daddy in New York , to the turning point of September 11 . 
His apartment was a few hundred yards from the North Tower and his family was lucky to survive its collapse . 
As a marine reservist , he immediately volunteered for active duty and his investigative skills were rapidly put to use in Afghanistan , tracking down Taliban documents , including an all-important membership ledger . 
He followed the action to Iraq , his fateful meeting with the contemptuous British reporter and his present incarnation as a marine corps Indiana Jones . 
These days , Bogdanos is feted as a hero in Washington . 
Ten days ago , he was in the Oval Office where George Bush -LRB- `` appreciative and knowledgeable '' -RRB- awarded him the National Humanities Medal . 
All the acclaim notwithstanding , Bogdanos gives the impression of boiling with anger from the first hello . 
He launches into a tirade against media reports of the looting -LRB- including the Guardian 's account -RRB- which exaggerated the number of stolen objects , claiming 170,000 were missing . 
According to Bogdanos the figure was less than a tenth of that . 
And he is still infuriated by the suggestion that , as he puts it , `` Coalition forces stood idly by as looters ransacked the museum . '' 
That , he insists , `` is simply and undeniably factually inaccurate '' . 
Between April 10 and 12 2003 , when most of the thefts took place , Bogdanos says the museum was being used as a redoubt by Iraqi Special Republican Guard troops . 
`` It simply could not have been secured without a battle that would have been devastating , or blood loss that would have been criminal on the part of the commander on the ground , '' he says . 
On the other hand , and with an equal measure of outrage , Bogdanos holds the US forces responsible for taking four days to arrive at the museum after the management 's appeal for help on April 12 . 
`` It 's not sinister . 
It 's not evil . 
It 's inexcusable , '' he says . 
In those four days , he says , the museum 's Iraqi curators kept the thieves of Baghdad at bay themselves , but much of the damage had already been done . 
Half an hour into the interview , Bogdanos is still fighting mad , and it is clear that enraged bellowing is his default mode of communication . 
A truly accurate transcript of our interview would have to be entirely in capital letters , punctuated with multiple exclamation and question marks , and occasionally hyphenated to show where he slows down , as if instructing a raw teenage recruit . 
Is he always so hot under the collar ? 
`` Injustice always angers me , '' he replies . 
Bogdanos believes there were three classes of robber at work : looters who cleared museum shelves at random ; professionals who knew what they were looking for , perhaps taking orders from foreign dealers ; and inside operators - employees or ex-employees who knew where particular treasures were hidden , using the chaos of the war as a cover to grab them . 
The distinction between the second and third group is somewhat blurred , but Bogdanos presents compelling evidence that inside knowledge was involved . 
He followed the robbers ' footprints into an underground storage room that had been bricked off from the rest of the museum , where an acrid stench suggested they had had to work in darkness , burning improvised torches . 
Somehow the thieves had found their way to a hidden set of keys and used them to open lockers containing a unique collection of ancient cylindrical seals . 
By some fluke , however , the keys had been dropped halfway through the heist and the thieves had been unable to recover them in the smoke-filled murk . 
They fled before they found the collection of gold coins , which survives almost intact . 
Perhaps more surprising than the number of treasures stolen was the number brought back . 
One of the first steps decided upon , was when Bogdanos and the museum authorities declared an amnesty with no questions asked and a cup of tea for anything returned . 
The colonel and his men fanned out into the Baghdad bazaars and spread the word . 
Antiquities soon started turning up at the museum gates . 
One car delivered 94 artifacts . 
By the time Bogdanos left , 1,952 missing pieces had been handed back . 
`` There is n't one single reason for it , '' he says . 
`` You name it : fear of getting caught , conscience , recognition that they were no longer stealing from Hussein but stealing from themselves ... There are 1,952 reasons . '' 
The network of informants Bogdanos built up in the bazaar led his men to other finds . 
The Mask of Warka , a 3100BC limestone mask thought to be the earliest surviving naturalistic depiction of a human face , was found buried on a farm north of Baghdad . 
A precious statue was found wrapped and submerged in a septic tank . 
The most valuable pieces , however , are already likely to be tucked away in private collections in the US and Europe , but Bogdanos thinks there are still ways to get them back . 
`` If you are willing to spend $ 20 , $ 30 , $ 40m for a piece of alabaster with funny writing on it that you can never publicly acknowledge owning and never show off , the first thing you are going to want to know is if that piece is authentic , '' he says . 
`` Are you going to take the dealer 's word that it 's real ? 
Are you going to take a graduate student 's word for it ? 
No , you 're going to get the head of a department , the head of a museum or someone who is published in the field . '' 
So the focus of the hunt moves now from Baghdad to New York , where Bogdanos will set up his new investigative unit . 
Meanwhile , he is playing it cool , fielding offers from Hollywood for his story . 
Any film , he insists , would have to advance his central aim - getting the lost art back . 
`` If it 's going to be done in pure Indiana Jones style , then it 's not going to advance the ball . 
But if it 's going to be done seriously and intelligently , but as fun as well , then I 'm for it , '' he barks . 
`` I love movies . 
I loved Indiana Jones '' .

2005-11-22,"Behind the phosphorus clouds are war crimes within war crimes We now know the US also used thermobaric weapons in its assault on Falluja , where up to 50,000 civilians remained The media could n't have made a bigger pig 's ear of the white phosphorus story . 
So , before moving on to the new revelations from Falluja , I would like to try to clear up the old ones . 
There is no hard evidence that white phosphorus was used against civilians . 
The claim was made in a documentary broadcast on the Italian network RAI , called Falluja : the Hidden Massacre . 
It claimed that the corpses in the pictures it ran `` showed strange injuries , some burnt to the bone , others with skin hanging from their flesh ... The faces have literally melted away , just like other parts of the body . 
The clothes are strangely intact . '' 
These assertions were supported by a human-rights advocate who , it said , possessed `` a biology degree '' . 
I , too , possess a biology degree , and I am as well qualified to determine someone 's cause of death as I am to perform open-heart surgery . 
So I asked Chris Milroy , professor of forensic pathology at the University of Sheffield , to watch the film . 
He reported that `` nothing indicates to me that the bodies have been burnt '' . 
They had turned black and lost their skin `` through decomposition '' . 
We do n't yet know how these people died . 
But there is hard evidence that white phosphorus was deployed as a weapon against combatants in Falluja . 
As this column revealed last Tuesday , US infantry officers confessed that they had used it to flush out insurgents . 
A Pentagon spokesman told the BBC that white phosphorus `` was used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants '' . 
He claimed `` it is not a chemical weapon . 
They are not outlawed or illegal . '' 
This denial has been accepted by most of the mainstream media . 
UN conventions , the Times said , `` ban its use on civilian but not military targets '' . 
But the word `` civilian '' does not occur in the chemical weapons convention . 
The use of the toxic properties of a chemical as a weapon is illegal , whoever the target is . 
The Pentagon argues that white phosphorus burns people , rather than poisoning them , and is covered only by the protocol on incendiary weapons , which the US has not signed . 
But white phosphorus is both incendiary and toxic . 
The gas it produces attacks the mucous membranes , the eyes and the lungs . 
As Peter Kaiser of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons told the BBC last week : `` If ... the toxic properties of white phosphorus , the caustic properties , are specifically intended to be used as a weapon , that of course is prohibited , because ... any chemicals used against humans or animals that cause harm or death through the toxic properties of the chemical are considered chemical weapons . '' 
The US army knows that its use as a weapon is illegal . 
In the Battle Book , published by the US Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas , my correspondent David Traynier found the following sentence : `` It is against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets . '' 
Last night the blogger Gabriele Zamparini found a declassified document from the US department of defense , dated April 1991 , and titled `` Possible use of phosphorus chemical '' . 
`` During the brutal crackdown that followed the Kurdish uprising , '' it alleges , `` Iraqi forces loyal to President Saddam may have possibly used white phosphorus -LRB- WP -RRB- chemical weapons against Kurdish rebels and the populace in Erbil ... and Dohuk provinces , Iraq . 
The WP chemical was delivered by artillery rounds and helicopter gunships ... These reports of possible WP chemical weapon attacks spread quickly ... hundreds of thousands of Kurds fled from these two areas . '' 
The Pentagon is in no doubt , in other words , that white phosphorus is an illegal chemical weapon . 
The insurgents , of course , would be just as dead today if they were killed by other means . 
So does it matter if chemical weapons were mixed with other munitions ? 
Anyone who has seen those photos of the lines of blind veterans at the remembrance services for the first world war will surely understand the point of international law , and the dangers of undermining it . 
But we should n't forget that the use of chemical weapons was a war crime within a war crime within a war crime . 
Both the invasion of Iraq and the assault on Falluja were illegal acts of aggression . 
Before attacking the city , the marines stopped men `` of fighting age '' from leaving . 
Many women and children stayed : the Guardian 's correspondent estimated that between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians were left . 
The marines treated Falluja as if its only inhabitants were fighters . 
They levelled thousands of buildings , illegally denied access to the Iraqi Red Crescent and , according to the UN 's special rapporteur , used `` hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population '' . 
I have been reading accounts of the assault published in the Marine Corps Gazette . 
The soldiers appear to have believed everything the US government told them . 
One article claims that `` the absence of civilians meant the marines could employ blast weapons prior to entering houses that had become pillboxes , not homes '' . 
Another said that `` there were less than 500 civilians remaining in the city '' . 
It continued : `` The heroics -LRB- of the marines -RRB- will be the subject of many articles and books ... The real key to this tactical victory rested in the spirit of the warriors who courageously fought the battle . 
They deserve all of the credit for liberating Falluja . '' 
But buried in this hogwash is a grave revelation . 
An assault weapon the marines were using had been armed with warheads containing `` about 35 % thermobaric novel explosive -LRB- NE -RRB- and 65 % standard high explosive '' . 
They deployed it `` to cause the roof to collapse and crush the insurgents fortified inside interior rooms '' . 
It was used repeatedly : `` The expenditure of explosives clearing houses was enormous . '' 
The marines can scarcely deny that they know what these weapons do . 
An article published in the Gazette in 2000 details the effects of their use by the Russians in Grozny . 
Thermobaric , or `` fuel-air '' weapons , it says , form a cloud of volatile gases or finely powdered explosives . 
`` This cloud is then ignited and the subsequent fireball sears the surrounding area while consuming the oxygen in this area . 
The lack of oxygen creates an enormous overpressure ... Personnel under the cloud are literally crushed to death . 
Outside the cloud area , the blast wave travels at some 3,000 metres per second ... As a result , a fuel-air explosive can have the effect of a tactical nuclear weapon without residual radiation ... Those personnel caught directly under the aerosol cloud will die from the flame or overpressure . 
For those on the periphery of the strike , the injuries can be severe . 
Burns , broken bones , contusions from flying debris and blindness may result . 
Further , the crushing injuries from the overpressure can create air embolism within blood vessels , concussions , multiple internal hemorrhages in the liver and spleen , collapsed lungs , rupture of the eardrums and displacement of the eyes from their sockets . '' 
It is hard to see how you could use these weapons in Falluja without killing civilians . 
This looks to me like a convincing explanation of the damage done to Falluja , a city in which between 30,000 and 50,000 civilians might have been taking refuge . 
It could also explain the civilian casualties shown in the film . 
So the question has now widened : is there any crime the coalition forces have not committed in Iraq ?

2005-11-23,"See a gallery of Sean Smith 's Iraq pictures here US marines in the town of Ubaydi , as part of an ongoing offensive against insurgents in the North west of Iraq . 
Photograph : Sean Smith\/Guardian I was attached to squads from the 3rd Battalion\/Sixth Marines and 2nd Battalion\/First Marines as they moved into Iraqi towns along the border with Syria . 
The US said the aim of Operation Steel Curtain , which began two weeks ago and has now been completed , was to break up insurgent cells and disrupt their supply lines from Syria . 
The marines worked their way house by house through the border towns along the Euphrates . 
They had not been in the towns for at least a year and thought they would encounter a lot of insurgents on the first day . 
But they took only a little fire in Karabila and Husayba , from IEDs -LRB- improvised explosive devices -RRB- set off in the streets and hidden in walls . 
There was more resistance at Ubaydi in the following days . 
The US went in with tanks , Humvees , helicopters and planes . 
They swept from one end to the other , searching for weapons . 
They kicked in doors or used explosives to get in , or used tanks to do it . 
Humvees went in behind the troops with loudspeakers calling on people to leave . 
They encountered Iraqis with guns and rocket-propelled grenades . 
Two marines were killed , one of them going into a building . 
I heard it but did not realize what had happened until 20 minutes later . 
There was a group barricaded in a house and they waited for the soldier to come in and shot him . 
I saw the body of one of the men who killed him lying in the street . 
Five other marines were killed when they went to a farmhouse outside Ubaydi . 
They were chasing two men , went into the house , and it blew up . 
When people saw a ferocious assault was under way , they began to leave town . 
Women and children came out carrying white flags . 
It was eerie seeing columns of people appearing through the smoke and explosions , with no one knowing which direction the shooting was coming from . 
I am sure we will hear of more casualties . 
All men of military age were detained . 
they had material sprayed on their hands to reveal whether they had handled explosives or gunpowder . 
Families were split up and loudspeakers were barking commands . 
Some of the detainees came back and some did not . 
At Rawa the Iraqi army carried out searches , with US advisers . 
They did not arrest all males of military age , only those on a two-page list of suspects . 
They found about 3,000 lb of explosives . 
They took the detainees - about 20 - to a hill overlooking Rawa . 
There were a lot of mines so it took ages to get there . 
They were handcuffed all night , with their eyes bandaged . 
There was no room for everyone in the shelter so some slept outside . 
They were given a bottle of water and a blanket , then herded in the morning on to a helicopter and taken to the base at Qaim for questioning .

2005-11-23,"Wednesday 23 November 2005 13.58 GMT Claims that George Bush planned to bomb the Arabic TV news station al-Jazeera have fuelled concerns that an attack on the broadcaster 's Baghdad offices during the war on Iraq was deliberate . 
An international journalists group today demanded `` complete disclosure '' from the British and American governments over reports that the US considered attacking the al-Jazeera HQ in the Qatar capital , Doha . 
The International Federation of Journalists claimed that 16 journalists and other media staff have died at the hands of US forces in Iraq , adding that the deaths had not been properly investigated . 
Al-Jazeera cameraman Tarek Ayoub was killed when the station 's Baghdad office was bombed during a US air raid on April 8 2003 . 
On the same day a US tank shelled the Palestine hotel in the Iraqi capital , killing two other journalists . 
`` Reports that George Bush and Tony Blair discussed a plan to bomb al-Jazeera reinforce concerns that the US attack in Baghdad on April 8 -LRB- 2003 -RRB- was deliberate targeting of the media , '' said Aidan White , the general secretary of the IFJ . 
`` If that is the case then the US is guilty of a gross violation of international humanitarian law and on the face of it the murder of an innocent journalist . 
`` The evidence is stacking up to suggest that the US decided to take out al-Jazeera in Baghdad , as a warning not only to them but to other media about their coverage . 
If true , it is an absolute scandal that the US administration can regard the staff of al-Jazeera as a bunch of terrorists and a legitimate target . '' 
Under the front page headline `` Bush plots to bomb his ally '' , the Daily Mirror claimed yesterday a leaked memo revealed that the US president last year discussed plans to attack al-Jazeera 's Qatar HQ with Mr Blair . 
The Baghdad bombing of 2003 was the second attack by American forces on the offices of al-Jazeera . 
In 2001 the station 's Kabul office was hit by two `` smart '' bombs in an attack that almost wrecked the nearby BBC bureau . 
Al-Jazeera said it had given the location of its offices in both Kabul and Baghdad to the authorities in Washington , but it had still been attacked . 
`` We have been campaigning vigorously for an independent inquiry into what happened in Baghdad on April 8 -LRB- 2003 -RRB- . 
Now is the time for the US to take responsibility and tell the world what actually happened , '' said Mr White . 
`` The public has a right to know whether politicians would seriously consider killing journalists in order to stifle independent or critical voices . 
In this particular case the family , friends and colleagues of the victim also have a right to justice . 
`` Incidents in which journalists are killed by combatants in conflict zones have to be properly and independently investigated . 
Investigations that are carried out by the military do not consider the full extent of the evidence and in almost every single case lead to the exoneration of the military involved . 
At best there is a shrug of regret about the consequences . '' 
Both the US and UK governments declined to comment on the Mirror 's allegations . 
`` We are not going to dignify something so outlandish with a response , '' a White House official said . 
A Downing Street spokesman added : `` We have got nothing to say about this story . 
We do n't comment on leaked documents . '' 
The attorney general last night threatened newspapers with the Official Secrets Act if they revealed the contents of a document allegedly relating to a dispute between Mr Blair and Mr Bush over the conduct of military operations in Iraq .

2005-11-23,"Is talk of withdrawal premature ? 
Does a `` phased withdrawal '' from Iraq in 2006 really herald the beginning of the end for the coalition effort in Iraq ? 
An Oxford Research Group report released today suggests policy makers in Washington DC and London are being wildly over-optimistic about an exit strategy and concludes the Iraq war could last decades . 
Photograph : Martin Argles Does a `` phased withdrawal '' from Iraq in 2006 really herald the beginning of the end for the coalition effort in Iraq ? 
An Oxford Research Group report released today suggests policy makers in Washington DC and London are being wildly over-optimistic about an exit strategy and concludes the Iraq war could last decades . 
The best-case scenario for the coalition goes like this . 
After elections for a new national government in Baghdad in three weeks ' time the coalition can start to publicly name dates , along with specific numbers of troops to leave . 
With the Iraqi police becoming better trained each day , it should soon be able to take more control over day-to-day security thus reducing the current raison d'tre for the presence of western forces . 
Pictures of US troops boarding military planes and US tanks crossing back into Kuwait all live on Al-Jazeera , will gradually draw the poison fuelling the insurgency . 
It also gives the new government something to show to nationalists of all kinds within Iraq . 
The Pentagon has already started to put out briefings that its overall force will be cut by a third next year , with three brigades to leave early in the New Year , as an immediate payback for Iraqi voters . 
The UK too has indicated it will reduce its force in southern Iraq in the coming year . 
As the Guardian reported last week , talks have taken place between British and Iraqi officials about reducing troop numbers next May . 
With elections on December 15 allowing Tony Blair to hail the introduction of democracy , a joint UK-Iraqi statement is expected about British withdrawal . 
If the first phased reduction goes well and the insurgency begins to decline , the end of the occupation can then be planned sometime in the middle of next year in time for George Bush to present to voters ahead of next autumn 's mid-term congressional elections . 
Professor Paul Rogers casts serious doubt on this rosy scenario today . 
He argues in the Oxford Research Group paper , Iraq and the War on Terror , that occupation of Iraq is a `` gift '' to the al-Qaida movement . 
Not only is the occupation a powerful magnet for young jihadists seeking combat experience , it 's a powerful propaganda tool for their belief in a Christian crusader\/Zionist plot against Islam . 
Given their dependence on oil , a US withdrawal in the face of such terrorism would , he concludes , be a strategic catastrophe larger than the retreat from Vietnam . 
Since the al-Qaida movement measures its struggle in decades , not years , Prof Rogers believes that maintaining a friendly government in Baghdad will require the US military to stay for decades . 
He argues a UK withdrawal in the south is similarly difficult because it would mean handing over military power to pro-Iranian forces which would result in a break with Washington .

2005-11-23,"Wednesday 23 November 2005 10.47 GMT Arabic TV news channel al-Jazeera has called on the US and UK governments to provide a `` good explanation '' for comments allegedly made by George Bush about a plan to bomb its Qatar headquarters . 
The comments , which surfaced in a leaked memo , alleged that the American president considered bombing al-Jazeera 's offices in Doha , the capital of Qatar , at the height of last year 's Iraqi insurgency in Falluja . 
Al-Jazeera said it was still investigating the validity of the memo and whether Mr Bush was serious about his alleged comments or not , but warned that if they were credible it was a `` bad day '' for news organizations worldwide . 
`` We are still investigating the credibility and the contents of the document and in the absence of comment from Downing Street we are slightly cautious , '' said al-Jazeera 's London bureau chief , Yofri Fouda . 
`` We certainly hope it 's not true , but if it turns out to be true it would be horrific and bad news not only for al-Jazeera but for every news organization around the world . 
`` We hope Downing Street or the White House comes up with a good explanation - either denying the memo exists or , if it is true , that the president was at least joking . '' 
Mr Fouda said if details about the alleged memo - covered in a story in yesterday 's Daily Mirror - were correct , it would throw into question US explanations about attacks on al-Jazeera 's offices in Kabul and Baghdad in 2001 and 2003 . 
`` It will cast even more doubt on the circumstances surrounding previous incidents , '' he said . 
The channel 's London bureau chief said al-Jazeera wrote to the Pentagon at the start of the 2003 Iraq war detailing the locations of its offices in an official letter . 
`` Our Doha office is a one-storey building located in the middle of nowhere . 
It would be incredibly easy to knock out , '' he added . 
Both the US and UK government 's declined to comment on the allegations . 
`` We are not going to dignify something so outlandish with a response , '' a White House official said . 
A Downing Street spokesman said : `` We have got nothing to say about this story . 
We do n't comment on leaked documents . '' 
The alleged threat by Mr Bush to take `` military action '' against the broadcaster 's Qatar headquarters was contained in a leaked memo , which surfaced in the Daily Mirror yesterday . 
Quoting unnamed sources , the paper claimed the US president was `` deadly serious '' about the plan , which he allegedly talked about at a face-to-face meeting withTony Blair in April last year , but backed down after pressure from the UK prime minister . 
The US has long criticised al-Jazeera . 
During the Iraq war of 2003 , the US defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , accused the broadcaster of `` consistently lying '' and `` working in concert with terrorists '' .

2005-11-23,"The attorney general last night threatened newspapers with the Official Secrets Act if they revealed the contents of a document allegedly relating to a dispute between Tony Blair and George Bush over the conduct of military operations in Iraq . 
It is believed to be the first time the Blair government has threatened newspapers in this way . 
Though it has obtained court injunctions against newspapers , the government has never prosecuted editors for publishing the contents of leaked documents , including highly sensitive ones about the run-up to the invasion of Iraq . 
The attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , last night referred editors to newspaper reports yesterday that described the contents of a memo purporting to be at the center of charges against two men under the secrets act . 
Under the front-page headline `` Bush plot to bomb his ally '' , the Daily Mirror reported that the US president last year planned to attack the Arabic television station al-Jazeera , which has its headquarters in Doha , the capital of Qatar , where US and British bombers were based . 
Richard Wallace , editor of the Daily Mirror , said last night : `` We made No 10 fully aware of the intention to publish and were given ` no comment ' officially or unofficially . 
Suddenly 24 hours later we are threatened under section 5 -LRB- of the secrets act -RRB- '' . 
Under section 5 it is an offence to have come into the possession of government information , or a document from a crown servant , if that person discloses it without lawful authority . 
The prosecution has to prove the disclosure was damaging . 
The Mirror said the memo turned up in May last year at the constituency office of the former Labor MP for Northampton South , Tony Clarke . 
Last week , Leo O'Connor , a former researcher for Mr Clarke , was charged with receiving a document under section 5 of the act . 
David Keogh , a former Foreign Office official seconded to the Cabinet Office , was charged last week with making a `` damaging disclosure of a document relating to international relations '' . 
Mr Keogh , 49 , is accused of sending the document to Mr O'Connor , 42 , between April 16 and May 28 2004 . 
Mr Clarke said yesterday that Mr O'Connor `` did the right thing '' by drawing the document to his attention . 
Mr Clarke , an anti-war MP who lost his seat at the last election , returned the document to the government . 
`` As well as an MP , I am a special constable , '' he said . 
Both men were released on police bail last Thursday to appear at Bow Street magistrates court on November 29 . 
When they were charged , newspapers reported that the memo contained a transcript of a discussion between Mr Blair and Mr Bush . 
The conversation was understood to have taken place during a meeting in the US . 
It is believed to reveal that Mr Blair disagreed with Mr Bush about aspects of the Iraq war . 
There was widespread comment at the time that the British government was angry about US military tactics there , particularly in the city of Falluja . 
Charges under the secrets act have to have the consent of the attorney-general . 
His intervention yesterday suggests that the prosecution plans to ask the judge to hold part , if not all of the trial , in camera , with the public and press excluded . 
"
2005-11-27,"The leak that revealed Bush 's deep obsession with al-Jazeera The US president planned to bomb the Qatar-based channel - that was the remarkable claim made in a top-secret memo . 
Why is the world 's most powerful man so worried about a TV station ? 
Sunday 27 November 2005 02.10 GMT It was an ambush . 
As Britain woke up yesterday morning to snowstorms and arctic temperatures , the Attorney General was preparing to be questioned on Radio Four 's Today program over government plans to scrap jury trials in complex fraud cases . 
Instead , as the interview with John Humphrys ground to an end shortly after 8.30 am , the urbane Lord Goldsmith found himself explaining why he had warned national newspapers not to reveal the contents of a top secret memo detailing a lengthy conversation between the Prime Minister and President George Bush over the direction of the war in Iraq . ' 
I was n't seeking to gag newspapers ; what I said to newspapers was you need to take legal advice , ' Goldsmith insisted as an increasingly irritable Humphrys accused him of trying to silence the media for political expediency . 
` It is not being used to save the embarrassment of a politician , ' Goldsmith persevered . 
` That is completely not the case at all . ' 
It is unlikely this will be the last time Goldsmith will be asked about the memo , which first emerged in the offices of a little known Northamptonshire MP in June last year , and has metamorphosed into a major diplomatic incident . 
The status of the now infamous five-page document concerning the meeting between Bush and Blair , on 16 April last year , has already reached mythic proportions among bloggers on the internet . 
It is the smoking gun to end all smoking guns , claim conspiracy theorists , who believe it details everything from an agreed date to pull the troops out , to plans to take the one-time rebel stronghold of Fallujah . 
The one indisputable fact , though , is that part of the memo - 10 lines to be precise - concerns a conversation between Bush and Blair regarding Al Jazeera , the Arabic satellite television station that the US accuses of being a mouthpiece for al-Qaeda . 
According to those familiar with the memo 's contents , Bush floated the idea of bombing the Qatar-based station . 
The Daily Mirror , which ran the story last Tuesday , claimed the Prime Minister talked Bush out of the plan . 
As they attempted damage limitation last week , government officials suggested Bush 's comments were nothing more than a joke . 
It was preposterous to suggest Bush would countenance such an idea , the officials said . 
The White House described the allegations as ` unfathomable ' although according to those who have seen the memo ` there is no question Bush was serious . ' 
But whether said in jest or not , the memo reveals Bush 's profound obsession with Al Jazeera , an obsession that stretches from stucco-clad government offices in Washington to the tin huts located behind the razor wire in Guantanamo Bay . 
Why is the most powerful man in the world worried about a 24-hour news organization ? 
Salah Hassan , an Al Jazeera camerman , was arrested by US forces in November 2003 , while filming the aftermath of an attack on a US convoy near the city of Baquba . 
Following his arrest he was surprised to discover he had been trailed by US troops for weeks and had been secretly photographed at the scene of other attacks . 
When he was interrogated , he was accused of having prior knowledge of attacks on coalition forces . 
At the heart of the accusation is the fundamental tension between journalists - largely Arab reporters catering for an Arab audience - who say they are anxious to cover the story from both sides , and a United States that regards reporting on some aspects of the insurgency as tantamount to collaboration with terrorism . 
None of which would matter much were into not for the ferocious tenacity and professionalism of Al Jazeera , factors which have made the station an international phenomenon . 
Most gallingly for the US , its reporters have told a story that Washington either disagrees with or would rather remain untold : that the kind of war America is prosecuting in Iraq is messy and heavy handed ; that civilians are too often the victims , and that the insurgents are not shadowy sinister figures but ordinary men with more support than politicians would like to acknowledge . 
As a result Al Jazeera has seen itself under almost constant attack by a White House whose instinct has been to control the media since the war in Afghanistan . 
The US military has harassed its reporters . 
Its offices in Baghdad and Kabul have both been bombed by the US and reporters have been detained , threatened and abused . 
The reason , perhaps , is not so difficult to fathom . 
In the aftermath of the 9\/11 attacks , the station , which now enjoys a viewership of some 50 million , began broadcasting a series of messages from Osama bin Laden . 
It was a remarkable scoop , but one for which the station would pay heavy consequences , convincing the US that Al Jazeera was , at the very least , infiltrated by Al Qaeda . 
Was bin Laden using the broadcasts to send secret messages to his followers ? 
By the April of 2004 - and the first battle of Fallujah - US official loathing of the channel had reached a tipping point . 
Its focus was the figure of Ahmed Mansour , who reported from the city . 
According to Sami Muhyideen al-Hajj , an Al Jazeera camerman arrested in Afgahnistan in 2001 and detained in Guantanamo Bay , US interrogators are obsessed with the idea of Al Qaeda infiltration of the channel and asked about Mansour over 100 times . 
On separate occasions the reporter and producer has been accused of membership of the radical Muslim Brotherhood -LRB- which he denies -RRB- and forming ` improper ' relationships with mujahedeen leaders when he covered the Russian wars in Afghanistan and Chechnya . ' 
I do n't know why they would ask about me over a hundred times , ' Mansour told The Observer last week . 
` But the American authorities did not hide their extreme annoyance and fury as a result of my coverage of the first Fallujah campaign in April of 2004 . 
My sole crime was broadcasting the reality of a war I was witnessing . ' 
Mansour has become something of a cause celebre , lionised almost as much in the West as he is the Middle East . 
And the fact remains , despite the plethora of accusations against Al Jazeera by its political enemies , so far only one case of Al Qaeda collaboration has been brought to court - that of Taysir Allouni in Spain . 
A celebrated war correspondent who has interviewed bin Laden , Allouni was jailed for seven years after being cleared of the main charges in a case some claim was more political than evidential . 
It was a Friday afternoon in early June last year when a five-page document lying in his pigeon-hole in his constituency office caught the attention of Tony Clarke , the then Labor MP for Northampton South . 
It was immediately clear to him this was no ordinary party political memo . 
As he began to read the document , it became apparent it contained extraordinary details of a discussion between the British Prime Minister and the US President during Tony Blair 's visit to the White House the previous April . 
Written by a Blair aide who accompanied the Prime Minister to Washington it was headed ` top secret ' . 
It is understood that on the five pages there were details of troop deployments and movements . 
Lurking within the pages were also frank discussions over the US assault on Fallujah . 
It was clear from the tone of the memo that Blair was far from happy at the tactics used by American forces . 
Then , within a few short lines , came the bombshell : documentary evidence the US president had openly talked about bombing Al Jazeera . 
Clarke , who had voted against military intervention in Iraq believed he had no choice but to call Downing Street and reveal what he had been sent . 
The next day officers from Special Branch interviewed him at his home . 
Clarke 's trusted 42-year-old political researcher , Leo O'Connor , was also questioned . 
Detectives investigating the leak searched Clarke 's offices in the House of Commons . 
It was not long before they had set their sights on the potential leaker as David Keogh , a 49-year old civil servant who had been seconded from the Foreign Office to the Cabinet Office . 
Keogh lives alone in Northampton , not far from O'Connor , and was a member of the Labor Party and an occasional member of a dining club that Clarke and other senior members of the local Labor Party attended . 
He was arrested on 1 September last year and 10 days ago was charged with sending the document to O'Connor some time between 16 April and 28 May 2004 in breach of the Official Secrets Act . 
O'Connor , in turn , has been charged with receiving the document under section 5 of the Official Secrets Act . 
Details of the Foreign Office 's deep misgivings over the way the US was prosecuting the war had already been reported on 23 May last year in the Sunday Times , which had obtained another leaked document . 
Back then there was no desire by the Attorney General to pick a fight with Fleet Street and threaten it with the Official Secrets Act . 
Some suspect the difference this time is down to the fact the Al-Jazeera memo has deeply embarrassed the Bush administration . 
Keogh and O'Connor are due to appear at Bow Street magistrates ' court , south west London , this Tuesday . 
This initial hearing is likely to be held behind closed doors while the defense and prosecution teams fire their opening salvos . 
Crucial to the case will be whether the judge believes any of the case can be heard in public . 
Legal experts draw comparisons with the case of Katherine Gunn , the former GCHQ employee who alerted the world to the United Nations bugging scandal . 
The case against Gunn collapsed over fears British intelligence secrets would be revealed in open court and lead to questions over the legality of the war . 
The conclusion must be the government 's legal advisers believe it wo n't be forced into such a humiliating climbdown when the case goes to court . 
This time around the government is n't going to blink . 
An arab rival to the BBC The television station was set up in 1996 with $ 150 million from the Emir of Qatar . 
It was accused of being al-Qaeda 's mouthpiece when it broadcast a message from Osama bin Laden praising the 9\/11 hijackers . 
Many Muslim viewers criticise it for being too pro-Western and giving airtime to Israeli officials . 
It now rivals the BBC , with a worldwide audience of 50 million .

2005-11-27,"Allawi in damning indictment of new regime Bush prepares way for US troop pull-out Human rights abuses in Iraq are now as bad as they were under Saddam Hussein and are even in danger of eclipsing his record , according to the country 's first Prime Minister after the fall of Saddam 's regime . 
` People are doing the same as -LRB- in -RRB- Saddam 's time and worse , ' Ayad Allawi told The Observer . 
` It is an appropriate comparison . 
People are remembering the days of Saddam . 
These were the precise reasons that we fought Saddam and now we are seeing the same things . ' 
In a damning and wide-ranging indictment of Iraq 's escalating human rights catastrophe , Allawi accused fellow Shias in the government of being responsible for death squads and secret torture centres . 
The brutality of elements in the new security forces rivals that of Saddam 's secret police , he said . 
Allawi , who was a strong ally of the US-led coalition forces and was prime minister until this April , made his remarks as further hints emerged yesterday that President George Bush is planning to withdraw up to 40,000 US troops from the country next year , when Iraqi forces will be capable of taking over . 
Allawi 's bleak assessment is likely to undermine any attempt to suggest that conditions in Iraq are markedly improving . 
` We are hearing about secret police , secret bunkers where people are being interrogated , ' he added . ' 
A lot of Iraqis are being tortured or killed in the course of interrogations . 
We are even witnessing Sharia courts based on Islamic law that are trying people and executing them . ' 
He said that immediate action was needed to dismantle militias that continue to operate with impunity . 
If nothing is done , ` the disease infecting -LRB- the Ministry of the Interior -RRB- will become contagious and spread to all ministries and structures of Iraq 's government ' , he said . 
In a chilling warning to the West over the danger of leaving behind a disintegrating Iraq , Allawi added : ` Iraq is the centrepiece of this region . 
If things go wrong , neither Europe nor the US will be safe . ' 
His uncompromising comments came on the eve of Saddam 's latest court appearance on charges of crimes against humanity . 
They seem certain to fuel the growing sense of crisis over Iraq , both in the country itself and in the US , where political support for the occupation continues to plummet . 
Allawi was selected to serve as prime minister of the first interim government , before last January 's first national elections . 
Admired in both Downing Street and the White House as a non-sectarian politician committed to strong centralised government representing all Iraqis , Allawi 's supporters struggled in last January 's elections , where they were eclipsed by Shia religious parties , some of which have been implicated in the violence . 
Recently , however , his reputation has enjoyed a resurgence as he has tried to build alliances with Sunni political groups ahead of next month 's national elections . 
His comments come as a blow to those hoping that Iraq was moving towards normalisation under the new government . 
In a speech on Wednesday , Bush is expected to hail the improved readiness of Iraqi troops , which he has identified as the key condition for withdrawing US forces . 
But the proximity of the latest round of elections appears to have only intensified political murders and intimidations , including members of Allawi 's own list , who have been killed and attacked by political rivals . 
Despite denials of wrongdoing by the Ministry of the Interior , which has been implicated in much of the abuse , a series of damaging disclosures , including the discovery of a secret detention center run by the ministry , has heaped embarrassment on the Iraqi government and its foreign supporters . 
The intervention by one of Iraq 's most prominent political figures promises to turn human rights abuses into a key election issue . 
Allawi 's scathing assessment of the collapse of human rights in Iraq under the country 's first democratically elected government came amid an angry denunciation of the involvement of the Iraq government 's institutions in widespread disappearances , torture and assassinations . 
He added that he now had so little faith in the rule of law that he had instructed his own bodyguards to fire on any police car that attempted to approach his headquarters without prior notice , following the implication of police units in many of the abuses . 
Allawi saved his strongest condemnation for the Ministry of the Interior , whose personnel have been accused of being behind much of the abuse : ` The Ministry of the Interior is at the heart of the matter . 
I am not blaming the minister -LRB- Bayan Jabr -RRB- himself , but the rank and file are behind the secret dungeons and some of the executions that are taking place . ' 
Responding to the former prime minister 's comments , Sir Menzies Campbell , the Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman , said : ` It is inconceivable in the higher reaches of the command of the multinational forces that there was not an awareness of what is being done by some Iraqis to their own countrymen . 
` The assertions by Mr Allawi simply underline the catastrophic failure to have a proper strategy in place for the post-war period in Iraq . '

2005-11-28,"When secrecy does more harm than good The government is wrong to wield the Official Secrets Act over the leaked al-Jazeera memo In 1997 , the new Labor government published a white paper setting out its proposals for a Freedom of Information Act . 
The opening paragraph stated : `` Unnecessary secrecy in government leads to arrogance in governance and defective decision-making . 
The perception of excessive secrecy has become a corrosive influence in the decline of public confidence in government . 
Moreover , the climate of public opinion has changed : people expect much greater openness and accountability from government than they used to . '' 
So , when the Daily Mirror last week published a report , `` Bush plot to bomb his Arab ally '' , which told of a leaked government memo alleging that George Bush planned to bomb al-Jazeera 's headquarters in Qatar , did the government welcome the openness that such scrutiny could bring ? 
Instead the attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , tried to coerce editors into keeping quiet . 
The memo is said to describe an alleged conversation between Bush and Tony Blair last April , when Bush apparently threatened to use `` military action '' against al-Jazeera . 
The government could have tried to sue the Daily Mirror for breach of confidence . 
However , the newspaper would surely have had a cast-iron public interest defense , so the government chose instead to rely upon the Official Secrets Act . 
Under section 3 of the OSA , a crown servant is guilty of a criminal offence if he or she makes a damaging disclosure relating to international relations without lawful authority , where they came by that information because of their position in government . 
Also , under section 5 , a person who receives such information from such a person is guilty of a criminal offence if he or she then discloses it knowing it is protected under the OSA . 
A disclosure is held to be `` damaging '' if it is likely to endanger the interests of the UK abroad , seriously endanger the protection by the UK of those interests or the safety of British citizens abroad . 
According to the Daily Mirror report , the memo turned up in the office of the former Labor MP for Northampton South , Tony Clarke . 
A civil servant has been charged under section 3 , and a researcher for Clarke under section 5 , in relation to the leaked memo . 
But also , Lord Goldsmith is threatening newspaper editors under section 5 if they publish its contents . 
Clearly , there is a need for secrecy in relation to genuinely sensitive information which could endanger the UK 's national security or British citizens ' lives . 
However , the information apparently contained in this memo clearly raises questions of public interest . 
For example , whether George Bush was seriously recommending that a news organization located in a US ally 's territory be bombed in order to stop unfavourable coverage of the Iraq war . 
One wonders whether the prosecutions have more to do with political expediency than a genuine attempt to safeguard the national interest . 
Indeed , it could be suggested that the lack of openness of the government in this case does more harm to national security than good . 
This potential conflict has been recognized by the courts as long ago as the Spycatcher case in the late 1980s . 
More recently , Lord Bingham in the David Shayler case stated : `` There can be no government by the people if they are ignorant of the issues to be resolved , the arguments for and against different solutions and the facts underlying those arguments . '' 
The House of Lords in that case held that there was no public interest defense available under the OSA for members and former members of the security services , but one would expect the strictest restrictions to be imposed on security services personnel . 
The media are in a different position and thus a public interest defense may apply when journalists are alleged to breach the OSA . 
For , as the government itself noted , without openness and accountability , the public confidence will disappear .

2005-11-29,"After what has been described as the most foolish war in over 2,000 years , is there a way out of Iraq for President Bush , asks Brian Whitaker Tuesday 29 November 2005 13.54 GMT There is a remarkable article in the latest issue of the American Jewish weekly , Forward . 
It calls for President Bush to be impeached and put on trial `` for misleading the American people , and launching the most foolish war since Emperor Augustus in 9 BC sent his legions into Germany and lost them '' . 
To describe Iraq as the most foolish war of the last 2,014 years is a sweeping statement , but the writer is well qualified to know . 
He is Martin van Creveld , a professor at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and one of the world 's foremost military historians . 
Several of his books have influenced modern military theory and he is the only non-American author on the US Army 's list of required reading for officers . 
Professor van Creveld has previously drawn parallels between Iraq and Vietnam , and pointed out that almost all countries that have tried to fight similar wars during the last 60 years or so have ended up losing . 
Why President Bush `` nevertheless decided to go to war escapes me and will no doubt preoccupy historians to come , '' he told one interviewer . 
The professor 's puzzlement is understandable . 
More than two years after the war began , and despite the huge financial and human cost , it is difficult to see any real benefits . 
The weapons of mass destruction that provided the excuse for the invasion turned out not to exist and the idea that Iraq could become a beacon of democracy for the Middle East has proved equally far-fetched . 
True , there is now a multi-party electoral system , but it has institutionalised and consolidated the country 's ethnic , sectarian and tribal divisions - exactly the sort of thing that should be avoided when attempting to democratise . 
In the absence of anything more positive , Tony Blair has fallen back on the claim that at least we 're better off now without Saddam Hussein . 
That , too , sounds increasingly hollow . 
The fall of Saddam has brought the rise of Zarqawi and his ilk , levels of corruption in Iraq seem as bad as ever , and at the weekend former prime minister Iyad Allawi caused a stir by asserting that the human rights are no better protected now than under the rule of Saddam . 
Noting that some two-thirds of Americans believe the war was a mistake , van Creveld says in his article that the US should forget about saving face and pull its troops out : `` What had to come , has come . 
The question is no longer if American forces will be withdrawn , but how soon - and at what cost . '' 
Welcome as a pullout might be to many Americans , it would be a hugely complex operation . 
Van Creveld says it would probably take several months and result in sizeable casualties . 
More significantly , though , it would not end the conflict . 
`` As the pullout proceeds , '' he warns , `` Iraq almost certainly will sink into an all-out civil war from which it will take the country a long time to emerge - if , indeed , it can do so at all . 
All this is inevitable and will take place whether George W Bush , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice like it or not . '' 
This is one of the major differences between Iraq and the withdrawal from Vietnam . 
In Vietnam , it took place under a smokescreen of `` Vietnamisation '' in which US troops handed control to local forces in the south . 
Of course , it was a fairly thin smokescreen ; many people were aware at the time that these southern forces could not hold out and in due course the North Vietnamese overran the south , finally bringing the war to an end . 
Officially , a similar process is under way in Iraq , with the Americans saying they will eventually hand over to the new Iraqi army - though the chances of that succeeding look even bleaker than they did in Vietnam . 
`` The new Iraqi army is by all accounts much weaker , less skilled , less cohesive and less loyal to its government than even the South Vietnamese army was , '' van Creveld writes . 
Worse still , in Iraq there is no equivalent of the North Vietnamese regime poised to take power . 
What will happen once the Americans have gone is anyone 's guess , but a sudden outbreak of peace seems the remotest of all the possibilities . 
Not surprisingly , many who in principle would argue that the Americans had no right to invade Iraq in the first place are apprehensive about what might happen once they leave . 
The conference organised by the Arab League in Cairo last week was one example : it called for `` the withdrawal of foreign forces according to a timetable '' but did n't venture to suggest what that timetable might be . 
With or without American troops , the war in Iraq has acquired a momentum of its own and threatens to spill over into other parts of the region . 
There are four major issues : terrorism , Sunni-Shia rivalries , Kurdish aspirations , and the question of Iraq 's territorial integrity - all of which pose dangers internationally . 
Back in July 2003 , terrorism in Iraq seemed a manageable problem and President Bush boldly challenged the militants to `` bring 'em on '' . 
American forces , he said , were `` plenty tough '' and would deal with anyone who attacked them . 
There were others in the US who talked of the `` flypaper theory '' - an idea that terrorists from around the world could be attracted to Iraq and then eliminated . 
Well , the first part of the flypaper theory seems to work , but not the second . 
As with the Afghan war in the 1980s that spawned al-Qaida , there is every reason to suppose that the Iraq war will create a new generation of terrorists with expertise that can be used to plague other parts of the world for decades to come . 
The recent hotel bombings in Jordan are one indication of the way it 's heading . 
Contrary to American intentions , the war has also greatly increased the influence of Iran - a founder-member of Bush 's `` Axis of Evil '' - and opened up long-suppressed rivalries between Sunni and Shia Muslims . 
The impact of this can not be confined to Iraq and will eventually be felt in the oil-rich Sunni Gulf states -LRB- including Saudi Arabia -RRB- that have sizeable but marginalised Shia communities . 
Kurdish aspirations have been awakened too - which has implications for Turkey , Syria and Iran , especially if Iraq is eventually dismembered . 
With a fragile central government in Baghdad constantly undermined by the activities of militants and weakened by the conflicting demands of Sunnis , Shias and Kurds , the demise of Iraq as a nation-state sometime during the next few years has become a distinct possibility . 
The effect of that on the regional power balance is difficult to predict , but at the very least it would bring a period of increased instability . 
No one can claim that any of this was unexpected . 
The dangers had been foreseen by numerous analysts and commentators long before the war started but they were ignored in Washington , mainly for ideological reasons . 
There were , of course , some in the neoconservative lobby who foresaw it too and thought it would be a good thing - shaking up the entire Middle East in a wave of `` creative destruction '' . 
The result is that even if the US tries to leave Iraq now , in purely practical terms it is unlikely to be able to do so . 
Professor van Creveld 's plan for withdrawal of ground troops is not so much a disengagement as a strategic readjustment . 
An American military presence will still be needed in the region , he says . 
`` Tehran is certain to emerge as the biggest winner from the war ... Now that Iraq is gone , it is hard to see how anybody except the United States can keep the Gulf states , and their oil , out of the mullahs ' clutches . 
`` A divided , chaotic , government-less Iraq is very likely to become a hornets ' nest . 
From it , a hundred mini-Zarqawis will spread all over the Middle East , conducting acts of sabotage and seeking to overthrow governments in Allah 's name . 
`` The Gulf States apart , the most vulnerable country is Jordan , as evidenced by the recent attacks in Amman . 
However , Turkey , Egypt and , to a lesser extent , Israel are also likely to feel the impact . 
Some of these countries , Jordan in particular , are going to require American assistance . '' 
As described in the article , van Creveld 's plan seems to imply that the US should abandon Iraq to its fate and concentrate instead on protecting American allies in the region from adverse consequences . 
A slightly different idea - pulling out ground troops from Iraq but continuing to use air power there - is already being considered in Washington , according to Seymour Hersh in the latest issue of the New Yorker magazine . 
The military are reportedly unhappy about this , fearing it could make them dependent on untrustworthy Iraqi forces for pinpointing targets . 
One military planner quoted by the magazine asked : `` Will the Iraqis call in air strikes in order to snuff rivals , or other warlords , or to snuff members of your own sect and blame it on someone else ? '' 
Focusing on air power has obvious political attractions for the Bush administration , since it is the safety of US ground troops that American voters are most concerned about . 
But , again , that would not amount to a real disengagement and would do little or nothing to improve America 's image in the region - especially if reliance on air strikes increased the number of civilian casualties . 
The inescapable fact is that the processes Mr Bush unleashed on March 20 2003 -LRB- and imagined he had ended with his `` mission accomplished '' speech six weeks later -RRB- will take a decade or more to run their course and there is little that anyone , even the US , can do now to halt them . 
In his eagerness for regime change in Iraq , Mr Bush blundered into a trap from which in the short term there is no way out : the Americans will be damned if they stay and damned if they leave .

2005-11-30,"Vice-president accused of backing torture Claims on BBC by former insider add to Bush 's woes Vice-president Dick Cheney 's burden on the Bush administration grew heavier yesterday after a former senior US state department official said he could be guilty of a war crime over the abuse of prisoners . 
Lawrence Wilkerson , who served as chief of staff to secretary of state Colin Powell from 2002 to 2005 , singled out Mr Cheney in a wide-ranging political assault on the BBC 's Today program . 
Mr Wilkerson said that in an internal administration debate over whether to abide by the Geneva conventions in the treatment of detainees , Mr Cheney led the argument `` that essentially wanted to do away with all restrictions '' . 
Asked whether the vice-president was guilty of a war crime , Mr Wilkerson replied : `` Well , that 's an interesting question - it was certainly a domestic crime to advocate terror and I would suspect that it is ... an international crime as well . '' 
In the context of other remarks it appeared he was using the word `` terror '' to apply to the systematic abuse of prisoners . 
The Washington Post last month called Mr Cheney the `` vice-president for torture '' for his demand that the CIA be exempted from a ban on `` cruel , inhuman and degrading '' treatment of detainees . 
Mr Wilkerson , a former army colonel , also said he had seen increasing evidence that the White House had manipulated pre-war intelligence on Iraq to make its case for the invasion . 
He said : `` You begin to wonder was this intelligence spun ? 
Did , in fact , the American people get fooled ? 
I am beginning to have my concerns . '' 
Mr Cheney has been under fire for his role in assembling evidence of weapons of mass destruction . 
Mr Wilkerson told the Associated Press that the vice-president must have sincerely believed Iraq could be a spawning ground for terrorism because `` otherwise I have to declare him a moron , an idiot or a nefarious bastard '' . 
Such charges have kept the Bush administration on the defensive for several months . 
Mr Bush yesterday repeated his earlier assertion that the US `` does not torture and that 's important for people around the world to realize '' . 
He is also due to make the first of a series of speeches today , outlining his plan to defeat the insurgency and pave the way for US withdrawal . 
The White House will also publish a declassified version of its war plan . 
But it has now emerged that two justice department memos listing permissible interrogation methods have been kept secret by the White House , even from the Senate intelligence committee . 
The New Yorker recently quoted a source who had seen a memo as calling it `` breathtaking '' . 
`` The document dismissed virtually all national and international laws regulating the treatment of prisoners , including war crimes and assault statutes , and it was radical in its view that in wartime the president can fight enemies by whatever means he sees fit , '' the magazine reported . 
One technique allegedly used by the CIA in questioning suspects is `` waterboarding '' -LRB- strapping a detainee to a board and submerging it until the prisoner believes he or she is drowning -RRB- . 
The White House is accused of defining `` torture '' so narrowly as to exclude such methods . 
But James Ross , a legal expert at Human Rights Watch said such a narrow definition was at odds with international norms . 
`` Waterboarding is clearly a form of torture . 
It has been used since the Inquisition . 
It was a well-known torture technique in Latin America , '' Mr Ross said . 
Human Rights Watch this year called for a special counsel to investigate any US officials - no matter their rank or position - who took part in , `` ordered , or had command responsibility for war crimes or torture , or other prohibited ill-treatment against detainees in US custody '' . 
The report focused on the defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , for his alleged command responsibility for abuses at Abu Ghraib , but Mr Wilkerson argued Mr Cheney was ultimately responsible . 
The US is a signatory to the 1984 UN Convention Against Torture , which bans inflicting `` severe pain or suffering , whether physical or mental '' . 
Such practices are also a crime under US federal law .

2005-12-01,"How do you turn a 400-year-old love poem into an opera about a TV journalist covering a modern middle-eastern war ? 
Stuart Jeffries talks to composer Judith Weir and the crew behind Armida Love conquers all ... Kenneth Tarver and Talise Trevigne in Armida In the Cafe de France in Essaouira , a beautiful walled city on Morocco 's Atlantic coast , some British people are making an opera . 
It 's called Armida and tells the story of a soldier and a TV newshound who set aside their differences during some nameless contemporary desert war and fall in love . 
But the locals do n't know or - let 's be honest - care about any of that . 
All they 're bothered about is that today is Thursday , Morocco 's national lottery day , and they need to buy their tickets from the bloke in the cafe 's back room . 
In between takes , a line of men is suffered by director Margaret Williams to walk across her set and return with a ticket each . 
Really , she should have shot the locals , too , and thereby made a second film featuring the characterful faces of Essaouira 's lottery junkies as they move nimbly across a landscape of cameras , cables , microphones and opera singers . 
It could have been a culture-clash ballet , or maybe a sitcom . 
But Williams 's task is difficult enough as it is . 
She is filming an opera to be screened on television . 
It 's the hardest job in the world - and , ratings-wise at least , one of the least rewarding . 
Have you ever tried to film a scene of soldiers playing football in a desert sandstorm with the sand lashing the opera singers ' faces and getting into the camera ? 
And have you ever tried to condense four centuries of myth-making about the Rinaldo and Armida love affair into a 50-minute opera that alludes to the Iraq war , without being exclusively about that conflict , to be screened on Channel 4 with one commercial break ? 
`` It 's even more difficult than that , '' says Philip Headlam , the conductor , removing his headphones between takes . 
`` It 's not like your normal opera from the canon , where everybody is familiar with the music and their roles in the story . 
Our singers have not heard it before , so it takes a lot of time and a lot of care to get it right . 
And then they have to perform in front of the cameras , which is very difficult if , as a singer , you 're not used to it . '' 
The opera has already been sung in a studio and now the singers have to act and sing their parts in sync with a tape played back in the cafe . 
Headlam 's task is to ensure they keep in time . 
Tricky enough without being interrupted after every take by impatient Essaouirans demanding their tickets . 
Judith Weir , the composer , is an oasis of calm amid the transcultural crossness . 
She sits , enviably self-contained , next to the cafe 's pool table , sipping mint tea from a glass . 
`` All my work is done . 
So I 'm really just here to observe - and have a holiday , '' she says . 
She started writing Armida in 2002 . 
`` All the eyes of the world were on Iraq at the time , but I was n't trying to write about Iraq in particular , just all the wars I 've lived through . '' 
This also presented her with an opportunity to think about the medium for which she had been commissioned to write - television . 
`` I wanted to write an opera which deals in part with the TV coverage of wars . 
We have become so aware of how we receive the news , and even how reporters come from behind the camera to talk about their feelings during conflict . 
So I wanted to engage with that . '' 
That 's not something you 'd expect an opera to do , at least not successfully . 
`` The position that classical music has in our society does make it rather removed from current affairs , '' Weir concedes . 
`` It 's presented as this refuge from modern life , where you go to have a comfortable sleep , often in a concert . 
I do n't think my work is removed from everyday life . '' 
She has certainly done her utmost to place the romantic story of Rinaldo and Armida , a Christian crusader and a Muslim witch , in today 's world . 
To anyone familiar with the many treatments of the tale , Weir 's version is a brave departure : Armida is no longer a sorceress but a TV news reporter , the setting a media-saturated desert conflict . 
It 's a controversial idea , and surely fraught with pitfalls . 
In Torquato Tasso 's 16th-century poem Jerusalem Delivered , which inspired nearly 100 operas and ballets -LRB- mostly baroque -RRB- , Armida is a hotsy-totsy Saracen sorceress at the time of the first Crusade , seeking to use her wiles to weaken the crusaders ' cause . 
She is enraged by the French crusader Rinaldo for freeing comrades she has bewitched , and also because he alone of the Christian army besieging Jerusalem remains unmoved by her charms . 
So she plans to kill him - but is so captivated by his beauty that she changes her mind . 
She carries him off to her enchanted castle on an island , where she puts him under a spell so that he falls in love with her . 
Eventually , Rinaldo is discovered on the island by his comrades , who confront him with his amorous folly by showing him his own degraded reflection in his shield . 
Rinaldo , though still torn by feelings of love for Armida , abandons her and declares revenge . 
Armida responds furiously by assembling an army , intending to kill Rinaldo . 
But when she finally meets him in an enchanted forest , her lingering affection for him renders her incapable of killing him , and she contemplates suicide . 
Rinaldo prevents her from destroying herself , and the two are reconciled with the implication that Armida will convert to Christianity and marry Rinaldo . 
But that is only one ending of the story . 
In the operatic adaptations by Gluck -LRB- 1777 -RRB- and Rossini -LRB- 1817 -RRB- , the drama ends when Rinaldo abandons Armida on her enchanted island . 
In Dvorak 's 1904 version , by contrast , a disguised Armida is killed by Rinaldo in battle and the pair are reconciled , as she dies , with her baptism . 
With all this weight of previous interpretation , how did Weir decide to tell the story ? 
The Dvorak version appealed least of all - not least because of its ending , which mingles the heroine 's death with Christian triumphalism . 
`` In fact , no one can say anything about the religious affiliation or ethnicity of any of the characters in my opera , '' says Weir . 
`` No one can say , this is a Muslim or this is a Christian . 
I wanted to show that I respect all the people in this piece . '' 
Both of the leads , Talise Trevigne and Kenneth Tarver , are black , thus perhaps further annulling the eurocentrism of Tasso 's original poem and several later treatments . 
Even more significantly , Weir did n't want her female heroine killed off . 
`` The issue of women singers in opera is important . 
Women have big roles in opera . 
But those characters nearly always die terrible deaths as they 're punished for their uppityness . 
I wanted a woman you could believe in and not a crazy opera type . '' 
Of the operas that precede hers , Weir says : `` Rossini 's is the one that still stands up . 
It is one of Maria Callas 's great roles . '' 
But while she admits that she was inspired by them , `` there is no quotation from them '' . 
Instead , her music is scored for an ensemble that is half jazz band and half classical group , and tips between the two . 
In Armida , Weir re-explores a theme she addressed in her earlier TV opera , Scipio 's Dream -LRB- a homage to Mozart also directed by Margaret Williams in 1991 -RRB- , namely the conflict between love and duty . 
Armida and Rinaldo are both torn by this conflict - they should n't love each other , since duty forbids it , but they do . 
`` I find the story interesting because it 's both a love story and a political story , '' says Weir . 
`` But it 's a love story , too , about the affair between the media and the war operation . 
It 's also a war story about love - because love can be a war as well . '' 
Her opera -LRB- she wrote both music and libretto -RRB- starts at the army camp from where the infidels are being besieged . 
Armida comes to the camp , ostensibly to interview the soldiers , but secretly to subvert their cause . 
But she falls in love with Rinaldo -LRB- a sensitive soul who writes poetry and quotes Taoist philosophy -RRB- , and whisks him off in her TV news helicopter to an enchanted Moorish city . 
His comrades try to free him , but he has other ideas . 
Ca n't they see he 's in love and has renounced war - as they should ? 
Unlike previous artists , Weir was hardly interested in using the story to press home a message of Christians triumphing over Muslims . 
And she emphasises that she did n't want to write `` an opera about Iraq '' . 
`` There was n't time to get into any sophisticated politics , '' she says , `` but I wanted to explore the idea , ` What if they held a war and nobody came ? ' '' 
Was she in favor of the Iraq war ? 
`` I think the whole thing is absolutely ludicrous . '' 
Armida is , then , an opera with an anti-war message . 
As viewers return again and again to the army camp , they find that the soldiers have started to plant lavender bushes and grow vegetables in the desert . 
And , around the world , enthusiasm for war and duty decline , while love triumphs . 
Nobody is interested in watching war porn ; instead , Metropolis TV now specialises in gardening shows and allied weather reports . 
Journalism , like soldiering , is to be replaced by what Weir in her libretto calls `` cultivation and repose '' . 
All of which , no doubt , is a healthy message in our benighted times . 
But it does make one hanker for the more fractious ending to Rossini 's version of Armida . 
There , the abandoned heroine , torn between love and anger , commands her spirits to destroy the enchanted island she created , before flying away on her chariot pulled by dragons amid thunder and lightning . 
Now , that would have made for good telly . 
But Channel 4 's opera budget probably does n't stretch that far .

2005-12-02,"Israeli firms are carrying out military training and commercial activities in Kurdish areas of north Iraq , according to reports in an Israeli newspaper . 
Yedioth Ahronoth reported yesterday that dozens of former members of Israel 's elite and covert forces were training Kurdish fighters in anti-terrorism techniques . 
Other companies , the newspaper said , were involved in telecommunications and infrastructure projects such as the building of an airport at Irbil . 
Iraq and Israel are still officially at war , though since the 1960s Israel and the Iraqi Kurds have had a relationship . 
A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said his country had no relationship with the new Iraq and it remained `` at war '' . 
The article follows detailed reports in the New Yorker last year saying that Israel had become heavily involved with the Kurds from 2003 . 
It suggested Israel had a strategic interest in supporting Kurdish forces , as a counterweight to Sunni and Shia groups in Iraq . 
Involvement in the region also gave Israel better access to intelligence from Syria and Iran , particularly Iran 's nuclear program . 
Israel supported Kurdish rebels against the Ba'ath regime in Baghdad until 1975 . 
The Kurds , who are Muslim , have never been as anti-Israeli as many Muslims in other countries . 
They have felt persecuted by Sunnis and have resented Yasser Arafat 's support for Saddam Hussein . 
A spokesman for the Kurdistan regional government said : `` It is possible that people with Israeli passports visit . 
Many Jews from Kurdistan resettled in Israel . 
We do not discriminate against any nationality that wants to ... work in Kurdistan , but there are no official links . '' 
Israel can not officially admit its involvement in the regime because it might encourage extremist groups , such as al-Qaida in Iraq . 
But Israelis are regularly seen in the Kurdish towns of northern Iraq , working as security guards and trainers . 
It is not clear whether they work for international security firms or are doing independent work . 
Israelis representing private firms were seen looking for opportunities at a recent trade fair in Irbil . 
Yesterday 's report also stated that Israeli companies had set up a base in a remote area of Kurdistan , using it for weapons and anti-terrorism training and bringing in `` dozens of motorcycles , sniffer dogs , Kalashnikov-upgrading devices , flak jackets , uniforms and helmets , all Israeli-made '' . 
It claims Israelis pose as agricultural and engineering experts . 
Development and security projects in Kurdistan are undertaken by several countries , including Turkey , the US , Iran , Britain and Germany . 
Israel 's main ally in the region is Turkey , which is concerned that the Kurds might declare independence from Iraq . 
Turkey , like Syria and Iran , has a substantial Kurdish minority within its population .

2005-12-03,"John Gray , academic , writer and public intellectual , was an unlikely Thatcherite , then an early Blairite . 
He is now the scourge of neocons and the disciples of science and rationalism If you had to fit the message of John Gray 's 14 books and innumerable articles on a sandwich board , it would be simple : you 're all doomed . 
Quite who is doomed , and why , has varied with the development of his thought . 
He started off as a Thatcherite and cold warrior , convinced that the postwar consensus and welfare state could not last . 
Then he became an early Blairite , warning against the dangers of Thatcherism . 
Now he attacks Blair as a dangerous neocon ; he has been an unyielding opponent of the Iraq war and he is convinced that globalisation will end in a welter of resource wars and ecological collapse . 
Peter Wilby , a former editor of the New Statesman who published him for three years , says : `` He 's one of life 's sceptics , really . 
Any kind of ideology - the more he looks at it , the more he decides that it crumbles apart . 
None of the emperors has any clothes so far as John is concerned . '' 
In all this , he sees himself as consistent . 
As a polemicist he has always argued against the conventional wisdom , and usually been about five years ahead of it . 
As a political philosopher , he believes he has always had a guiding principle : that there are certain limits on human life which politics can never abolish , and never wholly work around . 
Utopian or universal schemes will only make things worse . 
This sounds like conservatism ; but he also believes that real , reactionary conservatism is no longer possible : `` The right today likes to imagine that it is the voice of the past . 
In truth ... the fate of the right in the late modern age is to destroy what remains of the past in a vain attempt to recover it . '' 
Gray was born in 1947 into a world which the market has quite swept away : the working class of Tyneside , when they still had jobs . 
His father was a shipyard joiner in South Shields . 
They never thought of themselves as poor , he says ; others remember it differently . 
His childhood friend Robert Colls , now a historian at the University of Leicester , who grew up in the same part of town , remembers `` this poor brilliant boy living in a mixed area of town . 
His dad was disabled in his 50s . 
I think he had a hard time on the money front . '' 
In 1968 , he went up to Oxford to read PPE on a scholarship . 
Isaiah Berlin was at Oxford then , working on the most subtle and powerful justification for liberalism that anyone managed in the 20th century ; Gray , who became a friend , set out to overthrow it . 
Liberalism , said Berlin , is valuable because it lets people live in many different ways , seeking many different goals . 
But no one society , Gray objects , can encompass all the humanly fulfilling ways to live . 
Russia under totalitarianism\/communism was in some respects less materialistic and more respectful of culture than it is now , but these virtues were made possible only by a dreadful tyranny . 
His arguments on this topic are pitched in academic prose , but they can be boiled down into one line of Mick Jagger 's : We ca n't get no satisfaction . 
We are not the sort of creatures who could get lasting satisfaction , not just because we often want bad things instead of good ones , but because the goods we want ca n't be reconciled with each other . 
The Australian philosopher George Crowder claims that Gray must logically endorse Stalin and Hitler as offering legitimate models of society , something Gray cheerfully denies . 
The fact that our values , though real , are sometimes incompatible does n't mean they have nothing in common . 
It must be possible , he claims , to build some kind of minimal universal moral framework , even if this does not lead to liberalism : `` No society can be called good which rests on torture . '' 
His pessimistic twist on Berlin is also part of the rootless conservatism which has made him denounce the projects of the right as passionately as he denounced Marxism . 
He believes that human life can always be made better , but that this process does not approach perfection . 
New problems are always arising ; old gains can easily be lost . 
There is no steady ladder of progress ; but we are able , sometimes , to run up the down escalator . 
He rejects the idea that political debate starts from human rights . 
The process seems to him the other way round : that `` rights '' are something that emerge from a political process , and different rights may be produced under different political systems . 
None is inherent in all human beings , and the ones that we do recognize may conflict with each other . 
When they do so , we ca n't honestly resolve the problem by logic which everyone comes to accept , nor even , as Americans do , by handing the matter over to a Supreme Court . 
The final decision , says Gray , must be political . 
As a working-class undergraduate , he was a Thatcherite before Thatcher herself , a believer in the market , and a critic of planned economies . 
He read Hayek in the late 1960s , and understood his essential point to be that markets in some sense know more than any of the people who operate in them . 
It followed that state planning , and social engineering based on rational discussion were always likely to go wrong . 
This much was common among Thatcherites in the 70s , but unlike most Thatcherites , he saw that ripping down communities to make way for a market was itself a form of social engineering , though an often anti-social one . 
`` Give him any collection of pigeons and he 'll set a cat among them , '' says his friend the academic and publisher Henry Hardy . 
Gray 's views on council-house sales are a good example of his contrarian style - and of his appetite for anchoring large arguments in historical detail . 
The sale of council houses , he said , might have been good for the Conservative party in the short term , but it did nothing to decrease dependency on the state , as it was supposed to do . 
All it changed was the form of subsidy . 
`` Spending on housing benefit during 1996-67 was over 10 times the total cost of housing benefits in 1979-80 . 
Public expenditure on social housing was replaced , many times over , by rent rebates and assistance with the payment of mortgages . 
The price of privatising municipal housing in Britain has been a colossal increase in welfare dependency . '' 
This kind of inconsistency in Thatcherism led to his conversion to Blairism . 
As a Blairite in the days before there was a Blair government , he started to attack the costs of the free market : `` In the United States free markets have contributed to social breakdown on a scale unknown in any other developed country . 
Families are weaker in America than in any other country . 
At the same time , social order has been propped up by a policy of mass incarceration . 
No other advanced industrial country , aside from post-communist Russia , uses imprisonment as a means of social control on the scale of the United States . 
Free markets , the desolation of families and communities and the use of the sanctions of criminal law as a last recourse against social collapse go in tandem . '' 
Thatcherism was not just a local phenomenon . 
It was also recognized as a global symbol , and this was the next symbol against which he charged . 
Nothing could be more alien to his temperament than the 90s ' bland optimism that history was over and the whole world must converge , with greater or lesser success , on the model of the United States of America . 
For one thing , he argued , globalisation depends on the world being different . 
If it were all the same , there would be no reason to invest in one part of it rather than another . 
The vast , destabilising currency markets take as their premise the inequalities between nations , and then act to enlarge them , not to bring countries together . 
The spread of technology was inevitable and irreversible . 
But there was no reason to suppose that the spread of American technology meant the spread of American models of society ; and the examples of countries that had successfully enriched themselves with modern technology , such as Japan , shows that their differences from western models were essential to their success . 
Although he was prolific - 12 books - and successful , Gray was little known outside academic circles until the mid-90s . 
His first post , at the University of East Anglia , had been succeeded by a job at Jesus College , Oxford , where he remained for nearly 15 years . 
He held visiting professorships at Harvard and Yale . 
His writing has always had a chameleon quality . 
When he writes about Berlin his sentences stretch and then tangle and convolute like brain cells . 
When he writes about his favorite philosopher , the Spanish aphorist Santayana , his own style becomes elegant and precise . 
In 1998 he moved to the LSE , as professor of European thought , and in 2000 he published Straw Dogs , with Granta , rather than Routledge , which marked his breakthrough as a public intellectual . 
It is written in a wrought-up , aphoristic style . 
`` When will the Jews be forgiven the Holocaust ? '' 
he asks at one stage . 
But it was very widely and respectfully reviewed . 
His view of the world cut through the antidepressant euphoria of the 90s with a sense of a much nastier future ahead . 
In Straw Dogs , his pessimism became truly global , and entangled with environmentalism . 
The hubris which he had been denouncing all his life , first in socialism , then in neo-liberalism , was now identified with the notion of growth . 
Just as before , nemesis was to be supplied by nature . 
But this time it was not human nature that would ensure our doom , but nature itself . 
Since then , a series of short , punchy books has kept up with the troubles of the age . 
His essays for the New Statesman are being republished as Heresies with a characteristic subtitle : Against Progress and Other Illusions . 
His fiercest scorn has switched to the disciples of rationalism and of science : `` Of all modern delusions , the idea that we live in a secular age is the furthest from reality ... liberal humanism itself is very obviously a religion - a shoddy replica of Christian faith markedly more irrational than the original article , and in recent times more harmful . ''

2005-12-06,"Tuesday 6 December 2005 15.37 GMT At least 43 people were killed and 73 injured today when two suicide bombers blew themselves up in a police academy classroom in east Baghdad . 
An internet statement purporting to be from militant group al-Qaida in Iraq claimed responsibility for the attack . 
`` Two brothers targeted the police academy that continues to train dogs which feed off the blood and honor of Sunni Muslims ... the strength of the explosion destroyed a large part of the building , '' said the statement , which could not be immediately authenticated . 
The group , thought to be led by Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi , has been linked to last month 's Amman hotel bombings and believed to be behind the kidnap and murder of Briton Ken Bigley . 
Wearing explosive vests , the two bombers appeared to have coordinated their attacks to maximize casualties . 
All those killed or wounded were police trainees or officers , with the exception of one US contractor . 
`` One of the suicide bombers detonated near a group of students outside a classroom , '' the US military 's Task Force Baghdad said . 
`` Thinking the explosion was an indirect-fire attack , -LRB- Iraqi police -RRB- and students fled to a bunker for shelter where the second bomber detonated his vest . '' 
`` We were sitting in the yard when we heard an explosion , '' said police major Wisam al-Heyali . 
`` Seconds later , we were hit by another explosion as we were running . 
I saw some of my colleagues falling down and I felt my hand hit , but I kept on running . '' 
Training and recruitment courses for police and security forces have been a regular target of militants since the end of the Iraq war . 
Many Sunnis see the police as being dominated by Shia Muslims , and reports of extrajudicial killings of Sunnis by police officers have further stoked tensions . 
In September , a Baghdad police academy was targeted by a suicide bomber who killed seven people and wounded 30 . 
More than 20 died in a suicide attack on a graduation ceremony in south Baghdad in January . 
A suicide attack on a police recruitment center in the neighbouring northern province of Irbil in May claimed at least 60 lives . 
Yesterday , the US defense secretary , Donald Rumsfeld , admitted the insurgency had been stronger than anticipated but said the media had focused on the war 's growing death toll rather than the `` progress '' he claimed had been made . 
`` To be responsible , one needs to stop defining success in Iraq as the absence of terrorist attacks , '' Mr Rumsfeld added .

2005-12-07,"Wednesday 7 December 2005 19.25 GMT Pinter : to play domineering father Max in one of his most popular and controversial plays . 
Photo : Max Nash\/AP The Nobel prize-winning playwright Harold Pinter has called for Tony Blair to be tried for war crimes , in his acceptance speech to the Nobel committee . 
The 5,000-word speech excoriates the US government over Guantnamo Bay and its attempts to destabilise Nicaragua in the 1980s . 
But he saves his most savage comments for the UK , described as `` pathetic and supine '' and a `` bleating little lamb '' tagging along behind the US in its support for the Iraq war . 
`` The invasion of Iraq was a bandit act , an act of blatant state terrorism demonstrating absolute contempt for the concept of international law , '' he said . 
`` The invasion was an arbitrary military action inspired by a series of lies upon lies and gross manipulation of the media and therefore of the public ... a formidable assertion of military force responsible for the death and mutilation of thousands and thousands of innocent people . 
`` We have brought torture , cluster bombs , depleted uranium , innumerable acts of random murder , misery , degradation and death to the Iraqi people , and call it ` bringing freedom and democracy to the Middle East ' . '' 
The 75-year-old will not be attending Saturday 's award ceremony at the Swedish Academy in Stockholm because of poor health . 
He will be sending his publisher , Stephen Page , in his place to receive the 10m kroner prize . 
But the author of The Caretaker and The Birthday Party has recorded a video of himself reading the speech , looking frail in a wheelchair with a red blanket over his legs . 
In recent years he has been treated for cancer , and appeared with a bandaged head earlier this year when it was announced that he had been awarded the prize . 
One of the original `` angry young men '' who revolutionised British theater in the 1950s , he has lost none of his fury in the speech . 
`` How many people do you have to kill before you qualify to be described as a mass murderer and a war criminal ? 
More than enough , I would have thought , '' he said . 
`` Therefore it is just that Bush and Blair be arraigned before the international criminal court of justice . 
But Bush has been clever . 
He has not ratified the international criminal court of justice ... `` But Tony Blair has ratified the court and is therefore available for prosecution . 
We can let the court have his address if they 're interested : it is Number 10 , Downing Street , London . '' 
He also discusses his early plays , the creative process , and the ambiguity of language . 
Beginning with a 1958 quote in which he claims that `` a thing is not necessarily either true or false '' , he says that sometimes a writer has to escape questions about the uncertainty of truth and stand up for what they think is right . 
`` I believe that these assertions still make sense and do still apply to the exploration of reality through art `` So as a writer I stand by them , but as a citizen I can not . 
As a citizen I must ask : what is true , what is false ? '' 
"
2005-12-09,"' I feel I 'm carrying the world on my shoulders ' After Cindy Sheehan 's son died in Iraq , her protest outside Bush 's Texas ranch became a symbol of opposition to the war . 
Duncan Campbell joins her as she brings her campaign to Britain When Casey Sheehan joined the army in May 2000 , he was assured that he would never see combat . 
Four years later , he was killed in Iraq . 
Over the summer , his mother , Cindy , pitched a tent in front of George Bush 's Texas ranch . 
Others joined what was to become known as Camp Casey . 
Soon , Cindy Sheehan , a housewife and mature student , was the face of the opposition to the president 's Iraq policy - and a target of virulent abuse from right-wing commentators . 
Now she is in Britain for the first time , joining the anti-war movement here . 
`` This is the 21st century - killing is barbaric , '' she says on a taxi ride from Heathrow into central London , having just flown in from New York . 
`` I do n't buy into the fact that George Bush and Tony Blair ca n't be called terrorists because they are elected officials . 
This occupation of Iraq is killing innocent people by the thousand . '' 
Cindy , who has three surviving children , is weary . 
She 's had to cram her six-foot frame into economy class for the trip , and , besides , her life has become an exhausting series of meetings , rallies , interviews , speeches and anti-war campaigning . 
She has come a long way from her old life in Vacaville , California - not the sort of place normally associated with political activism . 
Camp Casey has closed down , at least for the winter , but Cindy remains a powerful symbol of the anti-war movement . 
Here is a mother who lost her eldest child in a war that was declared , she believes , on dubious grounds . 
She wants to make sure that the government is called to account . 
Her son Casey signed up in the final months of the Clinton era , at a time when there seemed to be little possibility of war in foreign fields . 
`` His recruiter told him that even if there was a war , he would never see combat because he had scored so high in the entrance exam - he 'd only be in a support role , '' says Cindy . 
`` He was a good soldier , he liked being in the army . 
He only went to Iraq because his buddies were going and they all feel a responsibility for each other . '' 
She has since met many of his fellow soldiers and the sergeant who tried to talk Casey out of going on the mission that killed him . 
`` Casey just said , ` ` Where my chief goes , I go ' , and he left and he was killed . 
I get feedback from the troops all the time and 99.9 % say , ` Keep on doing what you 're doing because it 's a nightmare here and we want to come home and it 's only people like you in the peace movement that give us hope ' . '' 
During this trip to Britain , she will address Saturday 's International Peace Conference -LRB- organised by the Stop the War Coalition -RRB- , and will also meet members of the Scottish parliament and fellow activists , including Britons who have lost their sons or brothers in the war . 
Then it will be back to her new home in Berkeley and on with the work for her new book - about how one person can have a political impact by just getting on with it . 
She is very unimpressed with Bush 's rationale for the war . 
`` He keeps coming up with the same inane speech as though that 's going to rally people back to support him . 
As for his ` national strategy for victory ' - would n't it have been nice if they had started to plan for that before they invaded in the first place and killed so many brave young Americans like Casey ? 
It 's gratifying that America is now opening its eyes and I 'm not so wacky and out there by myself any more . 
We are not the ` extreme ' people any more . 
Look at the polls , George Bush , you 're the one who 's at the extremes . '' 
The Democrats have also largely been a disappointment , she says , not least Hillary Clinton . 
`` She 's very wishy-washy , she 's playing the middle because she wants to be president and I look at all the politicians who want to be president and they are basically playing the middle , too , '' she says . 
`` It obviously did n't work for John Kerry , and I told him : ` If you had come out strongly against the war and said you would start bringing the troops home , you would have won in a landslide ' . 
But he has this memory that he did come out strongly against the war ! 
Howard Dean -LRB- the unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic Party nomination -RRB- told me the war is a hard issue . 
No , it 's not . 
Our kids are there being killed and they 're killing innocent Iraqis for lies . 
It 's not brain surgery . '' 
Cindy 's campaigning work leaves her no time for anything else , she says - something that her other children have had to adjust to . 
They have been very supportive , though , and recently went to dinner with her and Jane Fonda , another supporter , and Fonda 's daughter . 
Joan Baez has been a frequent and supportive visitor to the camp , as have a surprising array of Republicans , she says . 
She is not surprised to have been the target of the conservative Fox news channel and others on the right , but is gratified that the mainstream media have given the camp some coverage . 
`` They had been very creative in not covering the anti-war movement up until then . '' 
Cindy is 48 , too young to have been involved in the anti-Vietnam war movement . 
`` I remember there was a lot of violence on campuses , which was kind of frightening to me . '' 
She is hopeful that the current movement will continue beyond the end of the war in Iraq , and she has been in touch with Iraqis who have lost children fighting on the other side . 
`` I do n't blame the people who killed Casey but the people who brought us into this , who lied and deceived the world , '' she says . 
`` But the anti-war movement is growing at all levels . 
Congress is starting to talk about bringing the troops home and you never saw any of that before . '' 
The non-stop campaigning has taken its toll , she says , and Cindy feels in need of a good massage : `` I really feel I 'm carrying the whole world on my shoulders , '' she says . 
There has been talk of her entering politics herself , but at the moment it does not appeal . 
`` An illegal and immoral war is n't a political issue , it 's a matter of life and death , and everybody has to do the right thing no matter what party they are in . '' 
Then she is off for a couple of hours sleep in Muswell Hill , north London , before addressing yet another meeting , and shaking the hands of yet more politicians .

2005-12-10,"Zaki Chehab and Kathy Gannon bring years of experience to bear on accounts of how the west has dealt with Iraq and Afghanistan , says Ewen MacAskill Iraq Ablaze : Inside the Insurgency by Zaki Chehab -LRB- 220pp , IB Tauris , # 17.99 -RRB- I is for Infidel : From Holy War to Holy Terror in Afghanistan by Kathy Gannon -LRB- 320pp , Public Affairs , # 14.99 -RRB- So many of the journalists who have covered the Iraq conflict have felt a need to write a book that publishers are becoming more selective and rejection slips have become the norm . 
Zaki Chehab is , rightly , one of the exceptions . 
As an Arab , a Palestinian brought up in one of the refugee camps of the Lebanon , he can reach places and people in Iraq denied to almost all western reporters . 
He has spent time with the Iraqi insurgents who would have been suspicious of , or might even have killed , American or European reporters , few of whom are now willing to take the risk of making contact . 
Chehab , political editor of London-based al-Hayat , has not produced a comprehensive account of the Iraqi insurgency , but it is the best yet . 
He argues convincingly that the insurgency is driven primarily by nationalism , by Iraqis resentful that their country is under occupation by a US-led force . 
Although he allows plenty of space for Abu Musab Zarqawi and other foreign fighters , he says the insurgency is primarily home-grown . 
Touring round the Sunni Muslim-dominated areas , the center of the insurgency , he concludes that 99 % of Sunnis are opposed to the occupation . 
Although the foreign fighters make up a small proportion of the fighters , they have been responsible for some of the bloodiest suicide bombings and kidnappings . 
Chehab has a long passage about Zarqawi , the Jordanian-born leader of al-Qaida in Iraq . 
The author is ambiguous about whether he met him , but probably has not , though he interviewed Zarqawi supporters in jail . 
Chehab is not a late-comer to Iraq , arriving only for the war in 2003 . 
He was sent to Baghdad in 1978 , on his very first assignment , by a Palestinian magazine . 
He is good on the events running up to the war and the interaction between the US neocons and Iraqi exiles . 
But there is little new in this and the best of the book is his descriptions of meetings with Iraqis post-war , from tribal leaders to the fighters , and chronicling the many mistakes the Americans have made since the invasion , turning even those who might have supported them into enemies . 
Like Chehab , Kathy Gannon is a reporter and , like him , she has not come late to her story , Afghanistan . 
She is unusual among the present generation of foreign correspondents . 
The tendency now , even more pronounced than before , is for foreign correspondents to spend a few years in a country and then move on . 
Gannon has spent 18 years covering Afghanistan and Pakistan for the Associated Press news agency , finally leaving this year for a posting in Iran . 
The abiding memory , at least in Britain , of the fall of Kabul in 2001 was its `` liberation '' by the BBC 's John Simpson . 
Gannon , a Canadian , had , in fact , been there all along , the only westerner in Kabul throughout the US bombing . 
She is critical of Afghanistan 's various rulers - including some in the present coalition government - and also of the Americans and the role played by Pakistan . 
She expresses repugnance at the warlords who became allies of the Americans and remain in power , recalling in detail massacres and other atrocities they were involved in , their roles either unknown or diplomatically forgotten by the west . 
She goes back over how the US , in its enthusiasm for driving the Soviets out of Afghanistan , armed and encouraged jihadists from the Afghan refugee camps as well as Muslim fighters from around the world . 
So many of the problems of the first years of the 21st century can be traced back to America 's failure to think through the consequences of encouraging jihad : both Osama bin Laden and Zarqawi are products of the Afghanistan war . 
Gannon recalls , among many incidents , the US pumping out inspirational literature of its own for the Afghan refugee camps , where US-printed school books taught the alphabet by using such examples as J for Jihad , K for Kalashnikov and I for Infidel . 
She says the west , after the fall of the Taliban , promised not to abandon Afghanistan again , but that is exactly what has happened . 
Apart from Kabul , she maintains Afghanistan today looks remarkably like it did in 1992 , with the warlords filling the power vacuum and the US unwilling to provide the funding for restructuring . 
`` Afghanistan 's tragedy , '' she concludes , `` is that to the world 's powers , it has never really mattered - or has not mattered for long . ''

2005-12-12,"There was no plush bar , no glitterati babble over bubbly . 
The audience gathered in a drab school foyer in central London . 
Like many theater first nights , there was a guest list -LRB- `` Katharine Hamnett plus 2 , Jeremy Corbyn plus 5 , military families plus 25 '' -RRB- , but no lavish hospitality . 
Filing into the chilly school hall , with its rows of austere polypropylene chairs and a pair of flaccid white balloons hanging glumly from a rafter , one was reminded of Linda in Nancy Mitford 's The Pursuit of Love : `` The worst of being a Communist is that the parties you may go to are awfully funny and touching , but not very gay , and they 're always in such gloomy places . '' 
This was , however , an Event : the world premiere of Peace Mom , a new play by Dario Fo , the 79-year-old Nobel laureate , based on the writings of Cindy Sheehan . 
Her touching and personal protest after the death of her son Casey , a US soldier in Iraq , has galvanised anti-war sentiment , and last week she brought her campaign to Britain . 
Fo , with Franca Rame , his wife and collaborator , flew over for the performance , staged by Stop the War and directed by Michael Kustow . 
Why had he been attracted to the Sheehan story ? 
`` One of the things that grabbed me is that that there is an epic quality to the letters that Sheehan wrote to George Bush , and especially Barbara Bush , '' he said . 
`` There is a rhythm and tempo in her prose which recalls the great epic writers of Greece . 
When she writes : ' I am the mother of a son killed in Iraq ; you are the mother of the man who killed him , ' it is almost hendecasyllabic -LRB- the classical poetic metre -RRB- . 
`` She has a gift of candor and directness and epic simplicity - Cindy may not know it but she is a born writer . '' 
The play is a monologue , a tapestry of Sheehan 's letters to Bush and Fo 's invention . 
The actor Frances de la Tour performs with script in hand - this was billed as work-in-progress . 
Fo has been sending additions and revisions until the eleventh hour . 
De la Tour 's rich contralto rings out ; a contrast with Sheehan 's fluting , soft soprano . 
Sheehan sits in the audience next to Fo and Rame . 
Her usual beatific smile remains intact . 
But when de la Tour delivers the line : `` About a month after his death I said to myself : I 've had enough of crying for my own son , now I 'm going to cry for all mothers , '' her tears fall . 
In the row in front , vigorous anti-war campaigner Jeremy Corbyn , MP for Islington north , rests his eyes . 
The play is funny and touching ; but not very gay . 
Afterwards , Sheehan and de la Tour entwine hands . 
`` Frances did an amazing job of conveying my feeling of anger and betrayal , especially when she said what I wrote to Barbara Bush , '' says Sheehan . 
`` Casey was honorable and brave and sweet and he was murdered by the Bush family . '' 
Kustow hopes that when de la Tour goes to Broadway in the spring to act in Alan Bennett 's The History Boys they can stage the play in New York , and he would like to produce it on TV . 
Many strange things have happened to Sheehan since her son was killed on April 4 2004 , but surely few can match the surprise that she received a few days ago when she learned that a Nobel-prizewinning playwright had written a monologue based on her letters to George Bush , that she was to watch it in a school hall in London , and that it would performed by one of the English-speaking world 's great actors . 
`` My whole life is surreal and bizarre , '' she said . 
`` I hope the play can be used as an anti-war tool , to put a human face on this war , to show Casey had a life , was a person . ''

2005-12-14,"Wednesday 14 December 2005 18.17 GMT The US president , George Bush , today admitted much of the intelligence used as the basis for invading Iraq had been `` wrong '' - but defended his decision to go to war because it removed Saddam Hussein . 
In a speech at the Woodrow Wilson Centre , in Washington , Mr Bush also pledged that US troops would remain in Iraq until `` victory is achieved '' . 
The speech was the fourth and last in a series aimed at bolstering flagging support for the Iraqi conflict . 
`` It is true that much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong , '' Mr Bush said . 
`` As president , I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq . '' 
However , he added : `` My decision to remove Saddam Hussein was the right decision . 
Saddam was a threat , and the American people and the world is better off because he is no longer in power . '' 
The intelligence Mr Bush could have been referring to may be the pre-war information gathered from Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi , a Libyan , who claimed al-Qaida was linked to Iraq . 
Mr Libi later said he made his most specific claims whilst in Egyptian custody in a bid to avoid `` harsh treatment '' . 
In a CIA report published in the New York Times last week , unnamed officials admitted that Mr Libi been subjected to rendition when he told his interrogators that Iraq had trained al-Qaida operatives . 
Before the Iraq war , the Bush administration frequently cited Mr Libi 's information as `` credible evidence '' . 
On the eve of Iraq 's first parliamentary elections , the US president pledged to solve the previous problems with his administration 's intelligence capabilities . 
He was adamant that US troops would remain in Iraq until a `` free and democratic '' country was in place . 
`` We can not and will not leave Iraq until victory is achieved , '' he said . 
Mr Bush reiterated his hopes that an Iraq with a functioning democracy and thriving economy would be a model for other nations in the Middle East . 
In the Senate , 40 Democrats and one independent signed a letter to Mr Bush in which they urged him to be more open with the Iraqi and US public . 
The letter urged the administration to `` tell the leaders of all groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the compromises necessary to achieve the broad-based and sustainable political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq within the schedule they set for themselves '' . 
It adds that Mr Bush must also present `` a plan that identifies the remaining political , economic , and military benchmarks that must be met and a reasonable schedule to achieve them '' . 
The president responded by outlining what constituted victory in Iraq and when US troops could begin returning home . 
`` Victory will be achieved by meeting certain objectives : when the terrorists and Saddamists can no longer threaten Iraq 's democracy , when the Iraqi security forces can protect their own people , and when Iraq is not a safe haven for terrorists to plot attacks against our country , '' he said . 
`` These objectives , not timetables set by politicians in Washington , will drive our force levels in Iraq . ''

2005-12-14,"The sickness bequeathed by the west to the Muslim world The Iranian president 's support for Holocaust denial is a measure of how far the infection of Jew-hatred has spread There were few memorable moments in the election campaign of 2005 , but there 's one I wo n't forget . 
It came when I was interviewing a group of Muslim voters in Edinburgh , asking how the Iraq war had unsettled their political allegiances . 
One older man began telling me that he did not blame Tony Blair or even George Bush for the way things had turned out , because they were mere dupes of a more powerful force . 
The calamity of 9\/11 was not all it seemed : the authors of that event were not the 19 hijackers , but more shadowy players , unknown even to Bush . 
Later , as he gave me a lift to the station , I asked who these secret powers might be . 
The answer was `` rich Jewish people '' . 
I told him that just as there were plenty of lies told about Muslims , so there were lies told about Jews - and that neither of us should accept either . 
I put the comments to one side , dismissing them as the ramblings of one man . 
Again and again in recent years , I 've made the same move . 
I 've read the reports of sermons in the Arab world , denouncing Judaism and Jews , and tried to see a wider context . 
So I saw the vox pop on Saudi TV asking people on the street whether they would ever shake hands with a Jew - unanimous answer : no - and guessed that perhaps this was an exceptional item , hardly indicative . 
I read the transcript of an interview with Basmallah , a three-year-old girl , again aired on Saudi TV , who was introduced as a `` Muslim girl , a true Muslim '' . 
Here 's the exchange : Host : Basmallah , do you know the Jews ? 
Basmallah : Because they are apes and pigs . 
I shuddered to read such a thing . 
But it was translated and distributed by the Middle East Media Research Institute , and , like others , I wondered about the group 's motives : Memri was founded by a veteran of Israeli military intelligence . 
-LRB- On the other hand , few challenge the accuracy of Memri 's translations : unpalatable though they are , the texts Memri finds are all too real . -RRB- 
Such has been my standard operating procedure , constantly trying to see if there 's a way to contextualise these incidents , to see them in proportion . 
My motivation was not complicated : I prefer my Jewish identity to be positive , rather than defined by a perennial defense against anti-semitism . 
But everyone has their limits and last week I reached mine . 
On Thursday the president of Iran chose to stand with the cranks , neo-fascists and racists who deny the factual truth of the Holocaust . 
`` Some European countries insist on saying that Hitler killed millions of innocent Jews in furnaces , '' said Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 
`` Although we do n't accept this claim ... '' Suddenly , the usual apologetics wo n't work . 
No one can say Iran 's president was really complaining about Israel or Zionism , rather than Jews . 
No one can say he was talking about the west 's colonial crimes . 
He was peddling , instead , one of the defining tropes of the racist hard right : Holocaust denial . 
It is a stance that seeks to deny Jews their history , their suffering , almost their very being . 
Like denying that African-Americans were ever slaves , it is a move made by those who wish only harm . 
In this light , Ahmadinejad 's previous musings look rather different . 
When , in October , he stood beneath a banner that promised `` A world without Zionism '' and called for Israel to be `` wiped off the map '' , many Jews felt a chill at what seemed an annihilationist fantasy . 
Cooler heads said no , this was merely the hyperbolic style of the region , deployed to press a robust anti-Zionist rather than anti-semitic case . 
What he wanted , they explained patiently , was a world without Zionism , not a world without Jews . 
Well , now I 'm done with the charitable explanations . 
A man who refuses to believe the historic truth is capable of anything . 
This is not an Arabic cable TV station or an obscure Egyptian newspaper . 
This is a head of government , the leader of a nation of 70 million - a country that aspires to lead the Muslim world . 
And , lest we forget , Iran has nuclear ambitions . 
So now it 's not paranoid to worry about a president with annihilationist dreams - it 's smart . 
Unfortunately , it does n't end with Ahmadinejad , a man with no experience outside Iran , a hick who , Iranian analyst Dr Ali Ansari concedes , is a `` monumental embarrassment '' . 
For he has given voice to a sentiment that runs deep in Iran and in the wider Muslim world . 
Just look at this week 's Iranian press . 
`` Many revisionist historians believe the story of the Holocaust is fake and have proved it by much evidence and documents , '' says the conservative paper Resalat . 
Hardline Siyasat-e Ruz applauds the leader for `` revealing the truth '' . 
It 's hardly a surprise . 
TV stations across the Muslim world have been running this garbage for ages , along with lurid anti-semitism . 
Jordanian TV 's Ramadan special this year was Al-Shatat , a Syrian-produced series that speaks of a `` global Jewish government '' and depicts the ancient blood libel : the accusation that Jews use the blood of Christian children in preparing food for Passover . 
That was a follow-up to Egyptian television 's Ramadan treat in 2002 : Horseman without a Horse , whose central theme was the Protocols of the Elders of Zion , the century-old forgery concocted by the Tsarist secret police which alleged a Jewish plot to take over the world . 
We can deny it no longer : the virus of anti-semitism has infected the Muslim world . 
And virus it is , for Jew-hatred on this scale , as Christian Europe can testify , is a kind of sickness . 
This is one of the grossest legacies bequeathed by the west : that Muslims have taken to heart a form of anti-semitism alien to their own lands , borrowing a language and iconography that was made in Christendom . 
Blood libels and the Protocols were dreamed up in Norwich , Mainz or Moscow - yet now they breathe anew in Cairo , Riyadh and Damascus . 
This represents a menace to Jews , of course , but also a tragedy for Muslims . 
Theirs is a tradition that historically valued learning , and when an ignoramus like Ahmadinejad denies the overwhelming weight of historical evidence he makes a mockery of that tradition . 
In a period Jews still look back on as a golden age , Muslims were the people of scholarship , of science , of tolerance and coexistence - a contrast with the Crusader barbarians . 
Yet now many lap up the myths and lies that were once fed to the peasants of Europe , lies which endured through to the last century - and which led all the way to Treblinka . 
Today 's Muslims should want no part of such ignorance or bigotry . 
So Azzam Tamimi of the Muslim Association of Britain is to be applauded for his implicit condemnation of Ahmadinejad at the Stop the War conference at the weekend , telling his audience that , whatever their views , they could not deny the fact of the Holocaust . 
Now the Muslim Council of Britain should follow his lead , and that of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in the US , which also condemned this preacher of hate . 
And those non-Muslim progressives who have made alliances with Islamists should do the same . 
It may mean some uncomfortable conversations - but the days of denial must end .

2005-12-15,"President accepts full responsibility for invasion Pentagon to plant pro-US stories in global media President Bush conceded yesterday that much of the pre-war intelligence on Iraq `` turned out to be wrong '' but took sole responsibility for ordering the invasion , which he said was justified by the potential threat posed by Saddam Hussein . 
Mr Bush has acknowledged flaws in US intelligence on Iraq before , but this was his most wholehearted acknowledgment to date of the scale of the errors underlying his administration 's allegations over Saddam 's alleged weapons of mass destruction . 
`` It is true that much of the intelligence turned out to be wrong , '' he said . 
But he repeated the administration 's frequently made defense that other intelligence agencies had made similar mistakes , and Democratic politicians had voted for war based on the same intelligence the president had seen . 
However , Mr Bush acknowledged that the final decision to invade had been his alone . 
`` As president , I am responsible for the decision to go into Iraq , '' he said . 
It was revealed yesterday , on the eve of elections in Iraq , that the Pentagon had set up a $ 300m -LRB- # 170m -RRB- psychological warfare operation that involves placing pro-American messages in foreign media outlets across the world , including those of its allies , without disclosing the US government as the source . 
One of the military officials in charge of the program told USA Today the campaign was designed to counter terrorist ideology and sway foreign audiences to support American policies . 
It will target newspapers , websites , radio and television . 
The revelations come amid the growing controversy over the US military 's covert operations to plant `` good news '' in the Iraqi media by paying newspapers to run stories . 
Military officials involved with the latest Pentagon campaign said they did not plan to place false stories in foreign news outlets clandestinely . 
But Mike Furlong , the deputy director of the joint psychological operations support element , told the newspaper that the military would not always reveal its role in distributing pro-American messages . 
`` While the product may not carry the label ` Made in the USA ' , we will respond truthfully if asked -LRB- by journalists -RRB- , '' he said . 
The Pentagon was also under scrutiny yesterday for its activities inside the US following claims that it has a secret database on those who oppose the Iraq war and may also be monitoring peace demonstrations . 
The database , obtained by the NBC television network , lists 1,500 `` suspicious incidents '' across the US over a 10-month period and includes four dozen anti-war meetings or protests , some aimed at military recruiting , The monitoring of anti-war activities has been treated with suspicion by Americans since the Vietnam era when it emerged the Pentagon spied on anti-war and civil rights campaigners . 
The White House and Pentagon refused to comment on the Pentagon 's plans to place pro-American stories in foreign media outlets . 
It is legal for the government to plant propaganda in other countries but not in the US . 
According to USA Today , special operations command awarded three five-year contracts in June for contractors to develop slogans , advertisements , newspaper articles , radio spots and television programs overseas to build support for US policies . 
Among the companies to have been awarded a contract is the Lincoln Group , a firm set up in Washington two years ago and run by a Briton , Christian Bailey . 
Military chiefs are currently investigating the program and the reported payment of Iraqi journalists and newspapers to run pro-American stories .

2005-12-16,"What makes a great war film ? 
As Sam Mendes ' Jarhead tackles the 1991 Gulf conflict , James Meek , who has reported from the battlefields of Iraq , gives his verdict Fire away : a scene from Jarhead Oscar night in April 1979 marked a shift of key for the Hollywood war film , a genre whose explosions keep going off in newspaper columns and political discourse long after the closing credits have rolled . 
Michael Cimino 's The Deer Hunter , about an Orthodox community in a steel town whose sons go to Vietnam , won best film and best director . 
Cimino was given one statuette by Francis Ford Coppola - whose own Vietnam movie , Apocalypse Now , was destined for a cooler critical reception when it limped into the cinemas a few months later - and the other by John Wayne . 
It was Wayne 's last public appearance before he died . 
His attempt , as actor-director , to apply the propagandistic certainties of his second world war films to a celluloid Vietnam , The Green Berets , had been a failure as art or entertainment or , indeed , propaganda . 
Another Vietnam film , Coming Home , won Jane Fonda a best actress Oscar that night . 
According to Peter Biskind , Fonda , whose visit to Communist North Vietnam during the war still makes her an object of hate for the American right , lashed out at Cimino backstage , saying The Deer Hunter was a `` racist , Pentagon version of the war '' . 
Two decades later , along with their M16s , gas masks and Kevlar helmets , the young US marines preparing for war in the Arabian desert in Sam Mendes ' new film , Jarhead , carry a new piece of equipment into battle : irony . 
Watching Apocalypse Now on base at Camp Pendleton , the marine characters in the Mendes movie sing along with The Ride of the Valkyries broadcast from the attack helicopters in the Coppola movie . 
In camp in Saudi Arabia , they sit down to enjoy a video of The Deer Hunter only to find that the wife who sent it has deliberately taped over the Cimino film with a home movie of her having sex with the neighbor . 
Mendes is doing a couple of things with the references to post-Vietnam classics . 
One is to point out that thoughtful liberal film-makers who set out to make movies showing the futility and waste of war run the risk of celebrating it instead for that significant host of men who , among themselves , only glory in their association with death - the risk of receiving it , and the chance of dealing it out . 
Like the Wall Street brokers who burst into cheers when Gordon Gekko , the supposed-to-be-odious broker in Oliver Stone 's Wall Street , declares `` Greed is good '' , like the Russian mafia neophytes who reportedly based their philosophy on The Godfather , films about US marines are bound to be watched by US marines . 
Now that the US , like Britain , has an all-volunteer military - in Vietnam , most of the troops were conscripts - your average marine is much more likely to be the kind of guy who is in uniform because he yearns to feel what it is like to be afraid of violent injury , and what it is like to frighten others . 
When I asked a 19-year-old marine in Iraq last year why he 'd joined up , he said : `` I 've always been into explosions and , you know , just , just , uh , action movies . '' 
The other side of the ironic references to Vietnam films in Jarhead is provocative . 
`` Compare mine to theirs , '' it says . 
It 's ballsy and risky of Mendes to put Jarhead up against The Deer Hunter and Apocalypse Now - the latter having so grown in reputation since it appeared . 
Can they be compared ? 
Is Jarhead a war film ? 
What is a war film , anyway - is Schindler 's List a war film ? 
Is Lawrence of Arabia -LRB- another film Mendes references visually -RRB- ? 
Is the musical Oh What a Lovely War a war film , or The Crying Game ? 
Is Wag the Dog a war film ? 
There 's a war in it , but not a real one . 
Millions are killed off-screen , and there are heaps of skulls , but there is n't exactly a war in The Killing Fields . 
Brian De Palma made a feature in 1987 in which an idealistic young officer and his tough , experienced sergeant lead a group of heavily armed misfits into battle against an evil , equally heavily armed foe which threatens everything they and their families hold dear . 
Bullets fly , there are casualties on both sides ; in the end right triumphs over both might and cynicism . 
But The Untouchables is n't a war film . 
All war films tell two stories , the story of a war , and the story of the men fighting it . 
-LRB- Although large numbers of women have served in the US marines since the 1980s , you would n't know this from Jarhead -RRB- . 
By this measure , Mendes ' movie certainly counts as a war film , yet , based as it is on Anthony Swofford 's memoir of a stint in the US marines which took him to the Arabian Gulf , it has more in common with the clutch of Vietnam films that appeared in the late 1980s than with those of 1979 - Oliver Stone 's Platoon , Stanley Kubrick 's Full Metal Jacket and John Irvin 's Hamburger Hill . 
Less `` pity the world that has war visited upon it '' ; more `` pity the poor soldier '' . 
It 's more to do with how a group of young American men party , quarrel , bitch , brawl , boast , pose , amuse themselves and bond in an intimate group facing danger than about the wider impact of war on families , civilians or the world at large . 
Jarhead is , nonetheless , an oddity . 
It begins conventionally enough . 
There are certain cinematic rites of passage which non-Americans have seen so often that it is almost as if they have become part of their own childhood . 
I sometimes feel as if I once asked a girl to the senior prom by a bank of metal lockers in the corridor of a mid-western high school ; as if I walked through a screen door to shoot baskets with my eager-to-bond father in the twilight in the forecourt outside our non-existent garage ; and as if , once , I stood in green fatigues on a hot parade ground , being shrieked at by a sergeant - black , naturally - in a broad-brimmed hat , to whom I would yell back : `` SIR , YES , SIR ! '' 
Swofford , played by Jake Gyllenhaal , endures this experience and the usual set of boot camp humiliations . 
What makes the film peculiar both as a war film and as a reflection on America 's present hideous entanglement in Iraq is its timing and the Twilight Zone-nature of the war Swofford and his comrades are eventually sent to take part in . 
Jarhead is set in the 1991 Gulf War , when US troops led a genuine international coalition - including , it is strange to remember now , troops from Syria , Egypt , Saudi Arabia and France - to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait , leaving Iraq as soon as they 'd achieved this . 
Their commander in chief is George Bush , but it 's the other George Bush , the present White House incumbent 's father . 
The only Arabs the marines get close to in the film are shimmery Bedouin on the horizon and the charred , unrecognisable bodies of Iraqi troops subject to US air attack . 
None of the marines in Swofford 's section fire a shot in anger ; the only US casualties are those killed by friendly fire . 
The young American warriors in Jarhead do n't get the chance to be a threat to Arabs - the nearest Swofford gets is having an Iraqi officer in the sights of his sniper 's rifle and reading about the killing of an Arab by Albert Camus - and never seem threatened themselves . 
Swofford gets rained on by crude oil , sits down to commune with a set of scorched Iraqi corpses , is made to shovel shit with a Santa Claus hat on his head and loses a comrade after they 're discharged , but the thing that seems to affect him most deeply is being dumped , while in the desert , by his girlfriend . 
Since the character played by Gyllenhaal is a fit , attractive , educated 20-year-old American male , and since there is nothing in the film to tell us anything about their relationship except that Swofford really liked having sex with her , you may find it hard to equate his plight with , say , the experience of having your entire family wiped out when a bomb is dropped on your house by mistake . 
Historically , the lack of fighting the US marines were involved in on the ground in 1991 , while the allied air armada roared overhead , dealing death and destruction on Iraq , is accurate . 
Their main role was as a feint , making the Iraqis think they were going to land on Kuwait 's beaches . 
When they finally entered Kuwait - some time after air power and the tanks of the US , British and French armies had chased the Iraqis north - there was n't much for the marines to do except take the surrender of thousands of Iraqi troops . 
Yet it 's odd to have such a non-war war film playing in the cinemas when , before and after the performance , you 'll be reading in the papers and watching on TV about scores of Iraqis being killed in car bombs , about US marines being killed by roadside bombs , about Iraqis and Afghans being tortured or arrested or killed or having their property damaged by US troops , about anti-war feelings growing inside America . 
In a curious way , an earlier 1991 Gulf War feature , Three Kings , though it was too hip , funky and sentimental to be a great film , engaged better than Jarhead does with today 's disaster in Iraq - and Three Kings was made in 1999 , when the dismal phrase `` war on terror '' had n't sounded around the world . 
The pundits do on occasion work themselves up into a lather about how `` realistic '' a war film is . 
There was excitement , when Steven Spielberg brought out Saving Private Ryan , at how genuine the portrayal of the slaughter on the beaches in the early hours of D-Day was . 
Although very few people alive today , including serving soldiers , have experienced that sustained intensity of combat , it did have the appearance of authenticity . 
Yet that realism counts for nothing if the characters and story in the film are n't real too -LRB- Private Ryan ends absurdly with a Magnificent Seven-style shootout -RRB- . 
Perhaps it is asking too much of war films to be realistic when war itself is so unlike the reality western audiences know . 
It 's not that actors are incapable of capturing the intensity of men at war . 
What they can not do is capture the vacancy of men at war . 
Apart from the technical difficulty of conveying to cinema audiences the actual loudness of military explosives , and the fact actors are usually too old for raw recruits -LRB- Gyllenhaal is 25 , his sniping partner Peter Sarsgaard 34 , when the average age of boot camp newbies is 19 -RRB- , the dramatic demands of a commercial film make it impossible to capture the salient characteristic of ordinary soldiers - that they are exhausted most of the time . 
Jarhead is a war film , but it is constricted , like Platoon , by the narrow vision of the pity-the-soldier genre . 
Indeed , Jarhead often slips into envy-the-soldier territory for naive young men - the lack of gore , the marines ' experience of war as freakish , transient vision , the sheer boyish locker-room fun Swofford and his pals enjoy in the desert as they booze , boogie and flex their torsos , means Jarhead wo n't be troubling US recruiters in the way today 's news footage does . 
The key to a film about war is how it ends , and if the young man at the film 's center is lifted out of the battlefield uninjured and sane , if his family and home life before and after are n't prominent in the picture , the movie is diminished as a film which says something about war and becomes a simpler story of growing up , of jeopardy overcome . 
That 's what happens to Charlie Sheen 's character at the end of Platoon , and that 's what happens to Jake Gyllenhaal 's character at the end of Jarhead . 
It is easy to understand why Jane Fonda abominated The Deer Hunter . 
The Vietnamese characters are not sympathetic or deep , the American soldiers are , and the movie ends with the survivors sitting around the table , singing God Bless America . 
But that simplistic summary , and Fonda 's hostility , mischaracterise the subtlety and complexity of Cimino 's feature : the tender slowness with which he describes the home town the conscripts come from , which makes you understand the coldness of the American war machine , the depth of the betrayal involved in hurling trusting young patriots into an incomprehensible nightmare for which their upbringing has not prepared them , and the true , lingering nature of war wounds . 
And even The Deer Hunter , like all Hollywood war films , carries a morally flawed premise that the world can not rely on the US film industry to correct : namely that the only truly important thing , in wars waged by Americans , is what happens to the Americans .

2005-12-17,"The war in Iraq has had at least one redeeming feature . 
Along with events in Afghanistan , it has revived serious debate into some of the most important and long-standing issues in history and politics . 
Type the four words `` Iraq '' , `` Afghanistan '' , `` America '' and `` empire '' into Google , for instance , and you get around 3.5 million hits . 
There are the usual mad bloggers and propaganda rants but there is also a wealth of discussion on offer that expands every day . 
Is the US an empire ? 
If so , what sort of empire ? 
Is imperialism good or bad , or sometimes both ? 
And , of course : why has it proved so hard for America , the most formidable military and economic power the world has seen , to effect its will ? 
The passion behind this on-screen questioning is evident . 
So , very often , is a limited understanding of what imperial ventures have usually involved . 
In part , this is understandable . 
Before 1939 most of the world was still ruled by empires of some kind , as had been the case for much of recorded history . 
Since the second world war and decolonisation , however , most people have drawn their impressions of empire as a mode of rule less from direct experience than from one of two powerful mythologies . 
Some still veer towards the old , conservative mythology of maps drenched in pink and brave pith-helmeted sahibs doing selfless , transforming work for `` native '' peoples . 
But this view has increasingly retreated before a rival , post-colonial mythology . 
According to this , empires -LRB- especially European ones -RRB- always rested overwhelmingly on force and invariably provoked desperate resistance that ultimately painfully triumphed . 
Clearly antagonistic , these two selective visions none the less have something in common . 
They both make empires out to have been more powerful than historically was often the case . 
Some variants and examples of empire have proved powerful and durable . 
China , for example , is essentially a land-based empire , forged over the centuries by conquest and migration , which has managed to reposition itself as a nation state . 
And the kind of `` informal empire '' that Britain ran in parts of the world in the 19th century is also very much with us today . 
The US has no conventional colonies and may be in trouble in Iraq . 
But it retains military and naval bases in some 130 countries , and consequently the potential for influence over and intervention in them ; and it possesses - as every mighty empire has done - a network of supportive and tractable client states , including , arguably , Britain . 
Direct overseas empire , however , has tended to be more uncertain and more vulnerable . 
As the political scientist Stephen Walt has written , in words that should be inscribed in gold in the Oval Office and at 10 Downing Street , it is `` extremely difficult to project power across water and on to a foreign shore '' . 
The histories of the old European empires demonstrate this clearly enough . 
Even at the height of their imperial power , there were countries - such as Afghanistan - where the British were never able to establish themselves successfully ; and others - such as Egypt - where their rule was only tenuous . 
As for India , the jewel in Victoria 's Crown Imperial , the British only held on to it for as long as they did by way of an army and police force that were overwhelmingly made up of Indians , and by collaborating with Indian princes who continued to rule a third of the subcontinent . 
But the most difficult form of empire by far to carry off successfully - and this is where imperial history becomes acutely relevant - has been the well-meaning , transformative variant . 
Neocon politicians and intellectuals who are willing to admit to the existence of a US empire , such as Dinesh D'Souza , often argue that American interventionism is better and purer than old-style , Old World imperialisms , because to a unique degree it strives to make the world a better place . 
Yet such American idealism - which is real enough - represents one of the ways in which present-day foreign policy closely mirrors imperial ventures in the past . 
Ancient Rome , Qing China , Napoleonic France and conspicuously imperial Britain did not simply invade and occupy other people 's lands out of economic greed . 
In each case , empire was also driven at times by the desire to spread improvement , and to export cultural and political practices that were seen as better , fairer and more civilised . 
Viewed this way , George Bush 's desire to implant US-style democracy in the Middle East , along with greater religious freedoms , women 's rights and the rule of law - by force of arms if necessary - is profoundly reminiscent of past British imperial practices , which may be one reason why Tony Blair and the new Tory leader have supported the project so enthusiastically . 
In the 19th and early 20th centuries , British imperialists too frequently sought to deploy their power to export representative government , the rule of law , women 's education and the abolition of slavery , and sometimes even secured a measure of success . 
This week 's elections keep open the prospect that Iraq might also ultimately be regarded as a success . 
But there is an obvious difficulty involved in this kind of aspirational imperialism . 
It is hard to convince people that you mean them well if you are looking at them down the barrel of a gun . 
Moreover , imperial idealism frequently loses out to the practicalities of rule . 
Instead of exporting what they perceived to be rational , modern , humane government to their colonies , the British often found themselves propping up deeply unattractive and corrupt princelings and client rulers because this was the cheapest way of maintaining control . 
It remains to be seen how far , and how durably , the US will achieve anything better in Iraq . 
The gulf between imperial ideals and empire on the ground has customarily proved disillusioning not only for colonial peoples but also for some in the occupying power . 
In the past , anti-imperialists in Britain , such as Richard Cobden or George Orwell , regularly argued that overseas adventurism was detracting from the nation 's decency and liberty . 
British anti-imperialists also argued , exactly like the author and journalist Chalmers Johnson is doing now in the US , that heavy expenditure on an overseas presence and military action abroad undermined the economic wellbeing of ordinary working people at home . 
But , while current events have revived awareness that seeking to remodel other countries can be a difficult and chancey business even for the invaders , there is one respect in which this has come to be true in the present to a degree that never applied in the past . 
Adam Smith , who distrusted empire , argued that only when `` all the different quarters of the world '' were able to inspire `` mutual fear '' would nations finally begin to respect the integrity of each other 's borders . 
In the most horrible of ways , al-Qaida is after a fashion testing this very premise . 
In the past , the imperialism of the west , like that of the rest , was often difficult - for the doers as well as for their victims ; but western states were none the less usually able to dispatch forces overseas against non-western peoples without any fear of being attacked themselves . 
That kind of immunity is probably now a thing of the past .

2005-12-24,"Danger and anti-war stance keep celebrities away Shows now depend on Christian hip-hop groups During world war two American troops away from home for Christmas were entertained by Marlene Dietrich , Bing Crosby and the Marx Brothers . 
Even in Vietnam Bob Hope was guaranteed to put in an appearance . 
But soldiers in Iraq are more likely to get a show from a Christian hip-hop group , a country singer you have probably never heard of and two cheerleaders for the Dallas Cowboys . 
Just as the seemingly intractable nature of the war has led to a growing recruitment crisis , so the United Services Organisation , which has been putting on shows for the troops since the second world war , is struggling to get celebrities to sign up for even a short tour of duty . 
It is a far cry from the days following the September 11 2001 attacks , when some of the biggest names in show business , from Jennifer Lopez to Brad Pitt , rallied to the cause . 
`` After 9\/11 we could n't have had enough airplanes for the people who were volunteering to go , '' Wayne Newton , the Las Vegas crooner who succeeded Bob Hope as head of USO 's talent recruiting effort , told USA Today . 
`` Now with 9\/11 being as far removed as it is , the war being up one day and down the next , it becomes increasingly difficult to get people to go . '' 
Newton said many celebrities have been wary of going because they think it might be seen that they are endorsing the war . 
`` And I say it 's not . 
I tell them these men and women are over there because our country sent them , and we have the absolute necessity to try to bring them as much happiness as we can . '' 
Fear is also a factor . 
`` They 're scared , '' country singer Craig Morgan , who is in Iraq on the USO 's Hope and Freedom Tour 2005 , told USA Today . 
`` It 's understandable . 
It 's not a safe and fun place and a lot of people do n't want to take the chance . '' 
The USO was founded in 1941 as a way of boosting morale for the military . 
For most of that time Bob Hope , who made his first appearance in 1942 and his last in 1990 , was its most recognisable face , famed for putting on Christmas extravaganzas on aircraft carriers and American bases during the Vietnam war . 
Thousands of performers signed up to play the `` foxhole circuit '' during the second world war , but the USO has a much smaller list . 
Some of the entertainers still willing to travel are die-hard true believers - rock musician Ted Nugent carried a Glock handgun to shows in Iraq last year and said in a radio interview that he manned a machine gun on a Humvee . 
But many of the USO 's regular performers are fierce critics of the war , among them the comic and star of Good Morning Vietnam , Robin Williams , who told USA Today he would like to return to the Middle East in the spring for what would be his fourth tour since 2002 . 
`` I 'm there for the -LRB- troops -RRB- , not for W , '' he said in a reference to the president . 
`` Go , man . 
You wo n't forget it . 
You 'll meet amazing people , '' is his message to stars that ask him about the tours . 
But the comedian said he mostly tries to keep politics out of the show after he did a few jokes about Bush 's brainpower at a base in 2003 and got a chilly reception . 
Other critics of the war who regularly perform include the leftwing comedian Al Franken -LRB- who is headlining the current tour along with Christian hip-hop group Souljahz -RRB- and the punk legend and actor Henry Rollins , one of the Bush administrations most vocal critics . 
The tradition of beautiful women thrilling the troops has continued - although while Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell showed up in Korea and Vietnam could boast Raquel Welch , in Iraq they have had to make do with sometime pop singer and reality TV star Jessica Simpson .

2005-12-28,"Shock , awe and Hobbes have backfired on America 's neocons Iraq has shown the hubris of a geostrategy that welds the philosophy of the Leviathan to military and technological power The tragic irony of the 21st century is that just as faith in technology collapsed on the world 's stock markets in 2000 , it came to power in the White House and Pentagon . 
For the Project for a New American Century 's ambition of `` full-spectrum dominance '' - in which its country could `` fight and win multiple , simultaneous major-theatre wars '' - was a monster borne up by the high tide of techno euphoria of the 1990s . 
Ex-hippies talked of a wired age of Aquarius . 
The fall of the Berlin wall and the rise of the internet , we were told , had ushered in Adam Smith 's dream of overflowing abundance , expanding liberty and perpetual peace . 
Fukuyama speculated that history was over , leaving us just to hoard and spend . 
Technology meant a new paradigm of constant growth without inflation or recession . 
But darker dreams surfaced in America 's military universities . 
The theorists of the `` revolution in military affairs '' predicted that technology would lead to easy and perpetual US dominance of the world . 
Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Peters advised on `` future warfare '' at the Army War College - prophesying in 1997 a coming `` age of constant conflict '' . 
Thomas Barnett at the Naval War College assisted Vice-Admiral Cebrowski in developing `` network-centric warfare '' . 
General John Jumper of the air force predicted a planet easily mastered from air and space . 
American forces would win everywhere because they enjoyed what was unashamedly called the `` God 's - eye '' view of satellites and GPS : the `` global information grid '' . 
This hegemony would be welcomed as the cutting edge of human progress . 
Or at worst , the military geeks candidly explained , US power would simply terrify others into submitting to the stars and stripes . 
Shock and Awe : Achieving Rapid Dominance - a key strategic document published in 1996 - aimed to understand how to destroy the `` will to resist before , during and after battle '' . 
For Harlan Ullman of the National Defense University , its main author , the perfect example was the atom bomb at Hiroshima . 
But with or without such a weapon , one could create an illusion of unending strength and ruthlessness . 
Or one could deprive an enemy of the ability to communicate , observe and interact - a macro version of the sensory deprivation used on individuals - so as to create a `` feeling of impotence '' . 
And one must always inflict brutal reprisals against those who resist . 
An alternative was the `` decay and default '' model , whereby a nation 's will to resist collapsed through the `` imposition of social breakdown '' . 
All of this came to be applied in Iraq in 2003 , and not merely in the March bombardment called `` shock and awe '' . 
It has been usual to explain the chaos and looting in Baghdad , the destruction of infrastructure , ministries , museums and the national library and archives , as caused by a failure of Rumsfeld 's planning . 
But the evidence is this was at least in part a mask for the destruction of the collective memory and modern state of a key Arab nation , and the manufacture of disorder to create a hunger for the occupier 's supervision . 
As the Sddeutsche Zeitung reported in May 2003 , US troops broke the locks of museums , ministries and universities and told looters : `` Go in Ali Baba , it 's all yours ! '' 
For the American imperial strategists invested deeply in the belief that through spreading terror they could take power . 
Neoconservatives such as Paul Wolfowitz , Richard Perle and the recently indicted Lewis `` Scooter '' Libby , learned from Leo Strauss that a strong and wise minority of humans had to rule over the weak majority through deception and fear , rather than persuasion or compromise . 
They read Le Bon and Freud on the relationship of crowds to authority . 
But most of all they loved Hobbes 's Leviathan . 
While Hobbes saw authority as free men 's chosen solution to the imperfections of anarchy , his 21st century heirs seek to create the fear that led to submission . 
And technology would make it possible and beautiful . 
On the logo of the Pentagon 's Information Awareness Office , the motto is Scientia est potentia - knowledge is power . 
The IAO promised `` total information awareness '' , an all-seeing eye spilling out a death-ray gaze over Eurasia . 
Congressional pressure led the IAO to close , but technospeak , half-digested political theory and megalomania still riddle US thinking . 
Barnett , in The Pentagon 's New Map and Blueprint for Action , calls for a `` systems administrator '' force to be dispatched with the military , to `` process '' conquered countries . 
The G8 and a few others are the `` Kantian core '' , writes Barnett , warming over the former Blair adviser Robert Cooper 's poisonous guff from 2002 ; their job is to export their economy and politics by force to the unlucky `` Hobbesian gap '' . 
Imperialism is imagined as an industrial technique to remake societies and cultures , with technology giving sanction to those who intervene . 
The Afghanistan war of 2001 taught the wrong lessons . 
The US assumed this was the model of how a small , special forces-dominated campaign , using local proxies and calling in gunships or airstrikes , would sweep away opposition . 
But all Afghanistan showed was how an outside power could intervene in a finely balanced civil war . 
The one-eyed Mullah Omar 's great escape on his motorbike was a warning that the God 's - eye view can miss the human detail . 
The problem for the US today is that Leviathan has shot his wad . 
Iraq revealed the hubris of the imperial geostrategy . 
One small nation can tie down a superpower . 
Air and space supremacy do not give command on the ground . 
People ca n't be terrorised into identification with America . 
The US has proved able to destroy massively - but not create , or even control . 
Afghanistan and Iraq lie in ruins , yet the occupiers cower behind concrete mountains . 
The spin machine is on full tilt to represent Iraq as a success . 
Peters , in New Glory : Expanding America 's Supremacy , asserts : `` Our country is a force for good without precedent '' ; and Barnett , in Blueprint , says : `` The US military is a force for global good that ... has no equal . '' 
Both offer ambitious plans for how the US is going to remake the third world in its image . 
There is a violent hysteria to the boasts . 
The narcissism of a decade earlier has given way to an extrovert rage at those who have resisted America 's will since 2001 . 
Both urge utter ruthlessness in crushing resistance . 
In November 2004 , Peters told Fox News that in Falluja `` the best outcome , frankly , is if they 're all killed '' . 
But he directs his real fury at France and Germany : `` A haggard Circe , Europe dulled our senses and fooled us into believing in her attractions . 
But the dugs are dry in Germany and France . 
They deluded us into prolonging the affair long after our attentions should have turned to ... India , South Africa , Brazil . '' 
While a good Kleinian therapist may be able to help Peters work through his weaning trauma , only America can cure its post 9\/11 mixture of paranoia and megalomania . 
But Britain - and other allied states - can help . 
The US needs to discover , like a child that does not know its limits , that there is a world outside its body and desires , beyond even the reach of its toys , that suffers too .
