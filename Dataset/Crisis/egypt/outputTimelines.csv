''In a marathon all night session , Islamists in the constituent assembly rush to complete the draft of the constitution , with almost all non Islamists boycotting the gathering .Morsi sets a Dec. 15 date for a referendum , fueling further protests .Morsi sets the referendum date for the disputed charter for Dec. 15 .A week later , he cancels the decrees that gave him immunity from judicial oversight .Islamists protest outside the Supreme Constitutional Court , blocking judges from entering to rule on the legality of the constituent assembly .More than 100,000 protesters march on the presidential palace , demanding the cancellation of the referendum and the writing of a new constitution .The next day , Islamists attack a peaceful anti Morsi sit in outside the palace , sparking street battles that leave at least 10 dead .Days later , Morsi rescinds his initial decrees , but maintains the date of the referendum .Unofficial results show that 56 % voted yes for the draft constitution .Islamists hold massive rally in the city of Alexandria to show solidarity with religious clerics .In the final vote on the constitution , it passes with a 64 % yes vote .The Egyptian Central Bank announces that foreign reserves drained to $ 15 billion from $ 36 billion in 2010 have fallen to a `` critical minimum '' and starts new measures to stop a sharp slide in the value of the Egyptian pound .The pound 's decline slows but does n't stop , and now stands at just over 7 to the dollar , compared to as strong as 5.5 to the dollar in 2010 .Hundreds of thousands hold protests in Tahrir Square and nationwide against Morsi on the 2 year anniversary of the start of the revolt against Mubarak , and clashes erupt in many places .The following day , residents of the city of Port Said stage protests , angered by a court ruling convicting and sentencing to death a group of local soccer fans for a 2012 stadium riot .Police crack down hard in Port Said , killing more than 40 protesters , and the city and others nearby go into near revolt .Much of the anger is focused at Morsi , who praised the police for their crackdown .Morsi schedules elections for a new lower house of parliament to begin in April .But the election is postponed after a court rules that the upper house which is carrying out legislative duties until a lower house is created improperly approved the law governing the election .It remains unknown when elections will be held .A Muslim mob attacks the main cathedral of the Coptic Orthodox Church when Christians hold a funeral and protest there over four Christians killed in sectarian violence outside of Cairo the day before .One person is killed in clashes at the cathedral , and Pope Tawadros II publicly blames Morsi for failing to protect the building , thought the president condemns the attack .Morsi reshuffles the Cabinet , bringing in more ministers from the Muslim Brotherhood to total 11 members of the 36 member government .Officials say the changes aim to finalize long stalled negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for crucial $ 4.8 billion loan , which requires sensitive reductions to fuel and food subsidies that take up a large chunk of the budget .A deal on the loan has still not been reached .A mob beats to death four Egyptian Shiites in their home in a village on the edge of Cairo .Morsi condemns the attack , but critics blame virulent anti Shiite rhetoric by his hard line Islamist allies , fueled by Syria 's civil war .A week earlier , Morsi shared a stage with hard line clerics at a rally , sitting silently as they denounced Shiites as `` filthy . ''Millions of Egyptians take to the streets in Cairo and other cities calling for Morsi to step down in a massive display of anger and frustration .The demonstrations are largely peaceful , although 16 people , half of them in clashes outside the Muslim Brotherhood 's Cairo headquarters , are killed in protest related violence nationwide .Organizers vow to keep up the protests until Morsi resigns .Large scale demonstrations continue , and Egypt 's powerful military gives the two sides 48 hours to resolve their disputes , or it will impose its own solution .The military 's statement appears to back the protesters , telling the government to respond to their demands .Military officials disclose main details of their plan if no agreement is reached : replacing Morsi with an interim administration , canceling the Islamist based constitution and calling elections in a year .Morsi delivers a late night speech in which he pledges to defend his legitimacy and vows not to step down .Deadline for Morsi and opponents to come to agreement passes , Morsi standing firm .The military chief met with opposition and religious leaders and sent soldiers to the state TV's newsroom in what were seen as first steps toward taking power .Egypt's military chief says Morsi has been replaced by Adly Mansour , the chief justice of constitutional court .Adly Mansour is sworn in as the nation's interim president , taking over hours after the military ousted the Islamist President Mohammed Morsi .Adly dissolves the Islamist dominated upper house of parliament as soldiers open fire on mostly Islamist protesters in Cairo demanding restoration of Morsi , killing at least one person .After an initial announcement that Mansour had named ElBaradei to the key post of prime minister , a spokesman for the interim president backs away , saying consultations are still underway .Secular and liberal factions wrangle with the sole Islamist group that backed Morsi's ouster over installing a new prime minister , reflecting the difficulties in building a broad coalition behind a new leadership .Morsi's opponents and supporters stage huge rallies to push their respective causes ."

inherit a nation mired in economic crisis and desperate to move beyond military rule and the corrupt legacy of deposed President Hosni Mubarak .Egypt's new parliament holds its inaugural session , and a sense of wonder is mixed with the gravity of a country still under military rule and beset by economic turmoil .Egypt's volatile presidential race is jolted when the election commission disqualifies three controversial front-runners  the nation's former spy chief and two impassioned Islamists  just five weeks before voters go to the polls .Egyptians begin two days of voting in a landmark contest between a stirring political Islam and a secularist vision embodied by men connected to the old regime .The life sentence imposed on toppled President Hosni Mubarak for complicity in the deaths of hundreds of protesters marks an unprecedented milestone in Egypt's path toward democracy .The battle between Egypt's military leaders and the ascendant Muslim Brotherhood over the country's political fate dramatically sharpens when the nation's constitutional court dissolves the Islamist-dominated parliament while upholding the right of an ally of deposed leader Hosni Mubarak to remain on the presidential election ballot .The Muslim Brotherhood claims victory in Egypt's landmark presidential runoff election , but its historic rise to power is blunted by a decree from the ruling military council to greatly limit the authority of the nation's next leader .Egyptian officials deny reports that deposed President Hosni Mubarak was clinically dead after he suffered a stroke and slipped out of consciousness at a prison hospital in Cairo , according to state and independent news media .Conflicting reports about the former leader's health emerged after a report by the official state news agency MENA that Mubarak was declared clinically dead  after he was transferred from a prison hospital to a nearby military hospital. .The report could not be independently verified .Conflicting reports about Hosni Mubarak's health leave Egypt confused and suspicious .His near death  strikes many as just another political ploy .Protesters return en masse to Egypt's Tahrir Square as the Muslim Brotherhood and other groups stage a sit-in to protest actions by Egypt's military council ahead of presidential runoff results .Muslim Brotherhood candidate Mohamed Morsi is declared Egypt's first freely elected president , defeating Ahmed Shafik , the last prime minister to serve deposed leader Hosni Mubarak .A move by Egypt's ruling generals to revive martial law is blunted as a court strikes down a government decree that had allowed soldiers and military intelligence services to arrest civilians during the nation's political turmoilLawmakers defy a court order and reconvene the dissolved parliament , a symbolic victory for President Mohamed Morsi , who had ordered it to meet despite a recent court ruling that disbanded the chamber because of electoral violations .U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton meets for the first time with new President Mohamed Morsi .Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi issues a blanket pardon for hundreds of activists arrested during the revolution and its turbulent aftermath , in what was widely viewed as a morally wise but politically timed move from a leader attempting to calm his critics amid social and economic turmoil .Clashes erupt across Egypt over President Mohamed Morsi's decree expanding his authority , a move that sharpens lines between Islamists and those who fear the president is stealing power in order to edge the country closer to Islamic law .Egypt's Islamist-dominated constitutional assembly passes a rushed draft of a constitution to ease public anger against President Mohamed Morsi's expanded powers and preempt an expected court decision to disband the chamber the following weekend .Morsi rescinds his 2-week-old decree seizing broad powers and putting his office beyond judicial oversight .But the move fails to calm unrest as the president refuses to cancel a referendum later in the month on a proposed constitution drafted by an Islamist-dominated assembly .Morsi scores a victory in his push for an Islamist state when a controversial new constitution is approved by 64 % of voters in a two-round referendum .But the secular opposition accuses the president's Islamist allies of fraud , portending more conflict between Muslim Brotherhood supporters and a newly collaborative opposition , the National Salvation Front , which includes Nobel laureate Mohamed ElBaradei and former Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa .Morsi invokes emergency powers in Ismailia , Port Said and Suez to quell riots that have killed nearly 50 and raised questions on whether his Islamist-backed government can secure order amid intensifying political turmoil .The U.S. government releases $ 250 million in aid to Morsi's government in exchange for pledges of political and economic reforms .Secretary of State John F. Kerry serves notice that the Obama administration will keep close watch on how Morsi honors his commitments and that future aid will be dependent on fulfilling promises of building democracy .Egypt is also struggling to meet conditions for a $ 4.8-billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund .Egyptian state prosecutors order the arrest of popular television satirist Bassem Youssef for allegedly insulting Islam and Morsi .The order reflects an accelerated campaign to stifle protest and opposition to the Islamist president as it follows the arrest a week earlier of five prominent pro-democracy activists .An alcohol-free hotel in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada opens , testament to the spreading influence of Islamic values in Egyptian commerce and society .The opening , marked by the ceremonial dumping of liquor bottle contents on the resort's sidewalks , is cheered by Islamists but denounced by secular political and business leaders as a threat to Egypt's tourism industry , already devastated by two years of political turmoil .Morsi reshuffles his Cabinet , strengthening the Muslim Brotherhood's hold on power and angering opposition leaders who had demanded more secular ministers to balance Islamist influence in the government's upper ranks .Nineteen Americans are convicted on charges of operating illegally funded organizations for their work helping Egyptians build civil society institutions .The U.S. defendants , all but one already out of the country , are sentenced to five-year prison terms .The move angers Washington and Egypt's secular opposition , as it is seen as an effort to repress rival political forces challenging Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood allies .Hundreds of thousands fill town and city centers across Egypt to denounce Morsi on the first anniversary of his inauguration .The protests against his Islamist agenda and heavy-handed moves to shackle political opposition are countered by the turnout of Morsi supporters , leading to deadly clashes and violence that escalates into a massive force demanding the president step down .Egypt's military , which two days earlier had issued an ultimatum that Morsi end the disruptive turmoil paralyzing the country within 48 hours , announces that it has removed him from office and suspended the constitution .Demonstrators celebrate in Cairo's Tahrir Square , restoring the scene of revolutionary chaos that ensued after Mubarak's February 2011 ouster ."
